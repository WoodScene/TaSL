i hear some jingling, thinking of all the dirty possibilities. then i feel a pain on my ass. did she fucking brand me like a cow?! i turn around to see her with a whip in her hand and preparing to thrust the biggest blackest strapon imaginable into my poor vortex of doom. now i'm not one to shy away from some adventure but having satan's ramrod desecrate my fudge factory is what i'm sure meatloaf won't do for love, as won't i.\n\ni'm half tempted to nope out but i'm still hard as a rock so i convince her that i'd gladly try her in the same manner but it's a deal breaker for me. she keeps the whip and loses the strap on. tells me to whip her while we go at it. i do it. she says harder. i do. harder. i do. harder.. i can't keep doing this. i'm all for beating her with my dick but not a whip. i don't want to go to jail and experience what i narrowly escaped.\n\ni make it like a show of sexual intensity and throw it behind me, flip her over and go double time. long story short  (or longer, whatever) once she's finished for the last time, she breaks down in tears. i don't know what to do. i wanted to keep going but i just couldn't. plus it was killing the vibe. she starts crying and wailing about her ex. i comfort her, tell her she's better off without him. he apparently cheated on her when they were going to get married next year. fucker. \n\nwe get partially dressed and talk a bit more before one of her friends come in to see if she was alright since they could hear the sobbing outside. probably thought *i* was the one with the whip and strapon. fuckers. after she's calmed down i say my goodbyes, make sure she isn't going to kill herself or anything and then try to find my way home. still drunk, very blue-balled and just angry about everything in the world. give me a god damn break.\n [OUT] ",

 about halfway through the road started to be a bit less manageable with a rising middle ridge and some small puddles. at this moment i keep repeating to my self that i'd be an idiot if i were to continue.\n\na bit further the puddles started to get bigger. i needed to keep swerving left and right so that i could keep my tyres on the dry and prevent the dirt ridge from hitting the bottom of my car. got some nice skits in as well. \n\nall went well until i made a couple of mistakes. i got into a patch of mud and my right tyre lost traction. so i braked, which was the next mistake, now i was standing still on a slippery surface. trying to go forward was fruitless, going backward just marginally better.\n\nwhat i should have done at this point was go a couples of meters back to get a good velocity to pass the mud and the big puddle after it. what i did instead was try to go with just one meter and drop my right wheel into a muddy hole. the time is 00:00. \n\nthe first thing i tried to get out was to use ticks to get some traction, but that didn't help much. the only thing i managed was to step into the puddle getting my feet wet, and getting mud everywhere. it's clear this isn't going to work. this is an agricultural area, so surely i can find someone with a tractor willing to pull me out? so i start walking.\n\nabout 300 meter on i reach the main road, which means i drove about 1.5 km on the dmuddy road. you could say i made it pretty far. after walking 1km i reach the first house. lights off and nobody answers the door. the next kilometre and three houses i did manage to get to speak to people, but none of them had a tractor. but each of them were certain that their neighbour would be able to help out. they couldn't.\n\na bit further i made it to a small dairy farm, with a tractor i could actually see! help at last! either they weren't home or very heavy sleepers, but the door didn't open. as it was the last house i could see i decided to head back again.\n\non my way back i noticed that one of the people that i had spoken to had left a wooden plank for me on his driveway. that might actually work to get me enough traction to get out. but however deed i managed to push the wooden plank underneith the wheel, which was 2 cm at best, the wheel just kept spinning. the time is now 01:45. \n\nnot ready to give up just yet, i decided to head the other way. i did manage to find a house lot with various tractors in sight. but unfortunately the doorbell wasn't connected, and i didn't want to bang on the doors. guess i'll have to come back here in the morning.\n\nso here i am right now, bunkering down for a night in my car, typing this right in the middle of my tifu. since sleep probably isn't going to happen, i am now writing this story for you at 03:00.\n\n**pictues** imgur album, including new images and descriptions: http://imgur.com/a/wvheu \n\n**update** so after being unsuccesfull in finding help i had decided to just wait it out. the night was a bit cold at 10c (50f), so sleep wasn't very effective. i went out again just after 6 since that's a normal time for farmers. when i reached the address where they had loads of tractors someone just pulled out of the driveway, not really even paying attention to me. because his truck was so wide, he couldn't see me waving after him :-(. after that i started to walk in the other direction again hoping that i'd be able to see some other farms, but that didn't provide anything. at least i got to see my very first wild badger while walking through the forest!\n\nso back to the first address at around 07:30, hoping someone else had woken up in the mean time. i saw that a dog was walking around freely, which came to say hello. i yelled hello through the open door and was greeted by a nice lady. after a quick introduction of the situation she told me that she'd be able to send a worker to help me out when they'd arrive around 08:00. so i went back to my car, the worker came on a tractor and pulled me backwards a couple meters. i thanked him for pulling me out and gave him the €20 that he'd asked for. a towing company would have probably charged me €100 - €200 because of the location. so that single note went from my wallet into his hands faster than he was expecting :-). \n\nwith my new found freedom i got a bit of speed, went around the muddy pothole this time and safely finished the last couple hundred meters of the path. nearly hit two smaller trees because of some less than controlled skidding, but at least i made it. from there i went straight to the carwash to do some very much needed cleaning. time to hit the shower.\n [OUT] ",

i pulled the pan off the hob really fast, and here's the fuck up; when i pulled it, the butter splashed up the side of the pan and over the edge, falling straight towards my foot.\n\nburning hot butter lands right on my foot and all i could do was wipe it with my hand because i'm more worried about the situation with my butter. so me being slightly high and very determined to get these brownies in the oven, i ignored the slight stinging on my foot and left it. no cold water, no ice, no nothing. just my slightly red foot.\n\ni made the brownies, they tasted amazing, and they looked pretty good too, although they were messy to bag up. i slapped a large plaster (bandaid) on my foot for the time being, grabbed the brownies and managed to transport them all the way to my friends house the night before so she could keep them safe, as i couldn't be dragging the brownies around at our actual prom. \n\nfast forward to after i had made it back home, i wanted to test out a brownie so i ate one and then waited a couple of hours. i didn't think they had actually worked because i couldn't feel anything at all for ages, but all of a sudden i feel like an alien on a foreign planet. everything is moving, and i keep feeling like i'm losing my memory every five seconds. and then i feel the slight stinging in my foot.\n\ni peel back the plaster out of curiosity, and i'm greeted by three huge blisters that cover the entire top space of my foot. because i'm high, i panic and the only thing i could think to do was to put the plaster back over the blister and pretend like i hadn't seen it.\n\nthe next morning i'm really excited for my prom, and i'm getting ready when i notice my foot feels slightly wet. little did i know, it was leaking blister fluid all over the floor and because i'd burnt it so badly i think the pain receptors had disintegrated because i could feel anything at all unless it was around the edges. i bandage it up and shove my foot in a cute pair of high heels.\n\nat prom it's stinging like crazy, and all i can think about. by the time we got back from my prom to get ready for the after party, my whole foot had swollen and where my heel had been higher than my toes in the high heels, the fluid in the blister had moved towards the front of the blister creating a massive bulge that looked really horrendous. even my prom date was literally freaked out by it because it was super gross.\n\nwe get the the after prom, i sell the brownies and i'm sad to be walking around in flat shoes with a massive bandage on, telling everyone how dumb i was ;)\n\nanyway, so a week on and it's still disgusting to look at and really painful, i had never really burnt myself before so i wasn't sure if it was that bad or not. i had been putting aloe vera gel on it and then bandaging it up so that i could carry on with my daily life without having trouble walking. i decided to see if i could find any burn creams in my local pharmacy, because i thought, hey that's pretty bad i should probably do something about it. \n\nwhen i asked the pharmacist, she said that she only had prescription burn creams, and she would have to see the severity of the burn to be able to allow me to have the cream. i'm sitting in this weird little room, unravelling my disgusting foot in front of this stranger and she takes one look and tells me to go to a&e because it's a really serious burn and i could loose a foot if i don't get it looked at.\n\nokay lady, but have you seen how long a&e wait times are? i don't have time for that :') so i took the cream and was really careful with cleaning and wrapping my foot up for about two months, and then finally it heeled enough to be put in a sock without any pain. so yeah, it's been two hears, and i've got this massive scar on my right foot that looks like a splat, and i guess it was a huge fuck up and a half.\n\n \n\nnsfw - pictures of my foot (graphic)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/ybi8f \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/181xo\n [OUT] ",

i needed to throw up...\"\n\nsilence descends as douchepants mcgee now has the bathroom to himself again, and we try to resume our evening activities. that silence was short-lived, however, as minutes later we hear an ungodly sound start to emanate from the bathroom. it starts like a low growl, and then climbs in pitch and volume. i can't think of a good way to describe it accurately, but it was probably close to a yodeler gargling hot lava trying to impersonate a police siren. it sounded like satan himself was violently deflowering a banshee in our bathroom. the sound is punctuated by mad pounding on the bathroom door (he must have been flailing at it like crazy). we huddle on our couch in fear, staring at the bathroom door, expecting the apocalypse. then the sound vanishes, just as quickly as it had started. \n\ni get up slowly to go investigate, and crack the door open. the sight i am greeted with is not an angry demon cat, but rather the giant constipation-breaking shit pile of an angry demon cat. in the sink. why he ignored the litter box (or the fucking floor for that matter) to jump up and squat awkwardly in the tiny sink to deposit his massive, steaming casserole of cat shit is beyond me. but i decide to clean this monstrosity up, to a) get rid of the awful stench now wafting throughout the apartment and b) pay it forward to sober me in the morning. i get it cleaned up rather uneventfully, or as uneventfully as a warm pile of diarrhea can be cleaned from a sink while an angry cat is accosting you.\n\nthe rest of the night wraps up quickly. we finish drinking and get ready for bed. it's been a couple of hours of drinking since i last peed, and i definitely need to go before i commit to sleep, but the cat has gone full rambo now and is prowling the bathroom trying to massacre my feet the minute i open the door. \n\ni get to bed and fall asleep, unsure of if i was ever successful in braving the temple of doom to take a goodnight pee. thankfully my friend informs me the next morning that we left her a glorious series of voice messages, including one where i drunkenly ~~complain~~ cry \"there's a cat living in our bathroom and he's mean and i really need to pee but when i go in he growls at me and then i can't pee anymore.\" no wonder i woke up with such a full bladder. \n\nrest of the cat's stay is pretty uneventful, he mellows out, and eventually we find his owner the next day. turns out he did come from outside, somehow escaped his owners house, wandered down the block to our apartment, pushed open the broken fire escape door, then somehow got in through the inner apartment door, and ended up in the hallway.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: just like most posts here, it didn’t happen today. this happened over a period of time. there is a tl;dr at the bottom if you want to skip the wall of text.\n\n\nmany years ago i met a girl (we’ll call her a) while playing an online game. it was pretty fun, and we played a lot together. of course, that turned into us talking a lot in and out of the game. we pretty much just never stopped talking the entire time we’ve known each other. yeah, i fell for her. she did say no; in fact she said no twice over a period of a few years. \n\n\neven then, we still didn’t really stop talking to each other. she was my best friend all those years. then one day, i was kinda mucking around and told her i find her friend that’s in university with her cute (i saw a photo), and jokingly asked her to set me up with said girl. so what happened was that i ended up being friends that other girl (we’ll call her b). thing is though, i never really got attracted to b. \n\n\na and i started to flirt with each other endlessly, it was really fun. but then i started getting really cheesy and saying a whole load of sweet lines to her. at first i was doing it for the laughs, but she was reciprocating to it. so i kept going at it and we basically were talking like we’re actually together. then it hit me, and in my head i was like “ah shit… here it is again.” yeah, once again, for the third time i fell for her. getting rejected twice should have made me not want to go for her again.\n\n\nbut i did, and i told her how i felt, and she said she loves me too. go figure, i got third time lucky! it was fucking great; literally the happiest i’ve ever been. it’s going really great, then a few months afterwards, she flew to where i live to see me. that was honestly the best week and a half of my life. never did i think i would be spending time with a girl that met online, and after many years i actually did meet her irl, and is also the love of my life. \n\n\ni went to visit her for her birthday sometime after she visited. again, extremely great experience, happy as fuck, couldn’t ask for anything better. at this point i still couldn’t find a job so i decided to go back to university again. i initially applied for a post-graduate degree.\n\n\nhere is where the “i fucked up” section starts. i did get accepted. the thing is, it was where she lives. i purposefully applied to study in the same place she lives. i mean, i always wanted to move to that city, but her being there really got me the motivation to actually do move there. so, basically, my personal goal of living in this city was fuelled by my desire to be with her. nothing fucking mattered, just the fact that she’s there did.\n\n\ni moved, carrying a lot of my stuff, said bye to many of my friends (and family) back home, and started anew here. it’s been really difficult (i live on noodles and cans of tuna a lot of the time, it’s really bad), and for the most part i’ve been barely coping. when i moved, she let me stay at her place for a week while i wait for my friend to have room at his place so i can stay there until i find my own. i’m really grateful for them; they gave me a home when i really needed it. \n\n\nanyways, after some time i finally found a place to stay. also, at the last minute i decided to transfer to another course that i applied for since the initial course i realised isn't for me (and got in). way before this, a switched to this course as well. nice right? being with your girl in university together; sounds like the dream for some, probably not for others. but for me, that was great. however, i made sure i’m not in every single one of her classes because i don’t want to be such a distraction.\n\n\nhere is where the fu really started to ramp up. i’ve started to notice we don’t talk as much as we used to. i never really wondered about it; she’d sleep way later than me and also wake up way later than i do. plus she and i tend to be both busy a lot of the time. i just figured it was a bit hard to communicate because we’re on such different activities/sleep times. we also barely saw each other since i stopped staying at her place. so yeah, not really talking as much, but the love and all that good feeling is still there. \n\n\nwhat i didn’t notice is that the entire time since i moved, things were actually going downhill. this is the fucking thing i realized too fucking late.  i thought i was doing a great job if i’m honest; we never really had any arguments, i show my affection for her a lot and we know what we both want in a relationship so we made sure to work around that. and she was really happy, i really thought things were really great.\n\n\nanyways, valentine’s day hits, and we spent another day together. see, here i was a bit dumb; i forgot to buy a card and a present for her so i just wrote a letter on a nice piece of paper… that’s really all i could give at the time and i told her i’ll get her present later. still, we had a great day together, but at this point i did start to notice the magic fading away, and it really bothered me.\n\n\nfew days later, it was my birthday. sweet! should be a really good day! nope, not really. she was meant to show up at my place, but didn’t. i got frustrated as hell. at this point, because i noticed it all starting to go downhill, everything got to me. every little thing. anyway, she just told me to meet her at a place near where we’re going to have lunch. so i just went there anyway. the whole time though i felt really upset, and i tried so hard to hide it. that didn’t really work. that made her upset; really upset. when we both got back on the train i wasn’t feeling so well so i wanted to go home.\n\n\nthings just got worse. i wanted her to come home with me, but she wouldn’t and flat out cold just told me to go by myself while she goes to the mall to get my present. but, i decided to put up with it and go with her to the mall so we can buy each other’s presents (her valentine’s one from me and my birthday one from her). so we got that all sorted (and had a talk), both of us stopped being upset and i felt that amazing feeling of being with her again and we went home. it really looked like by the end of that day things were looking up again.\n\n\n…nah. it really just got worse and worse, i tried everything i can to save it. she called me a few days before university started to tell me she’s breaking up. that’s when it all hit me; i was just a shit cunt the whole time that didn’t really treat her well at all. \n\n\ni spent the entire weekend before university started feeling like i’m a horrible person. i lost someone that meant the world to me because i’m stupid and selfish. i realized too at this point that i am on my own, in this city, barely being able to have a roof and a bed. i made a terrible mistake of moving here.\n\n\ni still went to university anyway (i’m still attending) and i see her sometimes. the first couple of times my heart just sank but these days, it’s not as bad. i still get hit by the truck of regret though.\n\n\ni did meet a girl a little before the breakup and i did get attracted to her a while after. but the thing is, it’s just because i feel lonely as all hell so i got easily attracted to her wonderful personality. i’m on my own in this city, so she was like the one person i wanted to stay with because i felt like i got nothing. \n\n\ni made some friends in university (really great people in fact). but that didn’t really put most of that shitty feeling away. i thought things are looking better, when in fact i’m just hiding how i really feel every single day. i don’t want them to know that i’m really miserable inside. that i regret moving even though it’s been a lifelong dream to live in this city. \n\n\nbut i still pretend that i am all fine and dandy and happy, because i always think something will happen and that gets my mind off that shit. i can honestly only really hide this for so long. despite everything, i still feel like crap. to the friends i’ve made, i am grateful to have you guys, but i’m sorry that i hide everything from you all.\n\n\ni am barely able to live on welfare and honestly if it weren’t for that i’d be homeless right now. i very rarely eat healthily, i don’t really get the chance to go out and spend time with people, i can’t get a job, and i’m not even doing as well as i should be in school. honestly i thought that as long as things are great with her and she was there to support me that it will be alright to be in this position for some time. but no, i lost her. so this is just now the consequence of my stupidity and selfishness. \n\n\nso here’s something i want to say. if you’re going to move for the one you love, don’t do it blindly like i did. it was a personal goal of mine to move where i live now for a long time, but don’t let it be fueled by wanting to be with someone you love. because when it all goes wrong, it really does all go wrong. if you are going to do this, find other reasons to, make sure you find a job first (which i tried but couldn’t get one and i still moved anyway). the last thing you want is to be way away from your family barely being able to live on your own. yes, i do want to go home (and i’m sure someone here will tell me to go home). however, i want to finish this course because if there’s something that may give me a chance at living a good life and achieve being able to nicely live in this city, i’ll bet everything that this may be able to do it.\n [OUT] ",

(i know, game=nonexistent. i cringe thinking about it). she responds again with \"what are you trying to say?\" and this time i tried to pull the trigger, but shot a blank. my dumbass, forever alone, jerking it till i'm thirty-four ass said \" how would one ask you about getting some head?\" \n\nrip me boys\n\nshe starts going off. \"are you fucking kidding me?\" \"mettaworldeast, what is wrong with you?\" \"what are you even doing?\" i try to flip it as a joke but it's too late. she confirms by saying \"no mettaworldeast, i will not give you head. jesus\" tried to apologize, have not heard back from her, probably scarred her. \n\nit was a gg boys, guess imma be alone out here. if there were a pic of the sequence, 100% would expect to see it on r/cringe.\n [OUT] ",

(apologies for the next part, but it's necessary for the story) needless to say, things got going, and about forty minutes later, i pulled out and came on my fiance's tits. now, anyone who has had sex knows what guys do when they are about to cum, but for any uninitiated, i more or less gave it a couple strokes to completion. mistake.\n\nnow, everyone knows that itching spreads rashes, and we all have staph on our skin which also can be transferred. about 30 minutes later, we had a cigarette and she was dozing off to sleep. i ever so gingerly slid out of bed to brush my teeth and put on some hydrocortisone before bed. i changed, went to the bathroom, and as soon as i lay in bed, the itching started, only this time, it wasn't\nmy neck, my head, or my throat; it was my balls.\n\ni quite literally stopped, mid-itch, and rolled my eyes as i got up to grab more hydrocortisone. just about the time i was putting a quite liberal amount of the white cream on my balls and shaft, my fiancé wakes up and says \"interesting choice of lube; if you're thinking about sticking that in me, you better think again, that shit's gonna burn\"\n\ni exhaled loudly and we both started laughing.\n\ngoddamnit.\n [OUT] ",

we took turns giving each other innocent massages, but slowly, it's vibrations shook a palpable sexual tension over the back three seats of the van. it definitely was not uncommon to feel that way back then, but this was the first time i knew a female was feeling it about me, too. \n\nher massage found its way to my legs. a glancing buzz to my thigh. oddly enough, it was not just me getting the deluxe treatment. sam as well was being given the same genital teasing flyover. she was buzzing our towers, closer than tom cruise in top gun.  \n\nthen, as things reached a critical crossroads, sam passes me a note by way of his phone's notepad. \"let her massage your dick,\" it said. i was shy, very shy, but there was nothing hesitant about the urgent fashion i pecked out the letters n-o on that t9 keyboard. my urgency and reluctance, however, had met its match in sam's ability to manipulate simple text. as quickly as i had typed no, he changed it to yes and \"accidentally\" let hanna see. \n\nnow, one thing we can all agree on, is a young, inexperienced male in the heat of puberty can be seduced by nothing more than a breeze. i was no different. moments later, her hand had slid up my gym shorts and her hands began to explore my crotch. i positioned a blanket over my lap and more or less gave her free reign of my undercarriage. now, despite my lifelong anticipation for what was now happening, it was accompanied by a sudden, saddening realization that she had not developed the same deft stroke that i had grown accustomed. i was the opposite of \"enjoying it\", but had enough worldly awareness to realize what was happening was too rare for me to reject. the setting wasn't great, her technique was worse, but i hope that you all will understand why i felt obligated to try my best to appreciate my circumstances. \n\nfast-forward an hour. imagine all the ways cosmopolitan had steered this poor girl wrong, and sympathize with me. i was paying the price of years of poorly researched techniques in somehow trustable printed ink. the fact that this treasonous act was still being performed on my royal jewels that long after should be evidence enough of her lack of prowess. there was a lot of squeezing and tugging, not things i would ordinarily associate with enjoyment in those regions. \n\nafter a little more than an hour total, the astrovan stopped for lunch. as did the other vehicles. it was a great but only temporary reprieve. sam had a pb&j sandwich and a laugh at my suffering. i don't remember having much of an appetite. \n\nnow let me remind you at this junction that we were on a mission trip, through our church, with my church's youth group. the mission trip was to last 5 days. we'd brought sleeping bags, pillows, and blankets so we'd be comfortable sleeping on the floor of a community center gymnasium. okay. got it? now let's continue. \n\nmy reprieve, as i stated before, was only temporary. when we were back on the road, sam and i flipped our places in the back of the van, presumably to give her other arm a rest. almost immediately, it began again. i pulled my hat over my eyes, faking sleep, but the rise and fall of my blanket in my lap proved my restlessness. some thirty minutes later, something happened. something that gave me reasonable cause to write in to cosmo's complaint department and file a full-fledged grievance. the basketball shorts i was wearing hardly provided barrier to my more \"protected\" assets. her hand, being slid up my shorts, was right there...some guys like fingers in their rectum, i get that, but that section of the article should've been prefaced with adequate prerequisite stipulations. 1) never in a van, 2) never while with your church group 3) never suddenly, aggressively, or 4) while wearing sharp gel nails. fuck, man. \n\nthis entire time, sam is very aware of my displeasure. i think he may of giggled, just then. \n\nfast forward five more minutes. sam, somehow still thoroughly entertained, in a merciful act of triage, gives her some much needed pointers. \"pointers\" of a completely different variety, if you catch my drift. i think he gestured to her the proper technique because suddenly things got a lot more focused in a great way. \n\nsuddenly, it become pleasurable. the pleasure grows. finally, in much the fashion you'd expect of someone in my situation, i was not far from relief. this is where i unintentionally manufactured my revenge on this penal penile perpetrator. i lifted the blanket off my crotch as i orgasmed, exposing my cock and creating an uncertainty as where the explosion would go. her reaction, perhaps also from lack of real-life experience, was to raise a shield to protect herself from what i can only guess she assumed would be enormous, and deadly. and actually, to my surprise as much as hers, it was. it absolutely devastated her shield. which was her pillow. the one that she would be sleeping on for the next five nights...\n\nshe made a sound then. not a grunt, or a scream. not a sound that has a name. for the sake of building it with your imagination, let's call it the \"someone jizzed everywhere\" sound. fleeting innocence, utter shock, sadness, fury, all boiled down into one cacophonous squeal. \n\nwe haven't spoken since. \n\n-------\n [OUT] ",

fucking intense and as vivid as real life. i have done it in the past, and try to avoid it at all costs. the last time i forgot to take it off for a nap, i woke up questioning reality on a major level. \n\nlast night's dream was crazy detailed, and seemed more real than anything i've ever experienced. i watched my cousin stab my other cousin in the chest, he's 7. i spent the rest of the time trying to get a refund for my ticket to disney world, and i was covered in blood, so it wasn't an easy task.\n\ni woke up sweating and jumping out of bed ready to go to the police or take some sort of action. took me about a minute to realize i had my patch on and i should just go back to sleep (which was almost as hard as getting my money back for the imaginary ticket).\n\ndidn't want to go into too much detail, but i still remember every second of the events of the dream, part of which i was getting shot at for being a terrorist in the middle east. didn't want to bore anyone, more than i already have.\n\n**edit request for longer dream explanation**: so aside from the whole disney world stabbing/refund experience (this was the end of my lengthy dream) i was also involved in a terrorist scheme.\n\ni found myself in a middle eastern country (unknown), and i was staying with some friends in a hotel/complex. it had a nice courtyard pool, the walls in the room were a bit aged, cracks showing exposed wires, wobbly ceiling fan overhead (3 blades in dire need of dusting), but over all a nice place considering the surrounding impoverished dwellings. \n\nafter getting settled into my room, i set out to explore the town. i can remember going down two flights of stairs and exiting the complex to a covered market square. the hustle and bustle of the shoppers was right out of national geographic. people trading and i remember overhearing an argument about the quality of the figs that day (in english of course). i make my way into a small indoor market, and i catch eyes with one of the most beautiful women i've ever seen. her skin was fair, and her green eyes pierced through me as i walked towards her. our gaze never broke as i passed by various shelves of fresh fruit and flowers. i could smell the aromas of each item i passed, but my attention never broke from the emerald eyes staring at me. \n\ni reached the counter and a soft voice asked me what i was looking for. i wasn't sure as i was a bit confused as to how i had reached this destination in the first place. i mentioned i was just browsing and broke eye contact for the first time in what felt like an eternity. when i brought my attention back to her she was holding a small furry mammal (i think a ferret, but i'm not 100% on this part). she said \"this is what you came here for. i know. i could tell when you walked in.\"\n\nwithout even thinking about price, i reach into my pocket and pull out a piece of paper and hand it to her. not money mind you, but a 4 fold piece of old paper. i remember it felt soft and weathered, like someone had been in tight possession of it for a long time. the trade went off without a hitch, and i put the animal down. it will follow me for the remainder of the experience. \n\nthere was a connection with this woman, the likes of which i've never felt. i could feel her presence, literally feel it when we were close. she knew i was not from around town and asked how long i would be staying. i said till friday (it was a monday in my dream). \"i'd better get going\" i stated. she smiled and asked me to come back again before i leave. \n\ni step out into the sun and a warm flash came over me. i got a phone call from my mom back in the states. she asked me if i was ready to board my plane. confusion set in as i was under the impression that i was in the fledgling stage of my journey. i reach into my pocket, shuffling through various scraps of paper and coins, i pull out my ticket and sure enough, my flight was scheduled for take off in a few hours.  i rush back to the hotel room where my friends (didn't know them specifically, but i know they were friends, if that makes sense). they're already packed and looked impatient. i throw all my clothes into a brown suitcase and slam it shut. there was a red and green shirt hanging out the side of the sloppily packed luggage. \n\nwe hop in a golf cart and were whisked away through the semi crowded market streets. i could feel small sand particles brushing my warming cheeks as the sun burned overhead. the airport hanger was a bit off. it looked like an underground top secret bunker entrance, complete with short concrete pylons and armed guards. i could feel something was amiss when my friends faces started to sink a bit upon seeing this.\n\n\"are you ready?\" my comrade queried. ready for what i thought. he gripped his luggage tight and let out a loud battle cry. the guards at the mouth of the bunker took stance with weapons drawn. the cart stopped and i fled, tripping over my parcel while exiting with much haste. the small animal that had been in tow kept pace with me as i could hear gun shots and the whistling of slugs screaming past my ears. i large explosion sent me to the ground. i could feel the heat push me off my feet, flying through the air, and landing in the dirt. the gritty taste lingered in my mouth as i pieced it all together. i was a terrorist. i had been on a mission, and backed out. \n\nthe last i remember of this part of the dream was closing my eyes in fear, and recalling the piercing green eyes, and comfortable connection i shared with the beauty behind the counter...i open my eyes to find i'm in disney world with my cousin...\n\n**edit 2:** i'm not much of a writer, so i hope that was at least slightly entertaining. i corrected some spelling and grammar.\n [OUT] ",

know to understand the context.\nsince i was a kid, i was into martial arts. kyokushin karate, to be exact. where i trained, it was actually mma based on karate. sparings were without protection (protective headgear, not condoms) and the hits were real. basically, only thing you couldn't do is hit somebody's head or balls. through years, i've fought in hundreds of sparings, both competitions and friendly fights with my comrades. \n\nin real life however, i avoid trouble. i've been into 2 \"real\" fights my whole life, both because drunk assholes didn't like my hair (i'm a long haired guy, but not feminine looking. i have full beard trimmed to 10mm and i'm ripped). although i could have probably fought those guys off, i never take risks, especially if somebody could get hurt, so i cheated with tear gas both times and nobody got injured. win-win.\n\nbeing attracted to guns, i also got licence as soon as i reached required age. i have respectable handgun collection and 3 family rifles. \n\nas i am naturally paranoid, i don't leave my home without 2 guns on me: usually hs xdm in .45 acp with 5.25in long barrel, custom trigger mechanism and crimson trace grip laser (it's a big sexy competition grade gun), which i carry under my shoulder, and 9mm baby glock at 6 o'clock as a backup. and of course 2 extra mags for xdm and 1 for baby glock.\n\nyou see, i love my guns very much. they even have names. if state found out the details of an accident i will describe here, they would probably take my guns. so please do not try to track me via clues i leave.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**prelude to the fuckup**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nsome time ago i got a job. due to global crisis, one certain company had to replace a lot of their workers with machines to maximize profit and save the company from bankruptcy, and needed somebody to program the machines. that's how i and team of other young engineers got our jobs.\n\nnow, if you were working most of your life for a certain company that replaces you with a kid fresh out of college, i am sure you would feel betrayed. former workers were protesting in front of the factory for couple of weeks, and some of them were even violent.\nmost of them were angry because company fucked them over, but some of them were angry because we (including myself) took their jobs. i understood somebody might want to hurt me or even my fiancee. but i was armed and ready for any trouble that might come.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n**the fuckup**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\none day this year, i was done working my afternoon shift. i took off somewhat earlier to enjoy rest of my birthday night. my fiancee was already on her job in the night shift, so i figured i would relax, watch some movies and drink hot chocolate while i wait for her to come back. \n\nit was dark, full moon shined between clouds onto wet road. amazing. after some time i have arrived in front of my building and got lucky with parking spot. everything is going better than expected. i enter the building, wait some time for the elevator, and finally chose my floor (pick a number between 10 and 20).\n\ni enter my flat. lights on, shoes off. unzip hoodie. music system on. my computer i use for storing data is constantly playing music from my rather rich library, and it stays always on for seeding torrents when i'm away (honor among pirates). then i looked through a window, to see this wonderful night from different perspective. from my floor i could see entire city, now more beautiful then ever. i turn off the lights and open the window to fully enjoy the moment. the song \"bloodflower\" is on. awesome timing, i really love that song. i felt gentle breeze touching my face. if only she was here, i thought. \n\ni was standing in front of my window for a while, hypnotized by beauty of the moment. out of the blue, i felt touch on both sides of my neck. the time seems to have slowed down. \nsomebody is here to hurt me. and maybe even hurt my fiancee. i will not let that happen. i can not. our lives now depend on my skill, strength and training. \n\nbut i am ready for this. the moment i felt touch on my neck, i turn around, with my right forearm sweeping assailant's arms away from my neck. after short glimpse, i saw attacker was wearing black hood over his head. my vision is almost perfect, but there was not enough light to see the face. but again i don't care about the face. this fucker is going down.\n\nit is time for counterattack. right after i have removed attackers arms from my neck with one swift sweep, i wrap my hands around attackers head and pull him, while rising my right knee up and taking off the ground with my left foot. my knee was supposed to hit attacker's chest, knocking him out of breath, but his arm was on the way (because of my previous sweep). doesn't matter, arm or no arm, this blow is very powerful. \n\nmy opponent is now breathless, i lower my knee after successful attack, jump half step back, rise high guard and launch quick left handed punch into attackers nose. this punch was more of distraction, because of my stance and short distance between my left fist and opponent's face i couldn't achieve a knockout speed. i jump back again, now pulling my trusty xdm from my shoulder holster under my hoodie, while attacker was disoriented and falling on his butt from my last punch. strange. that punch was not nearly enough to take adult male to the ground. doesn't matter. i aim my laser dot onto attackers head and growl with harsh and demonic voice: *\"move and i will blow your fucking head off\"*. being into black metal, i know how to make it sound convincing and really scary.\n\ni was dead serious with this \"i will blow your fucking head off\" part. my .45 acp gun was loaded with custom made +p+ hollow point rounds. round chambered, safety off (xdm has no thumb safety), firing pin in striking position and my finger on the trigger. if i had pulled it, it would have literally blown attacker's head off, or at least a big chunk of it. \n\nso far this is a win. home invader neutralized, i am not bleeding nor i have any broken bones. my fiancee is probably safe on her job.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nafter i shouted the part about blowing off the head, i heard attacker gasping for air and moaning. it was no guy. but again, i didn't feel boobs on my knee when i kicked the intruder. might be adrenaline, might be arm blocking. either way, hearing what sounded like girl moaning froze blood in my veins. swiftly but cautious, i move to turn on lights, with my gun still pointing at intruder's head.\n\ni will never forget what i saw next. a girl, as tall as me, sitting on the floor, gasping for air, moaning. her dark flowing hair covering her pale face, her both nostrils bleeding and her deep ocean blue eyes full of tears staring at my angry, bearded face. my hand cannon loaded with some very hot rounds pointing at her head, my finger still on the trigger, while sorrowful melodies quietly play in the background.\n\ni was frozen. the girl i love more than anything, the same girl i am ready to kill and die for, now sits on the floor, hurt by my own hand, because she tried to tickle my neck.\n\nwhen i have realized what i've done, i put my gun aside and jump to help her. knowing first aid very well, i knew what to look for and what to do. her right arm was deformed, but not bleeding. that's good. well, not good, but it could be worse. not priority. her nose is bleeding, but nothing serious. not priority. she is feeling chest pain and it's hard for her to breathe. not good. not good at all. i assumed i have broken her rib. priority. only thing i can do for her now is to kneel behind her, instruct her to use my body as support and call for help. after short call with emergency service, i started apologizing. i will never forgive myself for what i've done but hopefully she will. \n\nthere we were, both sitting on the floor. for first time in almost 20 years, 2 tears managed to escape from my cold eyes. i'm kissing her forehead, when she says: *\"it's ok, i'll be fine. you did a good job defending our home\"*, smiles and tries to chuckle but ends up coughing. \n\nmedics have arrived, i went to open the door. before i did so, i have noticed my gun is still on the floor. i quickly kick it under the couch and throw it's holster away. and no, it didn't go off, modern guns don't do that. if it did, cops (they usually escort er team if a victim was injured by somebody) would storm into my flat and it would be a fuckup of epic proportions, so sorry if you feel disappointed. anyway, i have opened the door to the medics, they took her to the hospital, and cops escorted me out under suspicion of domestic violence. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n**the aftermath**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\ni wasn't in contact with her for few hours because i had to explain the cops what happened. did they believe it? of course not. later they have told me i have broken her arm, nose, fractured 2 ribs. i've been held at police station for a while. she told her side of the story to psychiatrist for domestic violence. our stories matched perfectly, but again, beaten wives/fiancees/girlfriends are afraid of their husbands, so they lie for them. after hours of this bullshit they were finally convinced it was not intentional. good. i get to keep my guns and my freedom (damn that sounds american). my fiancee didn't even think about leaving me. happy ending after all, although i have missed birthday sex. shame. \n\nher christian parents were extremely pissed and told her *\"that's what you get for dating that satan worshiper\"* (well, all metalheads are satanists, are they not?). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nmy legal concern: pulling gun out in this situation was illegal, even if there was a real attacker. even though my fiancee will obviously not sue me for it, if state finds out i did that they will mark me as not suitable to own guns. and i don't want that. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nnow, for the \"special ones\", since i won't be returning to answer any questions you may ask: \n\nin case it was not obvious, her black hair looked like black hood to paranoid me in the dark, which blended with her black long sleeved shirt (she is kind of goth so she wears mostly black clothes). \n\nit all happened so fast there was no way i could tell \"the attacker\" was my actually fiancee. \n\nno, her body doesn't look like she is a guy, i only had a short glimpse at head before it was too late.\n\nentire event may seem to last long while reading this, but it happened in seconds. \n\nof course she didn't mention gun to the psychiatrist, she is not fucking retarded. \n\ncall of duty gun experts, the pistol really couldn't go off by getting kicked. xdm has both grip safety and trigger safety. unless i hold the grip and pull the trigger, firing pin is physically blocked and locked in place so it can not strike the cap. cap on the bullet was high quality and not old, so it couldn't self ignite either. but still, don't kick your guns unless you really have to.\n\ni have no idea why i have kicked it and quickly removed the holster, i could have simply holstered it back and have no problem with it. but hey, i panicked.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nfor any other questions, please ask other fellow redditors who have read the exact same story but have superior ability to draw conclusions and correct assumptions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\ndear readers, if you recently fucked up by

(see previous posts for info on the breakup and why this is bullshit)\n\ni sent t screenshots of conversations with my ex describing how t manipulated him into having sex when he did not plan on it, and how his attraction to t is akin to a crack addiction, as well as the explicit \"if t didn't fuck me, we'd still be together\" one. nothing in these posts related to the issues he supposedly broke up with me over.\n\nwell suffice to say t's surprised by this. it turns out that they did sleep together, after my ex told t that he was dumping me. my ex went and spoke to him about how unhappy he was with me, and that he feared my reaction if he dumped me. t told him he had to dump me because it would just eat away at my ex if he didn't. after concluding that he would dump me, my ex decided that he would reciprocate t's offer of having \"good sex\" (apparently not having t's 8\"+ dick made my ex resent me).\n\nwell now i realize something: my ex only slept with t so he could have an excuse to break up with me. he needed a scapegoat to blame for his actions because he thought it would be better than actually saying that he wanted to end it because he didn't want to be with me.\n\nturns out my ex is an even bigger fuckhead that i previously imagined, and had no problem trying to throw his friend under the bus to cover his own ass.\n\ni'm suddenly cool with t, and he wishes me best of luck in life (t still tried to blame me for everything, but i expected nothing else given his history of \"it's never my fault\" excuses).\n [OUT] ",

this is jim boeheim\"** \n\nstanding directly in front of jim, lebron shouted the obvious right back at me. if you know even a little bit about jim boeheim, you know he's an old grump at this point. his eyes squinted through his glasses, cheeks tense, bitchface completely not resting and says in complete disgust, \"what is this girl from connecticut?\"\n\n\"no, omg, jim, i can't belie- i'm a new yorker, i'm from newwww yoooorrrrk.\"\n\nhe quickly got in a cab and we went out separate ways. i spent the remainder of the day laughing my ass off, flipping through a mental slideshow of tyler ennis buzzer-beaters from that season, historic big east championships at the garden and of course, the recent chatter about uconn earning a spot in the final four just one year after former hc jim calhoun retired. this was just another great story from the weekend. \n\nbut it didn't end there. fast forward two days, and it's the monday of the national championship game. our seats for the first game were in the upper deck of at&t stadium, one of the most highlarious views for a basketball game. nonetheless, i was appreciative to even watch the game live, on the biggest television in the usa. we're walking to the stadium, pounding beers (there's no alcohol served in the stadium at the final four) hoping to catch a quick buzz for the game. i split from my colleagues and boss to get a quick souvenir while they go pick up the tickets at the stubhub box office.  upon meeting back up with them, i find out that our boss surprised us with seat upgrades on the floor. the only downside, we had to split our group of five. 2 tickets in the 10th row and 1 in the 15th went out to our guys, leaving myself and my boss with the final two tickets. my boss heads inside whilst us degenerate employees finish drinking. we finish, i take my ticket and head inside.  lebron mentioned that my ticket is for row a and that they might be the best seats since they're with the boss. \n\nrow 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, z, y, x, w, v, u, t, s, r, q, p......d, c, b, a. \n\ni'm pretty much losing it at this point, similar to the feeling of your face falling off on shrooms. i'm anxious, clammy and overwhelmed with excitement. i point my boss out of the crowd, front row, dead center. not a better seat in the house. after a few obnoxious excuse me's and pardon me's with complete tunnel vision, i sit down next to my boss in complete awe. remember, this was a surprise and i'm like a kid in a candy store. in rolls what evolves into fu #2 of the weekend.\n\nafter about 5-10 seconds of childish banter with my boss, i draw the attention of the people sitting next to us and lock eyes with... jim boeheim. everything in my mind goes to slow motion. i see jim, his wife and my boss in the three seats to my left, and turn right to see this giant jolly yet intimidating black dude named john thompson (hc of georgetown) and his wife. i literally keeled into myself. i get it, these are the famous coaches seats. wtf am i doing here?\n\njim knew. i knew. my boss knew and couldn't get enough of it.  \n\nshould i say something? who cares? no, don't bother him, he deserves to watch the game in peace.... just sit there and soak in this humiliation.\n\nwell, i spent a large part the game hammering away at burst photos on my iphone taking pics of the game trying to get a picture of drake who was sitting close by. to execute, i just threw my limb up in the air and held down the photo button for seconds at a time, i just couldn't get drake! \n\nlater that night, i'm scrolling through pictures and see that i've captured the cherry to my fu sundae. an image of jim, justifiably giving me yet the second resting bitchface of the weekend. even better is that at this point, its obvious what i'm trying to do and even drake's guy notices. \n\n[http://imgur.com/gknf5cl](http://imgur.com/gknf5cl)\n\noverall, the weekend was undoubtedly one of the best in my life. i'll forever be proud of single-handedly pissing off jim boeheim twice in one weekend. \n\nabout a month later, lebron got a chance to tell jim calhoun the story at some small high school in no good town, usa. he got a kick out of it.\n [OUT] ",

yesterday.\n\n\n i live in canada, it's the middle of february, and this was one of the coldest days of the year.  i was thinking to myself as i was walking home from class \"holy shit it's fucking cold, i should run the rest of the way\".  the wind was coming off the river and it just chilled you right to the bone.  just as i was about to take off, i see a raggedy looking dog in a driveway barking at everyone that passes. it did not have a leash on, there was no tags on it's collar, and i've seen it around the neighbourhood before roaming.  i went into the store next door because i know the owners pretty well and i tried to get some treats to lure the dog to me.  the owner said that he had already called animal control a couple times on the dog but nothing happened of it.  he gave me a couple cookies free of charge and said good luck.  i figured the dog might not be so inclined to come get them so i ran home real quick (half a block away) and grabbed a plate of my dog's wet food and his leash.  \n\n i get back to the house, and the dog is really scared and doesn't want to come get the food.  i tried to call animal control, but my phone was glitching out or my number was showing up as 'unknown' because as soon as i'd get connected to a person, the call would end. as i'm trying to lure the dog, other students are walking towards the school to their classes, and a girl stops and says how she also has called animal control on this dog.  she's seen it outside often too with no owners around.  as we're talking about this, a couple walking by (who live across the street from this place) also mentioned how they've called it in and how nobody is ever around for the dog.  so far that's 3 people who have called animal control minus myself.  they all wish me good luck getting this poor dog somewhere warm and go on their way.  it was at this point that i noticed the blood.  i saw a drop at first then i noticed more and more drops of blood.  probably about 10 spots in the snow covered driveway with decent size droplets of blood.  i'm super pissed so i bang on the front door to see if anyone's home.  nobody answers.  i bang on the window on the side of the house multiple times very hard and still, nobody comes.  at this point, the dog has ran into the backyard (gate wide open), so i decided to walk back and leave the dish of food for her.  it's the least i could do.  as i do that, the dog who is still scared of me, runs up onto the deck and disappears.  i thought that was strange so i peeked around the corner and the door to the house is wide open!  it's propped open by a bucket.  no screen door, like literally the house is exposed to the -25 degree weather, and the dog has nowhere to go to get warm.  i didn't know how long it was like this, but i know i've seen the dog out before as have other people, and no owners around.  so i decided to make the decision to call in the heavies.  i didn't know if someone broke into the house days ago and just left it, and the blood lead me to believe the dog was injured.  i yelled in the house a couple times that i'm calling the police just to make sure nobody was home again, and of course, there was no answer.  \n\ni called 911, and shortly after, a cop car showed up.  the officer was very friendly and understanding.  i told him what happened and he radioed in for someone to help him check it out.  5 minutes later, another cop shows up and they go inside to check it out.  they are in the house for maybe 5 minutes before a car pulls up on the street, stops in front of the house, and a guy leans out and asks what's going on.  now remember, i hate animal abusers, and i was pretty pissed off.  i asked if he lived there and he said yeah.  i said the dog is outside freezing it's ass off and bleeding, your back door is wide open, so i thought someone might have broken in and called them.  an older guy jumps out of the passenger seat and starts jogging into the house.  he tells me he owns the place on the way by and said it's his dog.  as he's inside with the police, buddy in the car says \"we were only gone 10 minutes\", to which i replied \"don't give me that shit man, i've been here for almost an hour now\".  we exchanged a few more words (he seemed pissed, i was pissed) and a couple minutes later the two cops and landlord of the house come out.  he tried to play it off saying he dropped is keys and \"one of the boys\" who rent the front unit of the house probably found them and dropped them off.  immediately, he asked where i lived.  i said it doesn't matter where i live and brushed it off.  again he asked where i lived and i just ignored him to talk to the cop and point out some of the blood spots on the driveway.  he asked again where i live and i said it doesn't matter, one of the cops chimed in and also said it doesn't matter.  this landlord guy was being super buddy-buddy with me at this point.  he thanked me quite a few times for calling the cops, patted me on the back etc.  he lightened up the situation, explained how the dog was in heat and that's why there was blood, and said no when the cops asked if he wanted to fill out a b&e report.  again, he was very buddy-buddy and asked one more time where i lived.  i was calming down, so i told him that i was just down the street.  we all shook hands and went on our way after i apologized for the misunderstanding.  i could see right through the guy, and i mentioned that to my girlfriend when i told her the story.  i thought he was too nice, his story was too perfect (and didn't explain why the door was propped open), and how he played it off that he 'lost' his keys. \n\n\nsitting in class after this, i felt like i was kind of a dick towards the guy in the car and decided i'd stop by the place on my way home to apologize for the confusion.  luckily i didn't do that...  it was too cold and i just wanted to get home.\n\nanyways, here's where i really found out i fucked up.  \n\nlater on in the evening, i was walking into the liquor store to get some beer for the night, when lo and behold, the landlord guy is walking out with a case of beer in hand.  i figured i'd just ask him to apologize to the guy who was in the car for me because i felt like kind of a dick.  before i could even say anything he angrily says \"you shouldn't have called the fucking cops man\", to which i say that his door was wide open and dog was bleeding.  he said i should've knocked, to which i said i did numerous times.  he said that i have no idea what he has in that house and that he is completely fucked now.  he said he's going away for a long time and it's all my fault.  he must have said i shouldn't have called the cops 10 times and stressed very much how completely fucked he thinks he is and how it's my fault. i tried to say that the cops just left and nothing happened, but he said that he is done now and i shouldn't have called them. this guy was livid and just turned and walked away pissed off when i was mid sentence.  i concluded that they way he was saying it, we aren't just talking about a couple weed plants here.  he seemed like, whatever he has in that house, was definitely found by the police and he's going to jail for life.  \n\n\n my suspicions of him 'playing it off' with the cops were confirmed, only that i was wrong about it being about the animal abuse and was about him having some serious 'heat' in the house.  i was scared for my life, my 6 months pregnant girlfriend's life, and my dogs life.  in my mind, this guy has nothing to lose, he's drinking, and he made sure he knew where i lived.  i contacted a friend of mine who is a police officer and filled him in but my friend basically said there's not much i can do short of having my phone ready to call 911 if the guy tries anything.  he didn't make an explicit threat, although he did everything but.  \n\nluckily we made it through last night with nothing happening, but i still feel like there is a huge target on my back and i have no funds to move or temporarily stay somewhere.  all i wanted to do was make sure the dog had a bite to eat and somewhere warm to go, but i ended up getting myself involved in some serious shit.\n [OUT] ",

perhaps i toss this bat towards the ball i just woefully under-hit, to knock it off course and complete my original plan to sprint my way to  a homerun. \n\nthe second i have this idea, my arm puts it into action, i toss the bat expertly towards the ball to knock it ever so slightly off course. only i don’t toss the bat. with an accidental flick of the wrist i turn that bat into a plastic missile that’s heading right for the ball. right for where hank is currently lunging. right for his nose. literally, square on the bridge of  his nose. \n\nthe rest is a bit of a blur, there’s shouting, hank falls down. chaperones rush to his aid. children scream at me for being the bat-happy maniac with a temper that i seem to be. the opposite of glory.  hank was attended to by an emt that came to stop his nose from bleeding, and luckily it was just a minor break. i spent the rest of a night wallowing in the corner of the room, wishing i didn’t exist, or have such poor in-the-moment judgment. i felt terrible for hurting a kid i thought i was becoming friends with. and getting middle school off to such an awful start, was a poor consolation. like icarus i flew too high with my dreams and plummeted to my doom. \n\nthat september, i walked into my homeroom class only to find hank sitting directly behind me. my heart dropped, i knew my reputation as a bandit-bat-basher would follow me to my grave. instead, he cracks a joke about it. i ended up sharing classes, laughs and some of the best memories of my life with that kid for the next 6 years (throughout middle school and high school). to this day he’s one of my best friends, (and he still has a bump on the bridge of his nose (from yours truly).\n [OUT] ",

what the actual fuck!?\". \n\nshortly after receiving that text message, my friend followed up with her own. she said she needed time to think, and to never contact her friends again. after staring at my phone in disbelief for a good 20 minutes, i sent an apology message, of which i'm sure didn't really do anything, and promised i wouldn't contact her again.\n\nfun fact, i couldn't remember the last time that i had cried. well, that ended shortly after those messages because i just couldn't handle it. i could not believe that i had fucked up so badly.\n\nso, in the period of a couple of hours, i had managed to be a huge creep, ruin a great friendship that i valued, and make a whole lot of people fucking hate my guts. i honestly still don't really know how to deal with it. i've had trouble concentrating on my work, trouble studying for my final exams, and i can barely sleep at night. reddit, this is probably one of my biggest fuck ups to date. my anxiety is back, and i think the depression is following.\n\ni've pretty much decided that it ain't worth putting myself out there for the short remainder of my college experience. i think i will just return to my old habits and be a hermit. after one more semester i will hopefully be graduated.\n\nthanks for taking the time to read about my huge fuck up.\n [OUT] ",

(name changed)” he practically shouted back as he found me a seat and handed me the official application to be filled out and attached to my resume.\n\nif there had ever been a need to find a poster boy for the douchebags of america, pat would’ve been my nomination for the leading candidate, and would have my full support. mind you, this was several years before the debut of “jersey shore” and the mass population of ed hardy clothing, so my opinion on that subject has since changed.\n\nthe simplest function of his job was to keep the potential applicants entertained as they waited and he provided them with mindless small talk in a “cool” and “hip” tone that could pass as what he viewed to be relatable to the teens and twenty-somethings they were expecting to respond to their calls, all the while masking the fact that he was actually an unimaginative and shallow 30-something moron who’d more than likely run his life into the ground and was using this job as his last resort to make money for his bud light and whore habit. as i filled out my application and listened to him strike up conversation, it became very evident to all of us in the room that he was extremely good at what he did, something that was overly apparent as he wove a complex tapestry of bullshit, an art he’d not only mastered, but had gotten a professional grant to pursue.\n\npat informed me that there were so many of us because there were actually going to be two interviews. first, we’d individually go in and have a one-on-one interview and then, after the weak were pulled from the herd, three or four survivors would then stay to part take in a 90 minute group interview and demonstration of the company’s primary product.\n\ni quickly thought to myself, “wait, product? what product? i thought this was a computer tech support job.” this all sounded very strange to me and, in between trying to out-bullshit pat, suddenly i began to realize that maybe this was not the same company that i had thought it was, but was in fact…\n\n“next up?” i heard, as a female voice interrupted my thought process. i quickly turned around to meet the voice and resp… holy shit!\n\nstanding in the doorway, there stood one of the most perfect female specimens i’ve ever seen up close. this girl was stunning. she had the full package: absolutely gorgeous hazel eyes, full pouting lips, tan skin, a mini skirt that barely covered her athletic thighs that rested just below her low cut blouse that was just barely containing her d cup bust and, being that she appeared to be in her early 20’s, gravity had not yet become her enemy.\n\n“yuh… hi....” i stuttered in reply as i stood up, and shook her hand.\n\n“hi, i’m gianna. (name changed) thanks for coming! i’d like to bring you in for your one-on-one now.” she said as she giggled, oblivious to the fact that i had just been caught off guard.\n\ni went into her office as she closed the door behind me and instructed me to take a seat, and the only thing i could think about was how much i wanted to have hers.\n\nnow, keep in mind, below any shred of confidence i may present as a human being, i am one of the most socially awkward people i know, and was especially so at age 20. when i get embarrassed, my face turns the shade of an apple and my sweat glands open up like niagra falls. so, needless to say, by this point, my face was beginning to get red and i was starting to break a sweat.\n\nas gianna sat down to review my resume and application, she took off the jacket she was wearing, leaving only her incredibly low cut blouse and leaned over the desk to read. i did everything in my power at this point to look at her eyes and not end up pitching a tent. i must’ve thought about more baseball in the 10 minutes i spent in that office than i have in my entire life.\n\nthe office itself had little open spots in the ceiling that divided it from the lobby, so if anyone out there were listening hard enough, they'd be able to hear tidbits of what was going on. \n\nthe next part got a little weird. when we started to talk, she actually seemed to be flirting with me! i couldn’t believe it. between everything the two of us would say, she’d giggle at me, over-emphasize her “m’s” which i found to be so sexy, and at one point i even thought i caught her looking at my crotch. i had to continually stop myself and say, “brain, stop fooling yourself. this girl is far out of your league. you don’t have that kind of game. you are not that suave. abort.”\n\ni continued to try and remain as professional and calm as possible, answering all of her questions to the best of my ability, peppering every response with the corny and horribly bad humor that i seem to have trademarked up to this point. yet still, every single time i say something, she giggles and seems to be flirty. at this point, i’m confused, but i’m also terrified because this is not someone who i’m able to act on flirtation with, especially if i’m in desperate need of a job.\n\nit was around this time that she informed me that i was actually sitting in the office of a company that hires people to sell products door to door. this was not the company i thought it was at all. distracted, i wondered for a second how the hell these people had gotten my phone number, but didn’t care, because i was currently entranced by the situation.\n\nat some point during the conversation, guy logic kicked in and my brain decided, “fuck it. you’re not going to take a job as a door-to-door salesman. you might as well milk this for all it’s worth, get this girl’s number, and maybe something will come of it.” so, rather than cut her off and politely say i wasn’t interested, i decided to let her talk me into staying for the 90-minute group interview. what the hell was i doing? i didn’t want to do this at all. i mean, really?\n\nthe one-on-one “interview” concluded by her saying, “well, congratulations! let’s go out there and meet some of your potential new crew!”\n\nas we got up to walk toward the door, she stopped me before opening it and got kind of awkward for a moment and looked at me. she then proceeded to utter the most horrifying words a guy can hear: “oh, um… there’s something i’ve been meaning to tell you. i didn’t want to say anything in front of everyone before, but um… your fly is open.”\n\nshit. that was it. that was why she kept giggling, that was why she kept looking at my crotch and that’s why she kept doing whatever my dumb ass interpreted as flirting. guy logic, damn you!\n\nnormally, that would be enough embarrassment and blow to my ego for one solid week, but what happened next couldn’t have been more perfectly timed, and it was due to the very comical placement of several different factors…\n\nnow remember, i get red and sweaty easily when i feel humiliated, so at this point you should realize that any shred of confidence i had was immediately tossed away and i was quickly becoming more red and sweaty than rob reiner trying to walk a flight of steps.\n\njust before she decided to open the door, gianna sneazed. it was a pretty rough sneeze and it caused her to tear up quite a bit and her face to get a bit messy. naturally, this prompted her to grab a tissue. at this point, she opened the door, and neither of us really could’ve predicted how it looked.\n\nas the door opened, i immediately locked eyes with the teenager sitting directly across from it who saw me zip up my fly as we both came into his view, who then proceeded to look at gianna wiping off her teary and slightly snot-covered face with a tissue, then looked back at me, saw how red and sweaty i was, jumped up and screamed, “oh! dude! you got the job! you got the job! oh my god! you are the man! can i have my interview next!?”\n\nin retrospect, it looked really bad, as did the nervous explaination from the both of us to the rest of the people sitting out in the lobby that she was not, in fact, just doing what it looked like.\n\nneedless to say, i didn’t stay for the 90 minute group interview. i also didn’t get her number, or the hour and a half of my life that this process took back.\n [OUT] ",

(a and b’s neighbors had moved in less than a week ago, so none of us had met them.) we snuck across their yard and set the folded up letters on their porch. i think there were about four of them. we went back to their house and minded our own business, giggling at our funny prank. afterwards, we went to the mall together.\n\nwhen i got home, my dad called me into his room. i wen tin and he told me to sit down. he asked what i had done with a and b that day. i instantly knew that i was in trouble and i could feel my face turned red, but 12-year-old me (trying to hide it) told him that we didn’t do anything. he asked if i was sure and, knowing that my cover was blown, pretended i just remembered that we pulled a prank. he made me describe in what we did, my face only getting redder by the minute. he then told me what had happened while a, b, and i were at the mall. \n\napparently, the neighbors read the letters we wrote and thought they looked suspicious and creepy. (read: not a prank) they took pictures and posted it on facebook, where a friend commented that it looked like blood and they should go to the police. they called the police and had it tested or something, and it turned out that it wasn’t blood, but some cheap red ink. i can’t remember how my dad got the news, but as he told me i just broke down and started crying. thinking back this was probably the most trouble i had ever been in at the time. my dad told me that a and b had to apologize in person and i would as well tomorrow, but i refused and instead decided to write them a letter. i wrote three sentences apologizing for the prank, and then below that i wrote out a long paragraph on how they completely ruined my day and how stupid it was that their facebook friend thought the ink was blood. my dad cut that part off before he delivered it, so they never got my violent threat to send my eight month old kitten after them if they ever pulled this kind of crap again. i wrote the apology in blue ink because i thought i was so smart. \nanyway, that was my story of how a stupid prank escalated to calling the police.\n [OUT] ",

jessie is awesome! really laid back, genuinely chill person. so i really wanted to show her a good time. unfortunately, when you're on a family vacation, it's just a bit harder to have fun in the traditional teenage sense. \n\nthe first night, we just ended up laying in my bed watching netflix. i had some vodka to drink & i offered her some alcohol too, but she denied. she said not only three days ago she got so shitfaced her current boy of interest had to carry her home in the middle of the night. i totally understood, and didn't want to push it. i ended up throwing up that night, but she was already asleep. we laughed about it the next morning. \n\nthat day, i really wanted to show her that i wasnt okay with just sitting around & tanning. it was quite boring. so i opened up my good friend tinder, & we looked for beach parties. & then, we found daniel. daniel was, ironically, going to the other campus that i mentioned before. right swipe! & we matched! pretty soon, jessie, daniel & i had a plan to go out to dinner. i was bringing vodka, he went out and bought us our drinks of choice, & he had a car. we all met up on the beach, & pretty soon started hammering down drinks. especially me. daniel had a few beers, but jessie wasn't drinking anything. i felt so bad... i asked if she wanted anything, but she kept saying \"someone needs to drive!\".... i guess she was right, but i kept asking her if she was having fun, & she kept insisting that she was. okay. \n\nexit the beach. we're on our way to dinner. i have already thrown up several times. people at the restaurant cleary can tell i've had too much to drink. i asked jessie to escort me to the bathroom about 8 times, & on our way out, i threw up in front of everyone & ran into about three sets of doors. \n\nat this point, daniel & jessie are just trying to get me to sober up. i had way more to drink than i had thought, so they took me to the pier. i don't remember this at all, but apparently i face planted about 6 times and attracted a lot of attention. when i regained consciousness, we all decided to go back to my beach house & stay outside & swim. everything was fine, until daniel & i got into the hottub but ourselves. jessie was still in the main pool, minding her own business. i'm not quite too sure how this happened, but i was on top of daniel, we were making out heavily. \n\n& then my mother comes outside. \n\n\"madeleine... what are you doing...?\" \n\ni was still too inebriated to really comprehend what had happened, so i confidently responded \n\n\"were just kissing, mom\" \n\nmother then proceeded to tell daniel it was time to leave. i have never seen a boy run so fast in my life. like, seriously, kid ran like there was a stampede of rabid zebras behind him. \n\njessie was over in the main pool laughing to herself. she went upstairs, & i was left by myself to dry off. when i went upstairs, my whole family was talking about how \"drunk madeleine has already made a fool of herself in front of her roommate by hooking up with some random guy\"... i apologized profusely, & then told them all i was going upstairs to shower. i needed to clear my head. \n\ni get into the bathroom, & let the shower run for a bit. i called my friend to tell him everything that happened, & if he had any advice. while i was on the phone, steam from the shower was building up on the floor, making it slippery. in a quasi drunken state, i slip & fall. \n\n\"are you ok?\"\n\ni hear over the phone. i knew i broke my collarbone. i've done it before. so i picked up the phone & simply said \n\n\"i broke my collarbone\" \n\n\"no you didn't. you'd be crying. just ice it.\"\n\ni hung up & turned off the shower. i made my way downstairs & announced to the family that i had just broken my collarbone. jessie laughed & said \"is that what that huge bang was?\", i swear, if i didn't look like a fool before, for shit i did now. \n\nthey all looked at me like i was crazy. my mom told me to sleep it off on the couch downstairs. in the morning, my dad had a long talk with me about how much i had fucked up. jessie was still asleep, so i asked my dad to take me to the hospital. i was still sure my collarbone was broken. nobody believed me. we got it x rayed. what a surprise. it's broken. we get home, & jessie was ready to leave. she was supposed to stay another day. can't say i blame her.\n [OUT] ",

everyone in there thinks if we want to talk in skype with webcam we're just looking for dirty talk and virtual sex, and she wasn't afraid of that! she was totally okay. i was with some clothes i just use inside my house, some scraps here and there, my hair(it's big) was all messed up and i have a dumb face so i wasn't too comfortable in the beginning.\n\n\nshe helped me a lot and we talked more and more. we exchanged photos a lot, she shows me her draws, we exchange talks and experience in skype and now in whatsapp. since no one talked with me like she did from the site and helped me, i always said thanks to her, said that she was so nice/kind for doing that, she was so amazing and that i love her from taking her time to help me.\n\n\nshe says i'm cute and she's happy helping me and making me happy, we start to talk with each other every day, she tells me her histories of life that she would never tell to anyone, so i know i'm a trusted guy, we exchange more photos, cute texts and thanks each other.\n\n\nwe were doing this so much that i start to think we'll live forever together and meet someday. she never said she'll live with me, she never said we could be together, she just replied what i've said about it, but she didn't said a no.\n\n\ni never believed being in a relationship with people from internet, for me it was something that would never happen since i love hugs, i love kisses, i love have dates and walk holding hands, watch movies in the couch under the blankets, those things, so i never thought i'd have a distance relationship because i'd be upset since i couldn't do those things. buuuuut.\n\n\ni was really thinking she was into and i know i was into her, a beautiful girl helping me feel great, helping me feel happy, saying cute things, sometimes sending me photos(not nudes) and sharing things that she would never tell anyone. well, she was being a friend and nothing more! well the thing that made me think of her not like a friend but like we were in love was our cute flirts and talks, why she would say she loves me(even learn it in my native language), with tons of hearts, help me a lot and just wanted to be a friend?\n\n\nthere's some pics of her being nice, but these aren't the ones that made me think we loved each other, just to show how she was nice:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nvtqhww.png : 1st\nhttp://i.imgur.com/juiumc4.png : 2nd\n\n\nthere was lots of messages like these, but with lots of hearts, lots of love you and thanks, lots of you're cute, someday after some struggle i said i was in love with her(well, i didn't said, i kinda said i was in love with a girl and said the characteristics of her but she got it was her), days passed and we were talking normally, i felt i was annoying her or something like that with all of that, but she said it was okay and she liked it since it makes her feel flattered.\n\n\nwe were talking normally, i've just woke up and we we're saying hi etc, she send me a photo and asked how was her hair, i said \"it's beautiful\" if i remember everything well, and she say \"thanks\" then i say \"your hair is amazing\" because she knows i like her hair and knows i think she's awesome, that's where i know i'm fucked up. she answers with this:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kk0bfbz.png\n\n\n\"my boyfriend forced me to take of all..\" well i guess that you don't need to know the entire message isn't? did you read there? she has a boyfriend, all this time flirting, talking like boyfriend and girlfriend and she never said she had another boyfriend, i froze. \n\n\nmy heart started to pound like some bouncy ball when you throw hard inside some small place and it bounces like crazy. i didn't knew what to do, all my plans, i really, really believed we would be together forever, i really felt we were something, she was one of the small group of people that actually made me happy with only words, she could manipulate me like she wanted with her power of goddess but she said that.\n\n\nshe explained complementing a history she told me some days before that, her actual boyfriend helped her a lot and that's why they're together, he helped her like she did with me and she said that she thought i knew she had a boyfriend from her skype photo hugging a guy that actually was her bf(and i thought it was only a friend).\n\n\nafter she explaining it and everything, we tried to talk like before, but it didn't seemed the same thing, i didn't wanted to say i love you to her knowing there's other guy with her there, she started to answer with common answers, i think she felt bad for me than that's why she didn't wanted to talk again(she could've said sorry, i don't know .-.), but with time we stopped talking with each other until we never talked again. and i've lost her, the only girl that really shown me that there's still someone that would make me feel happy out there, i don't believe in angels but i like to say she was an angel to me. i'll never forget this girl that by coincidence have this nickname(or almost it): \"don'tforgetme\"\n\n\nif she said that to get rid of me, i don't know. but i learned a lot with this experience.\n\n\nafter this large text at least i know i have some history to write a book.\n [OUT] ",

some unlocked window or terrace door... no luck. i ring every doorbell, no one answered (i later found out that only one of the doorbells worked). they live next to a kiosk with slot machines, so i go in there to ask if the owner by any chance has the key to the main entrance, as he's right next door. in order to go in, the owner had to open two doors with a key to let me in - he locks both of them again once i had entered. the place seemed a bit weird, there were only the owner and two other guys in there, all foreigners smoking cigarettes and gambling, looking at me with really unwelcoming looks. i started explaining the owner my situation, but he pretty much ignored me and kept asking me questions about whether or not i was from the police in really bad english. after trying to explain and heed for help for about 5 minutes, i gave up and spent the next 2 minutes getting him to unlock the doors for me, so i could get out. \n\nonce out, i give up and call their parents (about 15 minutes have passed here since i locked myself out). that's when i realized, that the reason my girlfriend hadn't responded, was due to my phone suddenly seizing to function. it responded to touch, but couldn't connect to anything requiring internet nor send or receive texts and calls. i panicked and threw small rocks on the windows of the other floors, not getting any reactions at all - nobody was home. not knowing what to do, i took out my credit card, thinking that maybe, just maybe, i could be like one of those guys in movies who could open a locked door with a credit card. while attempting to slide open the door with the card, i gave it a few bumps with my hip to push open the door. crack. i had smashed the glass in the door. at least now, i could stick my hand in through the hole in the glass and unlock the door from within. i got in, checked on the kids (they were still sleeping, hadn't noticed a thing) and cleaned up the pieces of glass on the floor in the main entrance. in my embarrassment, i decided that i wouldn't tell them what really happened and spent the time remaining before they got home, thinking of what to tell them. \n\ntheir mom came in first, telling me that the dad was withdrawing some money and would be up with my payment in a moment. i told her, that i had heard a loud crash-noice earlier from the main entrance, so i had walked out to see a young guy (i said he was probably 14-15 as i didn't want to scare her) trying to break in. being the hero that i am, i ran after him, but wasn't able to catch him. when returning to the main entrance door, i found out that it was locked, but as the young guy had already broken the glass, i just gently pushed out some of it and locked myself in and cleaned up the mess. she was dumbfounded and told me a different story. a few months ago, someone had walked through their garden to jump the fence into the backyard of the supermarket next door to steal some of their wares. due to this, they had surveillance cameras installed over the entrance, so they could catch them, were it to happen again. i did not see that one coming. cold sweat was running down my neck and back, and i tried my hardest to figure a way out of this. that's when the dad came in, giving me a smile and handing me my payment. the mom told me to tell him what happened and not knowing what else to do, i told him the exact same thing. he told me the same thing about the surveillance cameras. while putting on my shoes and jacket, the dad did the same. i nervously ask him where he's going, to which he answers that he's going to check on the surveillance tape. finally running out of options, i tell them what happened. i've never seen confusion, disbelief and disappointment so clear in someones face. i apologized many, many, many times and offered to pay for the glass and give back my payment, to which they declined. i thanked them, said goodbye and left. i've never felt so embarrassed, as when i wrote my bike home that evening. i never even got to smoke that cigarette.\n\nto my surprise, they have actually had me babysit their kids after this evening, even joking about what i did. they are bigger people than i am.\n [OUT] ",

synthetic marijuana. what do i know about it? i saw a youtube video once. what does she know about it? she's a damn encyclopedia. trying to steer the conversation away from synthetic marijuana backfires. now she's discussing why it's \"bullshit that heroin is illegal.\" heroin. not weed. not shrooms. heroin. smack. junk. heroin. \n\nwe arrive at cheddar's. i'm decently dressed and she looks like she's there to rob the joint. the urge to take off running, and come back for my car later was unreal. every footfall across the parking lot towards the restaurant was as loud as a thunder clap. this is going to be bad. i do the gentleman thing and hold the door open for her. as i walk through i catch a barely concealed \"yikes!\" look on the face of the receptionist. shame washes over me as i realize... they know. i've been catfished and it would only be more obvious if i was going around shaking hands and announcing it. \n\nthe waiter takes our drink orders barely holding down a laugh like jimmy fallon during his snl years. she orders first, \"a blue motherfucker please.\" \"uh you mean a blue hawaiian?\" he asks. \"same thing,\" she replies. \"water with lemon,\" i insert as i contemplate pulling my shirt up over my head to hide my face. \n\nby this point i feel like the main character in poe's the tell-tale heart. the passing staff aren't being obvious with their glances, but my senses are so acute that i notice them. i just want to scream and pull up the floor boards exposing my pof account to everyone there. as we leave cheddar's the outside air is so freeing compared to the stagnant air of that forsaken booth that i unintentionally, audibly sigh. she notices, but says nothing.\n\nthe ride back is mostly silent. the conversation never fully recovered from her dinner tirade about posting naked pictures of the girl her ex cheated on her with to the girl's facebook profile. i'm glad to be out on the road heading back, but in the back of my mind i know there's still one final act to survive. \n\nwe're back on bigotry lane approaching the house. i know she's going to try something. she's been smiling at me all night with that \"i'm gonna kiss me a man tonight\" look. through sheer tyranny of will she has ignored what i felt were flagrant social cues expressing my dis-interest. i come to a stop in the driveway. my internal alarms are going off like a nuclear plant with a superheated steam leak. i tell her \"it's been fun\" and she leans in for the kill. i extend my hand, and we very awkwardly, almost to the point of physical pain, dap it up. she's got the message. she gets out, but as she's crossing in front of my car she eats it. she eats it hard. i've seen skateboarding fail videos on youtube that she's just put to shame by hitting the dirt like there was a sniper in the trees across the road. \"faaaaaaaaahck,\" i sigh as i reach for the door handle. \n\n\"are you okay?!\" i'm half bewildered by the newtons she put down in the fall, and beside myself with the punishing urge to lose my shit laughing. she's trying to get up, but she's not doing well. so i help her up off the dirt driveway. she thanks me and opens her arms for a hug before i leave. i assume no foul play, so i concede a hug. except something is not right. her lips are fully puckered, and she's cutting my face off from clearing the side of her head. oh my god. deftly, i raise my chin, and stop. she has kissed me dead center on the chin. i noticed her eyes were looking at me as i closed mine in defeat. it was only a half second, but it felt like a lifetime. i didn't acknowledge it, i just turned and got back in my car and left. i drove home in total silence. music off. windows up. just a man and his shame on the open road. i will never return to that cheddar's for the rest of my life.\n [OUT] ",

(i think that he's just gotten used to me messing up badly. like my mathematics grades. i always get less than 20% of the total marks. i know, i'm just really bad at it.) my brother isn't home yet. also, i just realised my art exam is tomorrow, and all my concept stuff, references and additional work are on it... i can't contact my tuition teacher for any help for next week's tests, and notes i made on my literature book, which i need to study for the literature exam tomorrow as well are also on it. as if my luck couldn't get worse.\n\nedit 2: it got worse. woke up with a fever, 38.6°c. had a pulsing headache and shivered the whole day. didn't have enough energy to get up. went to the doctor's just now, got 2 days off school. and i had finished my preparatory work for art too... all gone to waste... i don't know if i can make it to tomorrow's exam, i feel like shit and can't really think properly. i've been sleeping the whole day. oh well, time to go back to sleep...\n [OUT] ",

(remember the ‘van der’ part.) this friend was just as interested in this stuff as i was, so we spend a lot of time on the school computers together. \nat the same time i found a way to access my home computer which i was locked out of as punishment for my poor grades. it had mac os 9 installed. i didn’t have the password and my parents changed it frequently to prevent me from trying to try and guess it. at that time i found out there was something called a keylogger. i installed this, but i only had access to the logfile when my parents gave me access, which wasn’t very often, but they were often away for work. so i used the recovery disk to gain access to the files. worked for years, i felt good. i only told my parents how i did it when i moved out.\n\nthis keylogger sounded like a good idea at school too. since we could now create startup items through word, we could install the keylogger. however, as it turned out the app would only started logging after you logged in to the oracle system. damn. some time passed when eventually my friend said he had found a way to make the keylogger start before the oracle tool. he had made some sort of script, which we could run that would automatically install everything where we needed it. we struck gold. we didn’t realize it at the time, but we had found a way to gain access to everyone’s password.\n\nat this time we decided to be a little smarter about it all. so we started using the login details of other people to do our work. that way we wouldn’t show up in logfiles anymore. we continiously changed the login details we used to throw anyone possible following us off our trail. it was going well, but because all the it guys and teachers had their own computers we only had access to the accounts of other students. we didn’t feel like screwing up other people’s accounts and documents so we soon got bored with the entire thing. at which point we came up with the idea to act as though our computer wasn’t working, in order for the it guy to come and fix the issue which pretty much always meant they would login, say everything was okay and they would move on with their day. but at that point we had their login details. turned out they didn’t have much valuables in their accounts either.\n\nso we kept thinking about ways to get more passwords. we were very happy with ourselves, we felt like hacking spies. so we decided to break into the teacher’s room. there were the computers only teachers used. there we were, 13/14 year old boys, stealing and copying keys from teachers, mirrors to look around corners. usb sticks that would install files. code words. we felt so cool. a few weeks later we went back and retrieved all the logfiles containing the access details from most teachers. we dug through all their private conversations, looking for their passwords….\n\nand then it happened. we stumbled upon the login details for the head of it. i can’t remember his name, but i’ll never forget his password; ‘thetearshaverisentoaflood’. at first we even missed it, thinking it was some random text, because it’s such a long password. but there it was. the key to the school if you like. it gave acces to everything. e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. i seriously felt my fingers tingled when i first pressed enter and the account opened.\nwhen it rains it pours. all the data we had collected made it so that we could now do almost everything. we could login as teachers and change grades. we could login as the dean and change school schedueles. at some point we even created a new student and gave him everything a normal student would have. when names were called in class to check if everybody was present his name was actually called. i still use this name for all my fake accounts, it feels like my alter ego.\nyes,we felt like we owned the school.\n\n\nearly on we decided to never use this “power” to change anything to our benefit. we never changed our grades or stole tests we had to do ourselves for example. we did all this stuff as we were more or less curious about what we could do, not to cheat our way through school. we changed grades of fellow students a few tenths upwards for example (in the netherlands we grade from 0-10) and then checked in class if the grade was actually awarded. we also never took money for anything. it was offered, but we never took anything. i’m not saying what we did was right, but we did do it with at least some sort of integrity.\n\nthings started to unraffel not much later. we were 13/14 year old boys, we had all this power. obviously we weren’t able to keep it quiet. our friends knew, their friends probably knew. at some point we put tests on a floppy drive and gave them to people we knew in classes higher up. it went sort of viral. soon everybody knew the test was out already. after all was said and done it was estimated that 95% of the people taking the test had seen the test beforehand.\n\n\nwe didn’t know this was all happening at that time. we were sort of basking in our glory and i’m pretty sure we got careless. we sat down at any computer and would simply login as the head it guy and did our thing. were we once all nervous, now we went in like we owned the place. then again, we sort of did. we didn’t suspect anything going wrong.\n\n\nthen came the call. we had a sort of intercom phonesystem in class and it rang. our teacher picked up the phone and only a few seconds in she started looking at me. i felt my heart sink even though she hadn’t yet said a word. i’d been caught doing stuff i wasn’t supposed to enough times to know what how people look when they catch you.\nshe hung up the phone and she said that herp van derp and me had to go to the head of it. i knew we were done, this guy never talks to students and now we were summoned to his office.\n\nwe came into his office. he was there with his assistant. placed us on small seats and started his interrogation. it really was an interrogation. he started with me, accusing me and intimidating me. telling me that we had done thousands worth of damage. that we’d be going to prison and what not. but it soon became clear to me that he wanted me to confess, so i figured he didn’t have any proof yet. remember, i had been king of the hill for months at that time and i had pulled so much other shit before that, that i wasn’t that easily scared by people who were angry with me. so i started to relax, smile and let this guy build up his rage. and it built up. his face red, his voice raised. but i wasn’t going to budge, so he turned to herp van derp and he exploded. \nremember how i said to remember the name of my friend who helped? well his name was ‘herp van der derp’. this classmate is called ‘herp van derp’. a tiny difference in the name, but a total difference in person. herp van der derp was like me. herp van derp was a friendly, shy guy who had never done anything wrong in his live. he had never been yelled at in his live so he caved, immediately. started crying that he didn’t know what this was about, which was true, but only i knew that. so the it guy upped his game and stands up and starts yelling in his face that his future is done. he will never get into any school again, he will personally make sure of that unless we tell him what we did. i wasn’t going to, and herp van derp couldn’t because he had no idea what all of this was about. not that he was able to explain that very well, he was crying too hard.\n\nthe assistent was starting to feel sorry for herp van derp so he wanted to show us the evidence of what they accused us of, in order to force us to speak up. both the head of it and the assistent looked at the computer and the face of the head of it who had been screaming and threatening us turned all white. “herp van der derp, that’s you right?” he asked. at that time herp van derp had been turned into a mushy ball of snot and tears and he mumbled and snickered. “no, i’m herp van derp.” without any further ado he was sent back to class and was asked to send herp van der derp. herp van der derp was just like me, so he came in, we grinned at eachother and just sat back to take in all the verbal abuse.\nthe evidence they had? it turned out to be extremely thin. they had tracked back who had installed all the keyloggers. these accounts were never ours, but all the way in the beginning we had logged out and only a few seconds afterwards we had logged in. that was all they had, but combined with the rumours floating around that we had something to do with it, they figured they could pressure us into confessing.\n\nit was years later when i realized that they probably pressured us so much because at that point nobody else knew of this breach yet. they wanted to avoid having to tell the school that a couple of 13/14 year olds had breached their entire system. especially since it was done so simple.\n\nweeks later my parents received a call. they had to come to school and it was something serious. i quickly called my friend and it turned out he had been called too. the principle, head of it and some other people were there. my friend went in first. after about an hour he came out, grinning and whispering that they didn’t have anything. \nwe went in. my mother was informed of what i was accused of. she didn’t flinch. she took it in. then they turned to me. the prinicple made it very clear that they already knew everything, herp van der derp had already confessed. if i just gave it up it would be better for everyone. i did the only thing i could do. with a straight face and not a doubt in my mind i lied and said i had no idea what they were talking about. the prinicple looked very dissapointed, but before he could say anything my mother said to him “you know he’s lying right?” and then she turned to me and said i’d better tell the truth or i would be in for big trouble. i had lied many times before, i like to think i can lie pretty well, but my mother, she just always knows. so there i was, i had this whole room convinced i really didn’t have anything to do with it, but my mother called me out. and i respect her very much, so after my puppy eyes didn’t work on her i gave it up. i said i had done it all on my own and that herp van der derp had nothing to do with it. they knew i was lying, because the evidence they had only pointed to him, but without a confession they couldn’t do anything. we were send away and i would hear my sentence later. my parents grounded me for months and i wasn’t allowed near a computer for god knows how long.\n\ni didn’t receive my sentence from school immediately. they reported us to the police for theft, fraud and some other things, but my parents and their lawyer made that go away luckily. the argued that it all had happened within an educational environment and that the school was expected to keep an eye on us, not report us when they fail to do their job. that made the police stuff go away.\nherp van der derp and i were also called into the prinicpal’s office at some point. the principal then conveniently leaved, but left his computer open. i didn’t trust it, and we were still in spy mode, so i checked his computer and it turned out he had a voice recorder running. i confronted him with it and he said he wasn’t convinced that i’d done it all alone and he didn’t understand why i wanted to take the fall for it by myself. he did credit me for not being a rat after the dust had settled though, as did my parents. \nanyways, i got suspended for some time and received a fine/bill for all the hours made cleaning up our mess. i split this bill with herp van der derp. i don’t remember what amount it was, but i remember that it felt like a lot at the time. my parents said it wasn’t too bad. \n\nin the time after all of this i got my own little article in the school newspaper, this was also where they mentioned the estimates on how many people cheated because of us. i got a girlfriend who was impressed by my bad boy history (she was also the daughter of one of my teachers), we were together for 2 years. i got kicked out of school that year because of poor grades and this of course. eventually graduated somewhere else with all in all two years delay. got a summertime job fixing computers and i still give computer lessons. on all job interviews i’ve told this story and it helped me get the job each time. i’ve also apologized a million times to my parents for how horrible i was as a kid and that i regret the sorrows that i’ve caused them. i truly do. my entire high school life was a nightmare for them. poor grades, suspensions, skipping school, this and so much else. they think it’s silly i want to apologize for it, but i always feel i need to. they’ve done so much for me while i really didn’t deserve it and i hope i can someday repay them for it. \n\n\nanyways, that’s it. i’ve grown up to be quite boring. the above is my closest encounter with the cops. i’m still considered the computerguy by everybody i know, but that’s mainly because i know all the keyboard shortcuts from heart and not much else. sometimes though i remember little things i did and learned in that time which make me smile, and secretly i hope i get a kid who’s like i was (don’t let my girlfriend hear that though).\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: i'm writing this roughly 3 hours after the incident. i was given 2 weeks to prepare and memorise a 350 word essay for my spanish assessment and, being the jackass i am, decided to cheat on the assessment and bring in my whole, pre-written essay to the exam on my phone. i decided to put in on my chair (between my legs) so i can quickly look at it and remind myself what to write. after writing half a page, i was suspected to be cheating when i was caught looking down at my legs and the examiner made me stand up to reveal my phone resting on my chair. my paper and phone was immediately taken away and i was sent outside the room. a few minutes later, my teacher brings the official exam adjudicator (or whatever) to speak to me about what happened. after rebuking  me for my dishonest practice, i was made to copy and paste the notes on my phone to email it to her. these were printed out and sent to the official aqa exam board. for those of you unfamiliar with this, in the uk, there many many different exam boards that host and moderate exams for every subject with their own syllabus and whatnot (to put it simply). aqa was the exam board under which i was doing my spanish assessment, which counts towards my overall gcse grade in spanish. gcse is basically the \"qualification\" type thing you get for a subject after completing your exams/coursework for your chosen subjects. i'm not exactly sure what the equivalent of this is in america.\n\nwith my fuck up, i risk not only being unable to get a gcse in spanish but also being banned for doing any exams under aqa, which means that my maths and history are in trouble too. the head teacher (principal) of my school and the exam board will decide what's to be done but i'll hopefully be able to take my exams, otherwise, there's 0% chance of me getting into university. as someone who's aspiring to go into medicine in the future, i cannot express how much i regret my decision. i would rather have to be patted down before every examination over completely fucking up aspirations in life. i kid you not, i would rather take a thousand lashings over having to ruin my future chances of success. now, i'm just waiting for a phone call from my school to let my parents, who are still uninformed, know what happened. i'm too scared to tell them what happened and i'm dreading that phone call but i'll just have to face the approaching storm. wish me luck, guys.\n\n \n \nupdate (2 days after): today was the last day of school before good friday and the 2-week easter holiday. i had to do internal isolation today because of what i did. basically, i was put in this one room for the whole day and had to get on with some normal work and whatnot. 1 hour left until the end of the day until i'm told that a very distraught mrs.op'ssurname has just been informed of what happened and will be coming in. she came pouring with tears and we talked in private and with my teacher. turns out i'll still be able to do the spanish course but i'll be receiving extra supervision during any exams for all subjects from now on. basically, they'll be circling me like vultures during all examinations henceforth. in addition, i'll be receiving some more standard school punishments etc. despite this, i'm overjoyed because it was the best-case scenario of what could've happened, however, i am still very depressed because i gave my poor mother a heart attack, who thought her only son would live the rest of his life as a down-and-out with no qualifications. i explained why i cheated on the exam as well. my father is extremely abusive and i'm in complete fear of him. if i brought home a b in spanish, i would've been tasting his knuckle for a week. i'm not talking just mere spanking here and i'd rather not go into detail. asian parents are crazy, man...on top of having to deal with a failing marriage with my asshole dad admitting that he cheated on my mother, i almost gave her a stroke to top it off... i know that social services will get involved but we've both agreed that it's for the best to remove that massive tumour out of our lives but i digress.\n\ni've learned from my lesson and now see this in kind of a good light. it's better that i learned to not cheat early on instead of having to face much more severe repercussions in the future. on top of this, i met a completely new side of my mom today. she said that she doesn't care what grades i get or what career i go into, all a mother wants to see is her children be happy (translated as best as i can). i feel as if a massive burden has been lifted off my chest but the crinkles will still remain to remind me of what i did. family issues don't justify what i did and i realise that as well. take it from me, cheaters never prosper - i was just extremely lucky. thank you for reading and i hope i won't have to update this again. fingers crossed and god bless.\n [OUT] ",

had a history of ulcers, but usually a zantac or two takes care of it. anyway, i spent most of the day in bed, because it was to the point i was unable to walk. finally, i just can't take it anymore. i take my kids to my mom's and head over to the drug store to see what i can pick up that might help. \n\ni get to the drug store and there is nowhere to park except right on the main road, behind the bus stop. this is a major intersection in town, basically where all the tweakers hang out and it's a high crime area in town. it's also the closest drug store to my house, and i always go there. i usually park right in front and head in with my \"don't even fucking talk to me\" face so i avoid any issues. but today, i had no choice but to park in the one place that would leave me most vulnerable of being fucked with. \n\ni park the car and open my door, hit the lock (it's an older vehicle, no key fob), and go to get out when a huge gust of wind hits and suddenly some money (change from using a pay parking lot) i hastily stashed in the door the day prior goes flying out of my car and of course, under it. \n\ni hop out and pick up what i can see as the wind is blowing, and then see a bunch of ones under the front driver tire. so i close my door so i can get the money before it blows away, and right there and then realize what i had done. i just locked my fucking keys in the car. my hand instinctually goes to my hip where i usually so diligently clip them. i reach down and grab the money and put my hands and face on the glass, and just stare at my keys, purse, and cellphone so blatantly laid out on the seat, ready to be stolen. i look around, trying to figure out what i'm going to do. of course my next move is to check all the doors, frantically pulling on all the handles which does nothing except make me panic even more. i look around the parking lot, try to approach a couple people who pretend not to hear me (because i look like a dirt bag, i've been in bed all day floored with the stomach thing), and then i realize i need to make a decision. \n\ni live about a mile from this drug store, so i decide to go to my house and try to get in and get the spare. i can ride a bike back to the store. cool. so i head to my house, trying to go as fast as i can with the stabbing stomach pain. \n\ni walk/jog the mile home, and try every window and door in front. that was a bunch of nope. the gate is locked, so in order to get in back, i pull a trash can over to the 7ft fence and a plant stand so i can climb up on the trash can. i finally make it in the backyard and try all the windows and the back door. everything is locked except a small window over my kitchen sink. i should add that this window is locked too, but just with the standard handle lock, while all the other windows have one of those little twisty locks in the track. \n\ni try this kitchen window for what felt like 20 minutes but could have been just 5 minutes because i don't have my phone and therefore i have no sense of time. it doesn't budge. i try unscrewing the frame. nope. \n\ni pace the backyard and then it occurs to me that if i have to break a window, that kitchen window is it. it's the smallest and it's an older window so it's going to be the cheapest fix. i have this weird, heavy, sharp metal chisel tool that i found on the side of the house that i was trying to jimmy the window open with so i use it to break the window. i hit it four times and nothing. finally, i hit it hard enough on the fifth try. there is broken glass everywhere. i find something to put in the window so i can crawl in. \n\nsuccess. \n\ni find my spare keys and at the same time i realize i have no way to get into the garage to get the bike to ride back to the store so i lock the door and walk/jog back to the store. it's freezing, i am in jeans and a t-shirt, and it doesn't occur to me until many hours later that i could have grabbed a jacket before heading back down there. \n\nthe entire time i am heading back to the store, i am in full blown panic attack mode, knowing how bad i fucked up by basically putting my shit on display ready to be stolen. i'm running and choking and trying to catch my breath. i smoke a pack a day. this is not easy. \n\ni finally get close enough to the store and see my van is still there. someone gets out of his car and asks if i'm ok. he saw me running and apparently i looked pretty upset. as i jog past him i tell him \"i locked my keys and phone in the car and ran home to get my spare.\" so nonchalant. \n\ni get to the car and everything is how i left it. i open the door and get inside and call my mom, so out of breath. i go back to her house, not even going inside the drug store for the stomach medicine. i get there and my husband calls me, so i tell him what happened. he is just in shock and doesn't know what to say. i tell him i will call him back once i get home. \n\ni hang up and my mom asks me why i'm so quiet. i tell her i'm just going over in my head what i just did. and she just starts laughing. and then i start laughing. i must have looked so stupid. \n\ni cleaned up all the glass and didn't bother putting cardboard over it because the window has plantation shutters inside so it blocks the air good enough. except last night, it got down in the 30's, which is rare for the area i live. heater ran all

you’re watching that show??” in my mind i was like “oh man, she’s hardcore judging me right now” so i replied “nah, it’s whatever i don’t even know why i watch this show, i don’t even watch it that much” (i definitely watch it that much). \n\nthe episode ended so i told her i’d change it, and asked her what she wanted to watch. “comedy, i assume?” i said. “yeah, that or horror would be fine” she replied. we looked through both hulu and netflix to find a comedy, but nothing popped out so i reluctantly went to horror because i ain’t a wuss, i need to impress this girl. the very first horror movie that popped up was the original saw movie, and i said that i’d never seen it, and she said she’d never seen it either. alright, saw it is. \n\nas the movie was starting, she pulled out some “dank herb” and asked if i wanted to get high. i’ve smoked several times before, this wasn’t a first time or anything so i told her “hell to the yes i’m down to get jiggy with that jazz cabbage, ya dig?” (or something like that, i may have paraphrased a bit). at that point, mcsheamus’ girlfriend hank came downstairs and saw that we were engaging in two of her favorite activities, horror movies and dank herb so she asked if she could join us. \n\nthe movie played and i got high as shit. you know when you get super high and the room and air around you just starts pulsing and you can feel it and it’s super cool? maybe that’s just a me thing but i was indeed, quote: “high as shit.” now one teensy detail i had not been aware of is that saw is gory as fuck. that shit would’ve terrified me sober, and in this instance of me being quote: “high as shit,” saw was a nightmare i couldn’t wrench my gaze from. it amazed me that something this messed up could come from the mind of another human being, with reference to both the jigsaw character in the movie, and the actual person who wrote this twisted shit. \n\nthe movie ended and we all just kind of stared at the credits, and then slowly looked at each other. “that shit was twisted” i said, “like i didn’t know what the word twisted meant until i saw this movie, that was twisted as fuck.” at that moment, i realized i had to pee so i stood up from the couch rather quickly. as soon as i was on my feet i realized something was wrong. i was thinking about the movie and how messed up it was, not to mention still high as shit. those two factors mixed with me standing up from the couch too fast was a recipe for disaster. i started salivating, like, a lot and i knew i was going to throw up. i speed walked to the bathroom, still trying to appear chill in front of the ladies, and covered my mouth as soon as i was out of sight. the bathroom was only 20 feet away but it felt like a mile. \n\ni opened the door, turned the light on and before i could even step foot onto the tile, boom! projectile vomit all over the floor (and a lovely streak down the wall). my hand was still over my mouth at that point so everything just sprayed through my fingers. (lovely.) i closed the door behind me and locked it and turned around and immediately went for round two all over the floor and my clothes. i just sat there for a bit looking at the disaster area i had just created and let out a long sigh before stripping down to nothing and tossing my clothes in the one corner of the room left unscathed. this was the highest quantity of vomit that has ever left my body in my entire life. if you remember, earlier that day was friendsgiving so all the food i ate that day now sat on the floor in front of me. there was fucking macaroni everywhere (pasta salad was my dish, heyyyyy represent). \n\ni knew i could’ve been a dick and just passed out then and dealt with my shame in the morning but no one deserved to see what it looked like in there. i stayed up until 5 in the morning cleaning up like a champ until that bathroom was spotless. apparently i did so good of a job cleaning up that raúl and mcsheamus didn’t even know what had happened until i told them the next day. don’t mix horror movies and drugs (and standing up too quickly?) especially if gory movies make you nauseous while sober.\n\n \n\n~obviously not their real names, probably unnecessary but making up names is fun\n [OUT] ",

(they were kind of a nerdy crowd, so it seemed appropriate for me to befriend them). \n\nnow, alot of these folk were from nigeria, libia, india, etc. just a fact you need to remember for the rest of this story to make sense.\n\nanyone, one day i was hanging out with these folk after school. we passed an apartment block when one of their nigerian friends (who lived at the top floor) threw a banana at us from his balcony. it landed at my feet. it was dark, rotten banana (another detail you should remember).we had a laugh and i shrugged it off.\n\nso anyway.\n\nthe next day, we were in school a lunch time, all together in a big group. the subject of the banana was brought up, and i knew it was my chance to get a bit of spotlight (since the banana had fallen in front of me). \n\nso  i cracked some jokes about the situation. how i though it was a sign from god to get more potassium in my diet, etc. kinda corny, but everyone laughed and i was finally starting to fit in!\n\nthen i described the banana to them.....but i didn't actually *say* i was describing the bruised, rotten banana.\n\nbasically, what i did was, once everyone stopped laughing, was smiled and i loudly declared.\n\n\"**big black fucker!**\"\n\nof course....they didn't think i was describing the banana. they thought i was describing the nigerian fellow who threw the banana.\n\nthe room went silent, and being the clueless dult that i am, i didn't even realise what i had just said. in fact, more time passed then i care to admit before i caught on. \n\nat this point, everyone was akwardly looking away. some of them stood up and walked away. others turned and started making silent conversation with the person next to them.\n\nthen it hit me.\n\ni started to plead my case. tell them i was describing the banana. but they didn't seem to believe me. one of them akwardly laughed before everyone started to pick up their bags and make their way to class.\n\nneedless to say, i did not remain friends with them, and spent the rest of the year hanging out with an overweight neckbeard guy who constantly talked about marxism. \n\nfortunately since then, i have acquired social skills. i'm even still friends with the neckbeard guy. but oh man, that was one of the most awkward, larry david moments i ever had in my life!\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: for a change of pace, this actually all happened today within the last 10 hours. \n\nso my fuck up starts at 7am this morning, when i decided to get out of bed to move my car so i could get ready to work (the street i parked on was a 2hr parking 8am-10pm). i throw on some sweats, still half asleep, and hike the 4 blocks in the freezing cold to where i'm parked. only once i get there, i find that my car is not there. after a lap around the block to make sure i didn't just lose it, it doesn't take me long to realize that the local parking nazis, aka the philadelphia parking authority, decided to put up \"temporary no parking\" signs on that one quarter block section of street where i happened to park in the middle of the night, and then towed my car before morning. the purpose of the no parking signs? what else, but a comcast utility truck that decided to do some spur of the moment digging up of the sidewalk. awesome. \n\n\ni walk back to my apartment to figure out wtf to do (i work in the suburbs and have no other way to get there). on my way in i decide to check the mailbox, to find i received a jury duty notice. shitty, but i'm too mad about my car to even care.\n\nso i call the ppa to figure out what to do, and they tell me i have to go to the parking authority administrative office to request a hearing since i believed my car was towed illegally. i take the subway to the office, and wait in line for 2 hours to finally see a hearing administrator.  during this hearing, the administrator informs me not only did i have to pay the $175 tow fee, but apparently i had 2 other parking tickets on my account that were never placed on my car, now totaling $250, which i would have to pay before i could retrieve my vehicle. also, to get my vehicle, i would have to go to the ppa impound lot located on the other side of the city, in the middle of freaking nowhere from where i was. fuck.  \n\n\nso i pay my $250 in tickets, and the lady gave me directions on how to get to the tow lot via public transportation. i wait for a half hour in the freezing cold for the bus she told me to get on, and get off on the stop she told me to get off at... only to realize i'm over 3 miles from the actual lot.  at this point i'm convinced god is playing a sick joke on me.\n\n\ndefeated, i begin my shameful walk to the tow lot in the cold, hoping a taxi or something would come along (none did). note, i'm in my dress shoes for work, which are not designed for walking distances. so about halfway through my walk, the bottom of my shoe where my big toe is decides to give way, so that my toe pokes completely through.  moments after i realized this happened, while walking & texting my friend about what a shitty day i was having, i stepped in a large, half frozen puddle...filling my shoe with freezing water & completely soaking my sock.  just kill me now.\n\n\nafter about 45 minutes of walking with a frozen foot, i finally make it to the impound lot, seeing freedom on the horizon. but i wasn't getting out of it that easily.  i get to the tow office...theres 2 long lines, with no signs or instructions on which line i should be in. each line has one window with an angry ppa employee processing paperwork at a snails pace.   i wait in one of them for an hour, get to the front, only to be told i had to wait in the other line to pay first, and then get back in that line. is it okay for a grown man to cry in public? because i'm about to cry in public. \n\ni get in the other line, wait 30 minutes, pay my $175 tow fee, and get back in the first line. another hour and a half wait, i get to the front of the other line again. the lady asks for my id, insurance card, and registration card. i tell her that my insurance and registration are in my car (which is in their possesion). but the lady at the window tells me that she can't release my car or let me into my car without it.  so to recap...i can't get my car without my insurance/registration...my insurance and registration is locked in my car...and i can't get my insurance and registration out of my car without giving them my insurance and registration. oh, also they had to issue me another $76 dollar ticket for the \"towing violation\" separate from the tow fee.... thats right, i was ticketed $76 to have my car towed on top of the $175 tow fee.   this can't be legal.\n\nso at this point i'm a broken shell of a man. i have to call the state, wait on hold for a half hour,  and then my insurance company, and wait on hold for a half hour, to fax the paperwork over to the impound.  then...just to rob me of any ounce of dignity i have left in me, she tells me i have to wait in the back of the line again before i can get my car.\n\nfinally after 8 hours, $501 later, i get my car out. i get to work 6 hours late, and as icing on the cake, my boss chews me out for not being responsible.  at this point i'm not sure i want to live anymore, and my rent check that i handed in this weekend is going to bounce from paying all of this.\n\nheres my tow receipt for some proof [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/cpwz8m3.jpg)\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: so this happened to me sunday night, and instead of locking up my computer like i should have, i did it again. for some reason when i am on adderall (only taken twice) i just want to talk and express my ideas. what better environment to do this than on a blank google doc. for the second night now, i have written nine pages of just my ideas and thoughts about life. i don't know why i did this, or why i let it happen a second time. to be clear, the two seven hour periods would add up to fourteen hours of useless writing with eighteen pages of my thoughts. i am in my senior year of high school by the way and i have studied for ap calculus exactly zero minutes and it is ten o'clock. kids are posting statuses on facebook about getting into yale and my regular decision-ass is writing \ndissertations on politics and social attitudes towards marijuana. \n\n\n\n\n*people wanted the full thing so here is the first one i wrote*\n\npreface\ni have lived a short life. at this exact moment, i am seventeen years old. i have experienced a lot, but at the same time i have such a long way to go. the idea of writing a book always got me upset. a lot of people that know me can attest to the fact that i have a very vivid, creative imagination. i like to talk a lot, and most of the time it is complete bullshit. \n\nby the way, this book is going to have some naughty language in it. sorry. \n\nanyways, in my senior year of highschool i took a semester class on modern american novels. of all of the books i read for the class, i discovered two writers. f. scott fitzgerald and tim o’brien. sure i knew about fitzgerald, but i never had read the great gatsby and that was a nice read. that was bullshit, never read the book. i was suppose to, but i said fuck it and went straight to sparknotes the night before the test. i liked fitzgerald because he was documenting life in the 20s. it was all fiction, but it gives readers a taste for the time period. tim o'brien's work is just phenomenal. the war genre was not what drew me to him, it was his voice. his writing style is personal. o'brien writes to the reader and his way of storytelling is my favorite. \n\ngiven all of those influences, i realized that i wanted to tell my story. i was born in 1998, and my lifetime will definitely be very well documented. the internet is here, we have websites and emails. donald trump is running for president. drones are starting to become more common. there’s phones made out of glass, it’s fucking crazy. \n\nbut if it's going to be so well documented, then why write about your story? when we look at history, which i do a lot (you will learn about that later in the book), historians are essentially the final say about what really happened. sure, the victor writes history, but as time goes on people can gather enough evidence to really figure out what happened. and historians aren’t going to learn about 2015 from fox news, vine, or a subreddit. so to future historians, you are welcome. maybe you will realize that we are a bunch of idiots right now. \n\nalso, i wanted to write a book just so i can say that i wrote a book. if this gets published and makes some money, future me you are welcome. i doubt i will write a book-length document, but fuck it let's go. so with that long and personal preface, let’s begin.\n\nabout me\nbefore i start rambling about the world around me and what i think about it, i am going to give you the reader some context about myself and where i come from.\n\ni am, at this exact moment of writing, seventeen years old. i go to [*removed*] and i am applying to colleges. i live in the greater los angeles area, specifically [*removed*], with my father, mother, younger brother, and labrador retriever. i would assume we are middle class, my parents can afford for me to drive my own car. i have, up to this point, always attended private school. i am caucasian. \n\nmy mom went to san diego state university and majored in communications. my dad went to usc for electrical engineering, but dropped out after three semesters. both of my parents are from glendale california. my mom’s parents are foreigners from peru and argentina, but they are both caucasian because their families migrated from france and russia.\nmy dad is italian, to an extent, and the ‘[*removed*]’ family is very large. our lineage can be traced back to my great-great grandfather who was an orphan. the only reason we have the [*removed*] last name, a very common last name, is because he picked it himself. i would have gone with something more mafia-scary like correleone, but it is what it is. \n\nmy hobbies include reading, surfing, snowboarding, and sleeping. i am five foot nine in height with brown hair. a jewish classmate has described my nose as being ‘a right triangle’, but i am russian orthodox. i do not speak russian and rarely attend services. my religion is kind of like the mole on my back, i scratch at it when i want to. i am not dedicating a chapter in this book to religion because i am not a big ‘organized religion’ kind of guy, but i like to think that god exists. \n\nthat’s really all i am going to write about my background for now. i would like to think that the more you read about me in the following pages the more you will know about me and my personality. \n\nreading\nbooks are fucking fantastic. ever since i could read, i was reading books. i wanted to read harder, and more challenging books. i wanted to one-up other kids with my ‘words per week’ score and with my completed books list. one of my friends, thomas, was telling me during break about how his dad was reading this great book to him called harry potter. first grade me was like fuck reading with parents, i’ll read that shit to myself. harry potter really was what started my obsession of reading. i finished all of the published books by fourth grade and would continue to read the new ones until their eventual end. \n\nnow at this point i was into reading book series’ because i like the continuation of stories. my own personal goals were to finish the narnia books by the end of the third grade. i knew that with my speed i could do it, but there was just one problem. my parents. they knew that i liked to read. i liked it so much that i did it instead of homework. now to parents who are reading this, i know i am the best kid ever. other people my age are probably laughing at how much of a fiction nerd i was. kids in grade school want to play jump rope and kickball, not sit under a tree and read.\nmy parents didn’t know what to do at first, how do you punish a young child for free reading? they would check in on me constantly, looking for an open book. i combated this spying by locking myself in the bathroom and hiding my book under my shirt. my grandma wanted to take me to the hospital one time because i had been on the toilet for three hours. i needed more reading time, but at the same time i needed to get good grades. for that class, i was struggling in math. i was supposed to be learning about the times tables, but my own ingenuity prevented that by hiding books underneath my desk. i had to protect my books, so when math became a problem at home, i decided to change my grades.\nthe times-table quiz sheets were passed out in class all the time for ‘at home practice’. you had to start with one and go all the way to twelve, multiplying each level number with numbers one through twelve. so what i did, and understand i was in the third grade, was make copies of the empty tables. i then would use a calculator to fill them out for each number. then i would take those to school, one by one, and switch the completed pages for the uncompleted pages that the teacher would distribute during testing time. it was flawless, we had those old-school desks with the compartment underneath so it was pretty easy to make the switch. i was the second kid to pass all twelve levels, even though i was behind, and i have no regrets. afterall, i got to finish the seven narnia books. \n\nschool, pressure, and drugs\nok well i thought the next best place to start is school, specifically high school. like i mentioned earlier, i go to [removed]. it is an all boys, jesuit-run, school that has been around since 1865. it is not that easy to get into, and it is considered to be one of the tougher schools in southern california. that first semester sealed my academic fate. i got two c’s in english and physics (yeah, they made freshman take physics) and that did not set me up well. freshman, except under certain conditions, are not supposed to take honors or ap classes. your first semester grades give the different academic departments the required information for your access to ‘restricted’ classes for the next year. then if you do good in those, they let you take more in your junior year, and all the while your unweighted and weighted gpa goes through the roof. \nnow because of that disastrous semester, i did not get to take any gpa booster classes until my junior year. and in that junior year i only got to take one, ap us history, and mind you i had to hassle the social science department head for that seat. the class was hard and i think i had the smartest kids in my grade in that class. two kids in that class are going to brown, another to harvard, and one who just got into stanford. these kids were geniuses. i felt so out of place, since i had practically killed it among the ‘stupid’ kids in my sophomore year.\nfor that entire year i was so focused on the ap exam. i was reading about the test, the times you get, and the essays you have to write. i was scared. i didn’t want to fail. if you don’t get a three on the exam, then you don’t get college credit, and if you don’t get college credit what’s the point of putting yourself through hell. \nso i sought out supplements. you hear about prescription drugs like adderall and focalin helping kids study, but the side effects listed on the internet can be daunting. lack of sleep, no hunger, buzzing sensation around your skin were just a few, but i wanted to try it anyways. there was a kid in my english class who was prescribed for adderall for his adhd. this was about a week before the exam. i had recently gotten a sixty-four percent on our practice exam. anyways, this kid doesn’t want to take his pills because he said that he wanted to eat. now i am a small, skinny guy and i don’t eat a lot anyways so when he offered them to me the fear of skipping lunch was at the back of my mind. i went to the bathroom and used sink water to digest them. i digested the pills at around 9:30 am, it was the first class of the day. that wednesday at school was probably my best day of school so far, and the only thing that will rival it might be graduation, but we haven't gotten there yet. \nso i kind of start to feel a little edgy, i’m starring in certain directions for longer periods of time, my eyes are focused, and i’m not super talkative like i usually am. i was dialed the fuck in. i was listening to everything the teacher was saying and i was actually absorbing the information. i don’t know what the dosage was, but i think it was pretty high because since then i have taken adderall a few times and never has it been so strong. skip a few periods ahead and i’m in apush. we get our practice tests back and we are going to go over the answers. now at this point i am the sharpest i have ever been. we are going through every question, one by one, and i was like a fucking magician. i knew every answer. \nsidenote, so the new apush test had a change in the multiple choice section. instead of asking specific questions, they were going to give a historical passage that you would have to interpret and then answer several questions about. they could be from martin luther king jr. or they could be from president lincoln. \ni was reading each one at very fast pace and answering each question correctly. it was if this new mental state was allowing my mind to work more efficiently. after class i felt very confident about the test next week, but my best school day was far from over. adderall, i guess to my understanding, is suppose to take the jumbled and energetic mind of a kid and make it more efficient and focused. my classes were basically over because my next period was pre-calculus but we had a sub so that meant studyhall. so after apush, was lunch. again, i was not hungry because of the drugs. i decided to use that time efficiently.\nthe lists for ap classes for senior year had been posted, and much to my dismay i had been accepted to only two. ap government and ap studio art. i was not happy with that. i then proceeded to go to the science and social science department chair heads and practically badger them about my courses for next year. they all said the same thing, “your gpa is too low”. that didn’t stop me though, because after twenty minutes i got accepted into ap physics, ap european history, and ap human geography. i didn’t want to take ap gov. because i thought the entire class would be concentrated on concepts that i could learn about on house of cards. i dropped studio art because, quite frankly, i wasn’t big on taking pictures. even for ap credit. i even had time to email my math teacher about bumping me up a percent to an a minus so i could get into ap calculus.\nthose pills controlled my brain until 1:30 the next morning and it was not until then that i was able to fall asleep. i was tossing and turning for hours, thinking about how wonderful it was, but in the back of my mind i knew i was getting addicted. i didn’t want to go down that path, so i told myself i wasn’t going to try and get a legal prescription. \nso now here i am in my senior year, taking four incredibly difficult ap classes and all the while trying to finish college applications. people, teachers and students, have told me that i am crazy because of my own academic boundaries. in hindsight it was not the greatest idea, but it hasn’t been to bad. i really did it for college. my transcripts show a struggling student who has challenged himself as much as he could throughout his four years. will it get me into a dream school like usc who has an average acceptance rate of students with 3.9s? no, but i will frame that letter of rejection and i will take it with me to every job i have ever had. that’s another fucked up system, the college application process. so the world today wants me to not have a perfect body or perfect life because perfect is overrated, but i need a perfect gpa to get into most of the good colleges? \nhigh school girls and alcohol\ni have never had a girlfriend, gone to an invite dance like formal or prom, or even really ‘been’ with a girl. going to an all-boys school has definitely added to fear of women. and it’s not like i am gay or anything, not saying anything is wrong with being gay, but women are scary. to be brutally honest, women are smarter than men. they are a cunning and ruthless sex who can make men do a lot of stupid shit. i’m not trying to be sexist here, but women are the bane of a man’s existence. an attractive girl can get a guy to go out of his way for her, and it is especially easy for guys to do this at my age. we are at the height of our sexual prime, there is a lot of testosterone going around. but since i would consider myself to be somewhat of an introvert when it comes to girls, i am safe most of the time from their control. \nhigh school girls can be super annoying. their voices are super high, they think they’re the shit, and they can complain a lot. but if a guy might has a slight chance of hooking up with her, then he his just oblivious to all of that. i have seen the fake drunk girl at parties numerous times. if i got a fucking penny for every time i heard the phrase “oh my god, i am so fucking drunk!” after half of a beer at sea level, i would be a millionaire. \nmy english teacher this year warns us all the time about doing something stupid for susie q, but a lot of the guys laugh it off. they think they’ve never been somewhat forced to do something for of a girl, but one of those laughing guys drove a girl while he was drunk so he could get her a burger from in n out. it’s like what the fuck were you thinking? i have never driven drunk, and i don’t want to. i don’t need to anyways because of apps like uber and lyft. \nalcohol is a drug, no matter what you think. so is tobacco and marijuana. these drugs are fun. people in general like to get fucked up. there is almost a universal desire among all creature to get fucked up. jaguars chew on certain plants to get high, birds purposefully eat fermented fruits, humans make their own drugs, it’s just the way it is. it’s like sex, everyone has  a desire for sex. you get dopamine from sex, so sex is technically a way of getting a little high. \nto be clear i do not condone the use of drugs or alcohol, so all the crazy conservative parents who think that i am the spawn of satan you can stop updating your hate blog and save those stamps for your christmas cards. \nin california, it is pretty easy to obtain weed. i visited colorado and washington when they were legalized and i still see more dispensaries over here. you have to be eighteen to get a medical card, after the joke of a doctor’s consent, and you can legally purchase marijuana. i have been told that you spend more time filling out your information and waiting for the doctor than you do in his office. \ndoctor: “hello, what’s wrong with you?”\npatient: “my back hurts.”\ndoctor: “that’s unfortunate.” *signs name*\ndoctor: “have a good day.”\nit is also very potent. the quality of marijuana has increased significantly and its effects have gotten stronger and last longer. it’s a billion dollar industry, and i like to think that it is our 1970s-like computer oppurtunity. to be more clear, if steve jobs and bill gates were born in 1996, they would have dropped out of harvard and come down to southern california instead of silicon valley to revolutionize the marijuana industry. \nwe’re not done yet with recreational habits like drinking and smoking, but we’ll come back to it after the most popular chill spot is addressed. college.\n\ncollege and partying\nnow college is a fantastic place, or so i have heard. you can get a degree in anything you want, if you get into those programs. you can have a starting salary of a hundred grand after graduation, but don’t forget about those college loans you took out. this excerpt will be relatively short because i lack a lot of experience with the college scene, but i do have one story to tell.\nso i was at boulder, colorado to check out the school with my friend and my parents. i have some friends who go there, so i took my friend to go visit them. of course we partook in activities related to college, but i had never been exposed to this level of intensity before. these kids could drink like nothing i had ever seen before. that might be a bit of a lie, but the density of how many people could drink that much was astonishing. and we were in fucking colorado during november and it was twenty degrees outside and these kids are wearing t-shirt, some with a light sweater. meanwhile i am back and forth to my friend’s house, which he shares with seven other guys, grabbing extra layers. \nand the party was outside! why not have parties indoors, especially there. this student friend of mine who took my other friend and i under his wing was a twenty-one year old senior. i guess you could say we were very intimidated by him and his friends because for starters they were all practically four years older than us. we were children who stood out like a sore thumb. also, one of his roommates was a very violent drunk. he threw a chair across the living room into a door and then continued to tried to break the door. all the while his buddies cheered him on. it was very scary. i had always assumed i would want to rush a fraternity, but after seeing that i was very unsure about my ability to hang. they invited us to come back the next day to witness them do the great american challenge. i’m not going to tell you what the great american challenge is, so refer to urban dictionary. it involves a lot of things including a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle and an extra large pizza, but i honestly don’t want you make anyone queasy. \ncollege seems like a cool place though, and i hope i have a good experience. after all it’s only for four years, and high school flew by like a bullet. life moves fast, that’s the only thing i know for sure about this world. \n\nkids and parties\nnow i am not a big partier. i go to a lot of functions, but i’m not the guy who takes eight shots and i’m not volunteering for keg stands. i do not really like alcohol all that much, i think it's a literal poison that makes you feel cool at night and sick in the morning. kids today like to drink, obviously, and it is easier now for kids to find parties. everything is online. facebook events seem to be the most popular option. other than that people get contacted via text message and they tell a few people and it spreads like the flu. some parties have lists, others don’t. some are big, others small. some get shutdown by police, some don’t. some are in the extravagant homes of brentwood, other’s at a beach house in malibu. \nbecause my school draws kids from all over los angeles, there are party opportunities everywhere. it is kind of like a cultural lesson. lifestyles of people in bel aire are significantly different than that of koreatown. the pacific palisades gets their police from culver city, so it is easy to keep a party going longer there. there are checkpoints on pch at night. the cops in manhattan beach have nothing really going on so all they do at night is drive drunk kids home. the streets in hollywood are full of drunk tourists at night, it almost resembles that of las vegas but without the humid air and casinos. \nthe internet has not helped with the fight against fake i.d.s. alcohol is therefore easy to obtain, which i guess has always been true except for the era of prohibition. i learned from my dad that when he was in high school it was fairly easy to get a ‘real’ fake i.d. \nso way back when you apparently could access public records to the extent that you could walk away with a copy of someone’s birth certificate. so these high school kids would go to a cemetery, find a dead child essentially who would be twenty-one, and they would go get a copy of his or her birth certificate. the dmv at the time didn’t have death times recorded in their systems, and since a birth certificate is all you really need, you hand it over and get your picture taken. sure it’s a different name but it’s also a real i.d. today that would never work, but kids have always been crafty with this kind of stuff. again, everyone wants to get fucked up or at least pretend that they’re getting fucked up. \nthe common recreational party activities has changed though, and unfortunately for the worst. beer pong is still around, the use of alcohol and party drugs still exist, but the science of the twenty-first century has given us  the vaporizer. originally built for people who are trying to quit smoking cigarettes, the vaporizer, or vape, can be used to help them reduce their use of nicotine over time without the harmful effects of tobacco. kids though, who still think smoking is cool despite the known risks, have also transitioned to the use of the vape. now we have these retards on social media doing smoke tricks, all the while they are getting hooked on nicotine. i know i should care about their health, but i really don’t. if you’re one of those kids who paid two hundred dollars for a ‘mod’ and you won’t shut-up about your enhanced atomizer or whatever bullshit engineering parts are involved, i fucking hate you. \ni really feel bad for the anti-tobacco guys who worked so hard to get the public to say fuck off to the big tobacco companies, all their hard work has just gotten us to an even worse place. sure the vapists are not harming themselves, at least as far we know today, but it is so dumb that words in the english dictionary cannot give it an adequate name. \nand i don’t really ‘fucking hate’ the vapists, but you guys look really fucking stupid. we asked for flying cars and hover boards, but this is what we got instead. \n\nsouthern california\noh man, my favorite place in america. i’ve never lived anywhere else, but even if i had i think that it would still be my favorite place. to understand a complex state like california, you first have to look at its size. it’s not the biggest state in the union, but it is big. there is a a lot of diversity between the different ‘regions’. first off you have the best part, southern california, if any norcal kids say that i’m wrong then tell them that they’re indeed the ones who are “hella wrong.” socal is densely populated and has a lot of land. the temperatures are hot, but not arizona hot. arizona hot is too hot. southern california has all of the cool stuff like the movie industry, the famous beaches, the famous streets, the famous people, great mexican food, six flags, and disneyland. central california is cool too, but a lot of the inland area is used for agriculture. the action for them happens closer to the coast, like the cities along monterey bay. now when we look at the state, you can notice that the ‘northern people’ like people from san francisco and sacramento are kind of in the middle of the state. but that’s what we consider to be norcal. now what is north of norcal? probably sasquatch tribes and hippy city states that are yet to be discovered. \nthe main thing to take away is that socal is the best. now i will brag and brag about my ‘home’, but i hate tourists. they drive me crazy. i hate seeing rental cars on the 405 and the 101 freeways driving the speed limit in the fast lanes, i just want them to go back home. the people who feel obligated to slow down on mulholland drive to take a picture of the scenic san fernando valley piss me off too. i blast hard rock like rage against the machine when i am pulled up next to one of those tourist celebrity tour vans. just leave those people alone, they don’t want you taking pictures of their homes. \nfor some reason, southern california produces the most water-polo players. i guess water-polo on the west coast is like lacross on the east coast, it’s really big on one side but not on the other. also, statistically speaking the weather is warmer and i can only assume that more pools are built than ice rinks in california. people also like to come here for our schools. if i was an international student, i would definitely work my ass off to get into a school like usc or ucla just because of where they are. kids in this country also want to come to california, it’s a unique place. the biggest downside is that we are a part of america and therefore cannot legally bar our own citizens from entering. \n\ncelebrities\ni really hate the idea of a celebrity. i would never want to be a celebrity. people chase you with a camera and try to get you to talk or touch them so you can get them paid. it’s ridiculous. they are normal people who happen to have a lot of money. when they make mistakes they get ridiculed by everyone and they are idolized as invincible by super-fans. i live near the studios, specifically disney and warner brothers. my neighborhood has a lot of celebrities in it because of its proximity to these studios, so it’s understandable that they want to be close. everytime i drive past someone's house, whether it be miley cyrus or steve carell, there are people outside waiting. it is absolutely ridiculous. \nif you thought i like to talk straight bullshit, then go meet someone who works at a studio. it is a cesspool for bullshit. i have been around that world my entire life, and you meet a lot of interesting people, but they are full of shit. it is an industry of liars and gutter politics. it seems that the only sane people are the creative animators.  anything outside of those studio offices is bullshit. marketing, advertising, pr, publicists, executives, talent, directors, producers, the writers especially, all bullshit.  \nthese are crafty people, a breed of lawless integrity. everyone thinks they have the next movie idea, or the next big screenplay. it’s a disease. people move from all over the country to try and be an actress or actor and they get nowhere because it is not what they thought it would be. it is not easy to make it in this industry, you have to have ice in your veins and a heart of stone. people get hurt, people get rich. it is a backwards psychotic world, but everyone is just looking out for two things, themselves and their wallets. my heart goes out to great, young creative artists who think they can be the next wes anderson. they instead are forced to direct porn to make ends meet. it may sound a little fucked up but if the studios won’t take you there’s always porn. sex sells, that’s the oldest trick in marketing. don’t ever forget that. \n\nthe media and politics\nthis will be great for adults in this country who are confused about the youth’s political agenda. except for the pc, super informative students, no one has a single fucking idea about what is going on in politics. the modern day career politician is not what our founding fathers envisioned, you’re not suppose to do stupid shit like get bought out by corporations or get caught cheating on your wife. what i said about us not knowing what’s going on in politics is true, but people think they know. turn on fox news, watch ten minutes, now you know why donald trump is the best. watch cnn for ten minutes, shit trump sucks. sanders is the call. the political media is just fucking stupid, like the regular social media. \nwe can now literally see the stupidity of people on our devices. from twitter to vine, people doing and saying stupid shit is everywhere. people will do anything for a like, favorite, smile, revine, rehash, and all of the other modes of approval that exist. like the old saying goes, everyone is a critic. everyone thinks they know the truth, but really they just believe in their opinion. take that one to the dinner table. my dad is a devout republican. i don’t hate for respect him for it, it just is what it is. he is a republican and i am undecided. he can tell me what he thinks all he wants, but i will not be broken by his convincing tone. same goes for liberals. i hate people who are from both sides, but a lot more of them are liberal. the liberal teachers and classmates i have had think that if they talk really loud and authoritatively then their opinion becomes true. they throw facts out about bush, guns, and more bush. and then i am politically aware enough to decide for myself that obama isn’t really anything special. but then again, like trump, you can’t judge a party by its popular leader. i think i should just make a new party for people who are equally confused. i think that gun laws and all of that other horse shit should be determined state by state. we are too big of a country to decide for everyone, so break up the decision making. the media then swoops into this big mess on a falcon and fucks up your brain even more with facts, speakers, and breaking news headlines. it’s like you want to have an opinion, but you don’t want to offend or get into a political debate with your friend. that’s my two cents anyways. just blatantly confused, and concerned. i can’t vote yet, so why even bring it up for discussion.\n [OUT] ",

read.\n\nso straight to the point me and friends finished our psychology finals at the college , we're high school students who take college classes and get a degree once were done with high school. then, adventurous me decides why don't i go exploring because why the fuck not. the final was literally 30 mutiple choice questions and every person finished within 10-20 minutes and god knows why but the professor said we had to stay until 9 and we did (it started at 8). i decided hey why don't i go to the manhattan since all i have to do is cross the bridge since we're in the south bronx. this is literally the only time i go outside aside from school when class ends this early so i can test my photography skillz. so i, planning to go alone am later accompanied with my friends who both i will just call j. \n\nwe start walking we end up at 145 for all the new york readers and then we decide to make a left and start walking towards central park as a recommendation  by j , i mean as long as i can photograph i don't really care. as we walk to our right we see city college and columbia university which was pretty cool, i guess this was the first fuck up of many , we could have just walked towards it and avoided the whole situation but persistent me decides we should just keep going to central park so we have time to take the train back to school since despite leaving class early we all still had to get to physics by 12 at the high school. we keep going and yes we do make it to central park and we start walking within it hoping to get to the other south side of it since we entered from 110th. it's not really that long of a walk if you've ever tried it and i wanted to see if we could do it. but then as we walk up a hill we see an nypd patrol van and the guys were pretty cool but they could have been avoided if autistic me didn't decide to walk along the grass where we were literally right in front of them, had we taken the pathway we could have avoided them. they start questioning us and one of the guys is bangladeshi and me being pakistani we got along well i don't know why but later on he starts asking me about extraterrestrial  life mentioned in the quran and i'm not even religious so it was pretty awkward. this officer i'll just call s was really confused he didn't understand how or why students from the south bronx ended up in central park and of course didn't believe us where the other guy blatantly asks do we have drugs because that is a common thing people do here apprently  and i don't know about my friends  but i would never do drugs so they said okay after showing our ids  that clearly said high school student on top of a college card said why don't we drop you to school.\n\nanother fuck up. i said well we still have 2 hours to kill until class even if they did take us back what would we do so thr other officer who i forgot his name tells us so why don't we do police patrolling with us tagged along. it seemed like a movie it was amazing and along the way we were talking about anime and not driving in manhattan since there was way too much traffic. i guess this was part of their plan of doing their job but we never suspected it but they told us they were taking us to a center where we could get our ids  checked and  verify we weren't cutting and we went along with it. for fucks  sake they brought us to a precinct  inside the high school of fashion industries on 23rd street like dude our school is on the other side of the city what logic is this to take us farther from school. we have class in like like an hour. spoiler we ended up 30 minutes late to class but at that point we didn't care. so back to the story, in this place we were asked for our address  and contact information which i thought was irrelevant  but nope. it was going so well we just thought we were going to stay there for a bit  while they call our school but noooo they call all of our parents like what the fuck  officers that was not cool. i understand they were doing their jobs but chill. so yea now i have no phone but i could care less , i was more concerned about my friends since it was all my fault for going exploring in the first place. right before i started writing this i found the first device i could being my mom's and got on facebook to ask them what happened after my dad fell asleep. \n\nso anyways back to the story we were written up for truency for an imaginary class we were missing when clearly we told them numerous times we had no class and then in a rush we told them we have class in like 40 minutes we need to leave and luckily the ladies there were really nice and did and showed us how to get to the train. the officers left in the middle of it like seriously i thought we were cool. i ended up telling my entire yoga class about this story and when i got home it was all hell my mom was crying saying is this how i raised you like calm down stop listening to my bigoted dad's stories since that's who they called. i explained to him everything and he's just being a dick so i'm not going to bother, i lost my phone so what the christmas break is 2 days away. i asked my friends and both said they were okay but more importantly i was focused on female j since she looked the most worried and turns out her parents were more upset with her not telling them than being with the police.  when we got to school the first thing we did was go to the vice principal since thats who they called i expected to get a lecture but he was happy we were safe it felt good i love him he's amazing. he told us this wasn't the first time it's happened and said he was ashamed because all police officers in the city should know that we are an early college school and we shouldnt have ro deal with this .this day could have not been any more exciting.\n [OUT] ",

(does that make any sense?) i was experiencing my other personalities' memories, emotions, thoughts, at the very same time that they were experiencing mine and each other's. for the first time ever, i felt that all 5 personalities were present at once, all our skulls were cracked open like eggs and the contents dumped into a big frying pan of psychological turmoil and scrambled together with reckless abandon. needless to say i was having an extremely intense experience. my boyfriend listened to me try to explain what was going on, making feeble attempts to gain control and failing, and he very bravely attempted to comfort and help me. eventually however, my mind had hit its limit, and my stomach was beginning to protest. the time had come to throw up. \n     i ran to the bathroom and got the toilet seat up just in time to barf forcefully all over my hand, the lid, the outside of the toilet bowl, the floor, the shower door, the little rug, and having enough to spare for the toilet seat and a little inside as well. yep, just in the nick of time. i locked the bathroom doors and told my boyfriend not to come in as i drunkenly cleaned up the mess while my head continued to be cleaved into pieces and smooshed back together repeatedly. \n     i finally got everything clean, mouth washed and teeth brushed, and stumbled into bed. i then proceeded to have an incredibly vivid nightmare. i may as well describe it too. \n     in the dream my boyfriend, his 5 year old son, and i were apparently housesitting at my grandma's house and sitting in the basement watching tv. the time came to put his son to bed so we put him in the next room on a couch to fall asleep. as anyone with a five-year-old knows, putting a kid to sleep is never a simple endeavor. after many excuses and attempts to stall he still wasn't falling asleep so i decided to take him to one of the bedrooms. i hoisted him up over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes, the way my dad used to when i was a kid, and carried him down the hall to an empty room with two twin beds. it was very dark and i didn't want to turn on the light and wake him up even more, so i could only see the faint outlines of things. i stood behind the head of one of the beds, intending to lift the covers just enough to deposit the sleepy child inside and tuck him in. i ran my hand over to the side of the mattress searching for the edge of the blankets, and was confused to feel a hard spherical shape there. someone was sitting on the floor with their back against the bed, their head and shoulders covered by the edge of the blankets. instead of running away like a normal person, dream me just paused for a second, and then pulled the covers away. maybe my grandma had decided to stay home after all? and didn't tell anyone? and was sitting alone in the dark waiting to be discovered? who knows how dream me justified things.  all i know is that when the head turned toward me and i saw the face, i was screaming. i can't possibly describe that face. and then it was attacking me. \n     and i woke up to my boyfriend shouting and holding my arms down, as i was apparently flailing them around as dream me tried to defend myself. after we calmed down, he fell asleep again and even though i tried to, i knew it was no good. \n     i got up and checked that the front  door was locked, got a drink of water, and came back to bed to write this. i'm feeling better now but i was extremely shaken by this experience. i may as well try to get a bit more sleep, as my stomach is still squirming.\n [OUT] ",

i shakingly dug into my console and got my proof of insurance and pulled out my driver's license. the same sheriff came to my window and before he could say anything i basically threw them at him in a nervous reaction. i glanced in my rear view window to see six or more officers were surrounding my car, all suited in body armor and wielding assault rifles. \n\nat this point my whole body went rigid and i locked my hands on the wheel with my head facing forward. i couldn't bring myself to even look at the sheriff directly, but glanced at my door mirror and saw him standing just behind my left shoulder with his hand on his weapon. he asked me where i was headed. i somehow managed to tell him again that i was going home. out of the corner of my eye, i could see the other officers raising their barrels to point in my direction, and the ones near windows were inspecting the contents of my car. after what seemed like forever, the sheriff asked me for my registration paperwork. i tried to explain to him that it was buried in my glove box and that i would need to search for it, but my words mainly came out in broken sentences. he told me to find it, and walked back behind my car. \n\ni finally got the nerve to glance over to the passenger side, and some woman was pointing a rifle at me and staring. i slowly leaned over and reached into the glove box, and began searching for my registration. every few seconds i would nervously glance up to see her rifle still fixed on my head. i finally found it, and situated myself back into my original stance with the paperwork in hand. i could see the sheriff in my rear view mirror, talking to another officer and glancing back at me periodically. finally, like being snapped out of a trance, all of the officers relaxed and lowered their rifles. it didn't matter, i was pretty sure i'd already shit my pants. \n\nthe sheriff came back and i tried to hand him my registration, but he just pushed it back at me along with my driver's license and insurance card. the other officers began to disperse and walk back to their vehicles, and all he said was \"drive safely and have a nice day, sir.\" now the anger and confusion had began to boil inside of me. as he turned, i basically yelled at him \"what the hell is going on here?!\" he turned back and told me that an escaped fugitive had stolen a car and been spotted at that same rest stop. apparently, they were searching it for \"suspicious\" activity, which i guess includes stopping there to, you know, rest. after his brief explanation, they were gone. i can't help but think that this fugitive had driven past during the whole ordeal, laughing his ass off at my misfortune. i've been through that area many times since, but never again have i or will i stop at that rest stop.\n\n \n\nedit: mobile is all fun and games until i realize that i have no idea how to use it...\n [OUT] ",

italian in heritage; college students, seemingly well-rounded. both were comedic as well, poking fun at the inconsiderate strangers who would cut in front of us and dart towards the nachos stand to appease their stomachs. i eventually learned that the older of the two sisters was recently single herself. it was implied that her boyfriend had been unfaithful. this was disheartening for sure but good to know her relationship status. overall, we all sang, danced, and talked until intermission.\n\nat this point many concert goers took the opportunity to walk around, use the restrooms, or purchase concessions, and the sisters decided to do the same. but before embarking, the older, single sister turned to me and asked if i would like a beer and what kind i would like. i respectfully declined her generosity, but she insisted and thus i quickly acquiesced. she soon thereafter returned with the promised beer. it hit the spot as best a cheap draft beer can, but i was more blown away at her kindness and boldness. i initially wrote the gesture off as returning the favor for inviting her and her sister to enjoy the concert with my group. however, after one republic took the stage, and the twilight was fading, and everyone was engrossed in the music, the dynamic between us seemed to shift--and no it was not the beer. as i was sitting behind her, i began to notice her looking back at me. she would find my eyes and smile, and i would smile in response.  we would return to singing and dancing as the music dictated. curiously, when i would move to another spot on the blankets to pester and sing with other members of my party, i would catch her looking around as if to see where i had gone. it wasn't creepy; it was flattering, and i soon forgot that the group i was with was comprised primarily of couples making me the odd man out.\n\nas the concert drew towards the end, i considered how i would ask for her number. i knew that i wanted to return her kindness, and ultimately get to further know the person behind the enamoring smile. being rather unconfident when it comes to conversing with those i am attracted to, i toiled with finding the right words. however, no amount of toiling prepared me for the sisters' impromptu decision to leave before the concert had ended--to seemingly avoid the suffocating mass exodus of music fans come closing time, a decision i imagine came from the younger sister. a few hugs were exchanged between my friends and the sisters; none with me, however, as i stood mouth likely agape save for some good night wishes and the \"you're welcome\" in response to their thanks. the older sister and i glanced at each other once more as she waved goodbye. then she was gone.\n\nthe regret was immediate. i knew i had let an opportunity slip through my fingers. i was so eager to find the right words and the perfect moment to ask for her number that that time unexpectedly expired. perhaps she would have politely declined. perhaps she would have accepted my advance in a form similar to that which i had been envisioning. i cannot help to smile when i consider my good fortune that night. yet this was an opportunity lost and a hard-learned lesson to seize the moment before it escapes. damn. but proof that ladies are capable of making the first move. my hat is off to her and others like her!\n\n \n\nbonus story - after i was handed the beer, both sisters proceeded to do some more venue exploring. i was left with my frosty beverage and continued to chat with my friends as the concert intermission continued. apparently i neglected to take a sip right away, for a couple minutes later, when i finally did so, an undercover swooped in and announced that he wanted to see some i.d. he had this cheesy, \"you're so busted\" goatee-framed grin on his face, and his get-up was ridiculous. his attire screamed suspect with his backwards cap, vending machine chains, and ed hardy t-shirt. i am not one to spot an undercover but get the f*** outta here! anyways, i handed the beer off to my buddy--who had a full beard which must qualify as identification enough--and produced the requested proof of age. turned out chief wiggins saw my female friend hand me the beer and did not see an \"21 and over\" bracelet on me thus he was ready to throw on the cuffs. he sulked back towards his undercover buddies with a defeatist look. i guess i can't blame him for his actions but his overzealous demeanor and too-cool-for-school, still-missed-the-mark get-up sure gave my friends and i a laugh!\n [OUT] ",

(no i was not wearing a rolex but my somewhat chunky [seiko](http://i.imgur.com/mqxhfbh.jpg)) a little caught off guard i looked down at my watch and looked up and said \"if i could afford a rolex i wouldn't be applying to a part time position at (insert electronics store name here). as the words were leaving my mouth i knew that i had fucked up the wording and made myself look like a fool. the interviewer proceeded to ask me if i knew what a person in his position could make. i took a shot in the dark and guessed 90k/year. anyways i didn't get called back after that but i think that was somewhat of a loaded question... i guess i could have just said no its a seiko but i was nervous.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: so, a couple of weeks ago, i was with some friends, whose names will be changed for this story. it was me, my friend histamine, my other friend satyr, and his little sister who he had to take everywhere with him. we decided to go get some frozen oven pizzas from a nearby grocery store since little caesar's (an inexpensive carry-out pizza place) was closed and the other pizza restaurants were too expensive. okay, but here's the thing... histamine and i have to pay for everything because satyr refuses to even attempt to get a job and caesar isn't old enough to get one. normally, i don't mind because i enjoy satyr's company.\nwell, we get to the store and start browsing the frozen oven pizzas. satyr kept suggesting that we get red baron pizza, but no one else agreed. i was looking for digiorno's pepperoni pizza with breadsticks, but all they had was cheese pizza with breadsticks, so i settled for a pepperoni pizza with stuffed crust. satyr was unhappy and said he couldn't eat stuffed crust pizza because he's \"lactose intolerant\". i settled for stuffed crust anyway because i've seen satyr eat ice cream, pizza, and cheeseburgers. caesar didn't want anything from the grocery store and only wanted restaurant pizza. but dammit, i was getting digiorno no matter what. histamine noticed this and stepped closer.\n\nhistamine: \"lunaticbynature, why don't you just get freschetta? it's just as good as digiorno and it's only $4.00!\"\n\nme: \"i like digiorno better.\"\n\nat this point, caesar got in front of histamine.\n\ncaesar: \"it's the same price as little caesar's! why can't we go to little caesar's?!\"\n\nhistamine: \"they're closed, caesar. lunaticbynature, just get 2 freschetta pizzas! you can buy 2 for only a little bit more than one digiorno pizza!\"\n\ncaesar: \"but it's the same price as little caesar's!\"\n\nhistamine: \"they're closed! lunaticbynature, just buy 2 freschettas!\"\n\ncaesar: \"nooooooo! it's the same price as little caesar's!\"\n\na little background, caesar is stubborn as hell. histamine can't stand being challenged. their personalities cannot and will not co-exist in harmony. so there i am, standing as histamine, a 19 year old, and caesar, a 14 year old, are literally inches from me, shoving eachother back and forth, almost screaming while they each try to present their argument over the others. then they start grabbing at me, trying to pull me closer to them as if that's gonna help. at this point, it wasn't even about the pizza. it was a fight to gain dominance... a dick measuring contest... to see who would have the last word. keep in mind, this is all in public.\n\nhistamine and caesar overlapping eachother as they push and shove eachother around the aisle: \"just buy a freschettaaaaaa!-noooooooo, little seezeerrrzzz!-it's cheaaperr!-lunaticbynatuuuuuurreeee! little seezers!-only $4.00!-itz da same priiiiiiiicceee!-just as good!-as little seezeeerrrzzz!\"\n\ngod knows how long this went on for... it felt like centuries. millennia... eternities. i was frozen in a state of disgust and disbelief as the scene played out in front of me. i can't explain to you how upsetting it was. caesar doesn't just raise her voice... no, if that were true, god wouldn't bestow mercy as it all would've been spent on making caesar's voice bearable. but no, such fantasies are for children. reality is dark and twisted... \nwhen caesar raises her voice, it becomes an unholy screech. you feel it slicing into your soul. you can feel hell and its host rising up to lay upon your tympanic membranes when caesar unleashes her horrendous screech.\nat this point, my nerves were on edge. i was starting to freak out internally. i already don't like constant loudness, especially when it's inches from my face, pulling me closer to it. and the whole time, satyr was brooding down the aisle because i settled on the stuffed crust pizza and not what he wanted.\ni could feel myself feeding off the dark side of the force. i felt the rage flowing through my veins. i almost drew my lightsaber and ended them then and there, but i decided against it (i wish i had a lightsaber...). finally, i spoke to histamine.\n\nme: \"i'm buying the digiorno. you can buy the freschetta.\" \n\nhistamine agreed, but not after informing me once again that it would be cheaper to get the freschetta pizza. okay! problem solved! i didn't lose myself and force lightning my friends to death, but i was still reeling.\ni offered to buy a 2 liter of coke and went up to the checkout counter with the pizza and coke. suddenly, satyr sets a large snickers chocolate bar down onto the checkout counter, accompanied by caesar setting down an orange crush. i watched in disbelief as the snickers and crush made contact with the rotating belt on the checkout counter. any spark of sanity was quenched and my world faded to black as i unleashed the full potential of my hatred. everyone died.\n\nalternate, true ending:\nokay, so obviously i didn't kill my friends. but satyr and caesar really did set items on the rotating belt without asking me, expecting me to pay for them. i don't know why i didn't say anything. i don't know why i didn't put my foot down. i guess i was just too exhausted. i didn't wanna have to deal with any more griping or brooding... or screaming... and so i let them...\ni know... what an insufferable act of weakness and cowardice. \ni should've stood my ground and said \"put that shit back, you little bastards.\"\nbut no... i became the one person i always frowned upon. like the father whose children are little brats because he's too tired and lazy to discipline them. not that i'm satyr or caesar's father, nor do i have such authority, but in the moment, when we were all acting like children, i could have been. but i relinquished the opportunity to help satyr and caesar grow because i was stressed out... just before i exited the store, i whipped back around and bought a pack of cigarettes. i handed histamine the keys and told him to drive. he complied. i climbed into the bed of my truck, isolating myself from my friends. shakily, i fumbled around with the pack of cigarettes until i managed to retrieve one. as i lit the cigarette, i leaned back against the cab of the truck and listened to the calming sound of the engine, trying to forget about caesar's screeching voice, but also feeling guilty for not trying to teach satyr and caesar that they don't get everything they want, especially when other people are paying for it... i felt like such a failure as a father, and i don't even have kids yet! so i drew my lightsaber and plunged it into my heart.\n\n\nalternate, alternate, actually true version:\ni didn't kill myself in the end.\n [OUT] ",

(i loved naming them shit like that because it made the game more amusing for some fucked up reason) i apologized for the accident but she wasn't having it. she didn't say anything else and i avoided her the entire time they were here. it's my fault i guess. i'm sure i'll hear about it in my manager's office soon. i felt bad but it was an honest accident.\n [OUT] ",

and then i realized that it must have been key locked so i went to get the spare key from the shed.\n\ni punched in the code (code b) to the shed and went to the key spot. to get the key you have to type in the same code (code b), easy enough right? but in my shit filled head i typed in the wrong code and the key wasn't popping out. i was frustrated and confused and in no way in the mood for a stupid machine to make me shit myself. i undid the code and retyped it hoping it was jammed, but it wasn't.\n\ni went back to the door and tried punching in the code (code a) hoping that the door would open. you know how sometimes you just pray that maybe it will change like god was like \"lets give him a break\"? that's what i was hoping for, but i realized that it was key locked. for sure wasn't jammed. i was starting to freak out as i really didn't want to shit my pants whilst being locked out of my house. that would suck, having to sit outside with poop in  your underwear waiting for you brother to come home to laugh at you.\n\ni went back to the shed and typed in the code again. i don't know why or how i even got the code wrong in the first place because i used it to get into the shed but you freak out when you have to shit, so i mean, it sucks but i had to deal with it. i looked at the code i had punched in and realized that it was wrong, i changed it but to a different wrong answer thinking that my new one would be right. but still wrong. i was going into major panic mode at this point. \n\ni close the shed and run to my neighbors house (who just happens to be my aunt and uncle). i knock on the door hoping that they would open up and let me poo in a toilet but after waiting a minute, no answer. i knocked again even harder knowing that if someone is in there they would hear. no response again. at that point i had a choice. either shit in their backyard ravine, shit in my backyard ravine or shit right there. i chose to shit in my ravine so i wouldn't feel as bad about it. \n\ni started sprinting to get to my backyard. i don't think i have ever ran that fast in my life. but my next door neighbors have a little stone porch, not too high maybe 2 feet off the ground but it was in my way so i hopped on it and kept running and then hopped back down. but i suppose that little impact of the tiny jump was just enough to push the poop outside my bum and as i was standing outside my backyard in front of the gate i had given up. i knew that i had lost the battle so i figured that i may as well not totally lose so i took off my shoes so they would survive the poonami and my backpack as well because whenever you poop, you pee. \n\ni started to pee and was just in total disappointment that i, a near 16 year old boy was standing there just about to shit his pants. i finished the poop and i finished the pee and opened my gate to the backyard. i waddled to the ravine and put all my belongings on a tree stump next to me. \n\ni took off my pants and pulled down my underwear and a nice large brown blob of poo plopped down by my feet. i couldn't just leave it there so i took off my underwear and used it as a glove to pick up the poo and i wiped my bum as well with the not poopy side and i flung it into the ravine. there was still a lot of poo in my bum so i took of my pee soaked sock and wiped my bum as well and i flung it into the ravine as well. i then took off my last sock and wiped my bum again and threw it into the ravine. as it was the last sock i watched it fly off  into the ravine and saw it land on a nice branch. lo and behold, my shit covered underwear hung just 2 branches beneath it. \n\ni would have tried to knock it down with a rock or something but i was in no mood for that. i pulled up my pants and put on my backpack and started to waddle back to the house. there was a discernible dark pee spot on my pants so i was really hoping no one saw me. \n\ni went back to the shed and went to the key machine and saw the code. i was practically fuming when i saw the code and my sheer stupidity at putting in a wrong one. i quickly changed it and *dink* i got the key. went to the door, opened it up, put the key back and walked inside. \n\nright as i closed the house door i heard a gurgle in my stomach even louder than the other ones so i threw everything i had to the side and booked it up the stairs to the washroom. i heard a countdown in my head practically going \"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\" and right as it was at 2 i plopped my butt on the toilet seat and shat away. i was pretty relieved that the 2nd wave happened in the toilet but still pretty disappointed in myself for shitting my pants.\n [OUT] ",

was it one of our guys?\" \"uh actually i'm not sure, i just got here and saw the sign and called. i'll be down the hall if you need me.\" he let out an audible loud sigh of disgust. which i mimicked (as to not seem suspicious) kind of as i made my way away from the crime scene. \n\ni heard him going at it with some kind of industrial pipe snake (assuming). it didn't take that long. then before i knew it he busted through the door at full sprint. i poked my head out of my cubicle and muttered \"appreciate it!\", to which  he replies: \"uh yeah housekeeping is gonna need to be called after that. its pretty messy.\" \n\noh..... that can't be good. it was around noon by now. he ran out so fast that i wasn't sure if i was supposed to call housekeeping or if he was sending them from the main campus. whatever. it was my problem now. so i decided to wait a little while. to see if housekeeping was coming. and i also had to see exactly <why> housekeeping <needed> to come. so i peeked. \n\nthere was shit everywhere. on the walls, on the floor, and all over the seat. \n\nas i went back to my desk i had to compose myself enough to run through the scenarios. i could wait for housekeeping.. but it didn't seem like he called them. i could clean it myself.. but if housekeeping showed then how would i <explain why> i'd cleaned up. plus i didn't have a toilet brush. and one was definitely needed. i toyed with the idea of calling my boss, but decided against it. too much to explain. all i could imagine was an office full of atleast 20 women showing up monday morning trying to figure out what happened. and pointing fingers. that was the worst. so after weighing my options: i decided to set to work. i no longer had the luxury of being just a regular employee. \n\ni'd have to hide the evidence. housekeeping wasn't coming til monday night. i put together a kit with some 409 i found in the kitchen, and some grocery bags i had in my desk. i set to work. the 409 was a godsend. i was thankful for the lemony fresh scent. it wasn't that bad. protip: you can wad up papertowels into a wand for a makeshift toilet scrubber. \n\ni cleaned. i was free. \n\nhousekeeping never came that day. bosses never got called. and coworkers never got to point fingers.\n\ni'll never use that toilet or order a mcdonalds frappe again.\n\n \n\n\n\nupdate: they still haven't fixed the toilet. it has evidently been plunged/ snaked several times to the point where there are deep gouges in the bowl.\n [OUT] ",

traveling for 6 months. a few months ago i found myself in the beautiful country of peru. \n\ni've been known to be a bit of a loose cannon. normally always in control but every now and then it can get a bit wild, and of course, peru was more on the wild side.\n\nso cocaine in peru is very cheap, and pretty potent, i'd been partying a lot towards the end of my visit to that country. one night i went out clubbing. had a few cheeky beverages and and a couple of nose beers. i met a few locals that night, one of them was cute and we talked for a while, but she ended up leaving early. ended up talking to a gorgeous local girl and we got along really well, despite the language barrier. at the start i straight out asked her if she was a prostitute (very common in this club) and told her i don't pay for sex. she assured me she wasn't. a few more drinks later (two of which she bought for me) and i blacked out completely, which is rare for me as i'm a big bloke. so i may or may not have been drugged. i'll assume i had been for my own benefit/moral compass. \n\nmy next memory is being in a taxi with 3 people. one of them was a peruvian guy i'd met a few days before in my hostel, one was the girl, and the other was another random girl. i recall a brief conversation to a friend from home on snapchat asking them to track my location via the app just incase, as where i was located was well known as a dodgy place for robberies. i thought i may had been drugged and was going to get mugged, as i kept blacking out. my next memory was standing at the desk of a hostel reception. the cute girl who had left early from the club was the receptionist who was checking us in. i was confused, but way too intoxicated to understand what was happening. after that my next memory is being in a hotel room with all three of them. i remember seeing the guy in the corner getting his dick sucked by one of the girls. i was confused as fuck, my girl was lying on the bed in a seductive pose. i briefly remember filming the room with my phone and sending it to the same friend i had contacted earlier. \n\nnext thing i know it's morning and there's a loud banging on the door. i'm naked next to one of the girls, who is also naked but sleeping. the other two are gone. i get up, feeling like absolute death and answer the door after chucking on some pants. it's the guy from my hostel. he tells me his girl was gone when he woke up, as well as his phone and wallet. i told him i don't remember anything and he mentions his memory is pretty incomplete too. apparently at some point they got another room. my girl wakes up and starts yelling that i owe her money and i can't leave without paying her. i went off, telling her i don't pay for sex, and that she said she wasn't a prostitute. the guy from the hostel starts yelling at her about her friend robbing him. we decide to bail, as obviously we are in a shitty situation. he tells me the reception has my license. when i get to reception it's the same girl from last night. becomes clear to me that it's some sort of prostitution ring type situation. the girl from my room runs down to reception and is yelling in spanish at the girl. receptionist tells me i can't get my license back without paying. i grabbed it from her and told them to get fucked and left with my mate. \n\nwe jump in an uber and tell him where we needed to go. turns out it's an hour away from our hostel. during this time i make the discovery that i have countless snapchat messages from all of my friends and some family. i start going through some of them. most of the guys were saying things along the line of \"hahaha you loose cunt\" or \"go hard son\" type messages. the girls replies were less than impressed. my exs was \"what the fuck, i don't want to fucking see that shit, fuck you\". the girl i was starting things with just said \"wow\" and the rest were along the lines of \"wtf dude\".\n\nthen i see one from my sister. \"what the fuck, you're in so much trouble you fucking idiot\".\n\nturns out throughout the night of sex and drugs i had snapchatted most of it. over 20 videos and countless photos were sent to everyone on my friends list, and also posted to my story. all my friends, my coworkers, and worst of all my family, including my extremely religious 15 year old cousin. i only saw some of the videos that were on my story, they were horrific. graphic as fuck, full on close ups of the sexy times. some of them had been saved to my phone as well. i erased the story videos instantly and looked through who had opened what and began damage control. everyone i messaged not to open them opened them almost instantly. my mum hadn't opened hers yet. there were about 25 videos sent to her. i messaged her through facebook and told her i had been drugged and had sent horrible videos to her, asking her not to watch them. she watched them immediately.\n\nmy parents and family are very innocent, dad once smoked half a cigarette and threw up, so i'm a bit of a black sheep. no one was talking to me in the family other than my sister.  she told me the parents weren't upset about the sex, but one of the videos has me snorting a line of coke up her thigh, and proceeding to eat her out. they knew i'd smoked weed, but not that i had done other things.\n\ni didn't talk to my family for 3 months. on christmas i got a message off mum saying all the family were together and wanted to skype call me. it was a horrific call, no one mentioned the incident, everyone was really awkward and kept convos short. except for my grandma, who had been sheltered from the incident and was extremely excited to talk to me. i still hadn't talked to dad, and he \"wasn't around\" for the christmas call. \n\ni've arrived home now, and had no where to stay as i moved out to travel. so now i'm back living with the parents. still no one has mentioned it. it's super awkward. lowest point of my life, but at least i got a good story out of it. my dad is talking to me again now and it seems to be slowly getting better. the girl i was interested in doesn't talk to me anymore.\n\nat least my std checks came back clean.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: first post on reddit ever so be gentle... and i'm sorry for the essay. i'm very verbose in general, and i don't feel like filtering myself more than absolutely necessary... if you don't want to read background, skip the next two paragraphs.\n\nok, so the events mentioned in this post occurred beginning two saturdays ago. it was my friend's birthday, and he had a party at his apartment with a good number of people. overall good time, i got just the right amount of intoxicated until my rangers ended up losing to the penguins 4-2. then i got even more just the right amount of intoxicated to drown my sorrows... anyone who knows hockey knows they won the series so everything turned out well in that round at least.\n\nanyway, that doesn't have too much to do with the story besides my level of intoxication. i showed up about a half an hour or so early to the party because i had just finished up helping my parents clean out my grandma's old attic (we just moved her into a home, she can't take care of herself and needs medical supervision), and the house was much closer to my friends place than my residence.\n\nok so here's the start of the relevant part... i get there early and it's my friend, his roommmate, and their friend who happens to be this really attractive girl. we sit around, hang out, and shoot the shit for a while. she seems really chill, we're all ripping on each other and she goes with it which makes her seem infinitely more hot; i love a girl who is not only sarcastic/has a personality, but doesn't take herself too seriously. i start chatting with her, chat her up at various points throughout the night, and eventually get her number.\n\nnow here's when things get interesting; a good friend of mine had arrived at the party about an hour and a half to two hours after me, and i had seen him also chatting this girl up. i know this guy decently well, but i didn't wanna be that guy to bring up the girl in question and ask him to back off; who am i to put myself before my friend? i kinda just hoped he wouldn't pursue... needless to say, he did, and i saw phones get broken out from across the room. so i'm kinda miffed, even though i have no real right to be, and i decide i need to assert myself. about 10-15 min later, before this girl leaves for the night, i pull her into the hallway outside the apartment and ask if she wants to grab coffee or a drink sometime; no pressure, but i just wanted to know if you'd be interested. she says yes, i feel like a million bucks.\n\ni go back inside, she leaves a little later, and at some point in the night someone in a conversation group brings up that my friend had gotten this girl's number, in a \"i saw that, nice job man\" sorta way. so i'm more than a little drunk at this point (the rangers lost, remember?) and i go to my friend and say \"nice job, but i got her number too... idk how you wanna go about this, but if you wanna compete, i'll compete\". so he just kinda smiles and shrugs.\n\nthat's all i know from his end at this point. i text the girl the next day, good responses and we're chatting each other up. i'm thinking that this is going great... then i meet up with my friend on the tuesday after, and find out he's chatting her up and they had plans for wednesday night at her place -_-\n\ni told him i was in the game, and we agreed to compete, keep the gloves on, and play it fair. and i think he's someone i can trust to stick to that sentiment. we're going to let her decide... now to clarify on my friend, he's one of those guys who wants what he can't have and doesn't care for what is more accessible to him because it's too easy. so essentially what i did is took something that might've been an idle pass-time for him at most, and made it interesting. so that's the fuck up here, and why this is worthy of tifu.\n\nto wrap things up, she cancelled on him for that wednesday and as far as i know they still haven't seen each other at all. i haven't seen her at all either; i'm insanely busy between work, classes ending (i'm getting my masters) and finals coming up, and she's busy for her own reasons. so it's all still in limbo i guess. but my major concern is that i don't see many ways out of this where none of us end up hurt in some way... either my friend and i will likely end up bitter towards the other. i feel like i'd be ok getting over it and i wouldn't care about it within a couple weeks, but i'm not sure if he would feel the same way.\n\n \n\nedit: typos and such\n [OUT] ",

mention that i'm traveling the philippines, and that i have done so for 4 weeks. i'm from denmark and started out traveling alone, but i have met a german guy, that i have been traveling with since. he is cool and we are pretty similar in a lot of ways. sorry, i'll get to the fuck-up: \n\nafter a long day of driving around on motorbikes, we really just wanted to relax for a bit. we stay in a small shitty hotel because we travel on a budget, so ofc they don't have a pool. earlier the same day, we walked past this big 5-star resort with the most amazing swimming pool, which of course, we now wanted to try out. we stopped 50 meters before the hotel, just to agree how we would approach this. the hotel was full of people, so we wouldn't have to worry about being spotted and thrown out, since they couldn't possibly know all the people staying there. we would walk into the pool area from the beach, and say hello to the only security guard they had patrolling. so that was what we did. we smiled over-politely, and said hi to every employee we met, just to seem like we were happy hotel guests. we got in, and jumped straight into the pool. we swam around for a bit enjoying this expensive place we just crashed. we started talking about ordering a couple of drinks from the poolbar they had. you know, one of does where you sit in the pool and the bar at the same time. you get the idea. sorry for my english. anyway, since we didn't know what the normal procedure was for ordering (room cards, room number or cash), we decided to let one of us find out. i lost a quick little swim-off, and went for the bar. i ordered 2 beers and they asked for a room number. i was prepared, so i just told them i would like to pay straight up, because that was easier for me to handle. that wasn't a problem, so we sat down in the bar and started drinking. we started talking to this russian guy whom we quickly got pretty tired of. he was cocky af, and kept on bragging about money and he's amazing career. we wasn't sure he was telling the truth, but either way, he quickly became boring to listen to. he luckily took off, and we continued our speed drinking. at this point, we had been sitting in the bar for 1 hour, 50 minutes into happy hour, and we had already had 2 beers and 2 long islands each. we were getting pissed way to quickly. we started playing around with my gopro which i only bought, because i wanted to use it for my journey. we took a lot of goofy underwater pictures, and where having a laugh about it. after 3 more long islands each, we had been in the bar for 2 hours, and only paid for the 2 first beers. we were fucking drunk and started discussing politics, and all that other stupid stuff you discuss when you are drunk. just before happy hour ended, chris, the german, ordered one more long island for us each. we were, as i said, crazy drunk, so we thought it would be a good idea to put it all on a room, instead of paying ourselves. chris had overheard the room number from the russian douche, and we knew he would be leaving the day after, so what the heck, we put it on his tab. the staff luckily didn't remember his room number, so they did it without problems. we drank the long islands chris ordered, and here the switch flicks. blackout, can't remember shit after that. i wake up the next morning, alone in our shitty hotel room. i thought that chris probably already woke up, and went for something to eat. i totally forgot that i was supposed to go diving, so i quickly pack my things and rushes out the door, with only 15 minutes before the boat leaves. here i meet chris, and this random, kinda tough looking philippino. chris asks me for 2000 pesos (roughly 50 bucks), and tells me he needs to pay off the police. i go what the fuck and asks for the story, since i don't remember shit. he tells me that there is no time, and that he will tell the story later. i give him the 2000, and runs down to the dive center. after picking out me scuba gear, i wanted to have a quick cigarette before leaving with the boat to go diving. this is where i realise that neither my cigarettes or my fucking gopro is in my bag. i always use the gopro for diving, so i really felt like i needed it. i tell the divemaster, that i will just quickly run to my room and find it. i run back to my room but can't find it. i'm exhausted from being hungover and in 35 degrees of heat, but i'm now convinced that it must still be in the bar we got drunk in, since i remember using it there. i run to the resort, to ask for it, but the bar hasn't opened yet, and the security guard wasn't on shift the night before, so he just tells me to come back later. he asks for my room number so i tell him the russians number and runs back. i just managed to make it before the boats leaves, and goes diving in some of the best waters i ever dived in. after seeing 10 big seaturtles i really miss my gopro even more. as we come back from the dive, i go straight for the resort, to ask for the gopro again. the bartender from the night before was there. i tell him that i don't remember shit, and that my gopro is gone. he laughs at me, and tells me that both me and my friend was so drunk that he was kinda surprised to see me being able to actually walk home alone. so now i at least know that i walked home alone, and i then proceed to ask about chris and the gopro. he tells me that one of the other bartenders gave the gopro to chris while i was still there, and that chris sat back alone when i left. equally drunk, he ate several plates of fries. i'm relieved and sure, that chris had the camera. i walk back to our hotel. chris is laying in his bed, and starts laughing when i walk in. \"what happened last night?!\" he asks. we start to talk about it, and realise that our memories both blacked out at the exact same time. he tells me that he woke up in a prison cell the same morning, which i think is fucking funny! he had no idea how he got there, but the officers tells him that he broke a window. they were pretty chill about it, so he knew that the situation wasn't that bad. we laugh about it, and he shows me a bunch of selfies he took in the cell the night before. still laughing, i ask him where he has my gopro, and he looks weird at me. he doesn't have it. all my pictures and movies, and the expensive camera i worked hard to save up for, is still gone.... we go back to the resort to try and figure out where the camera is, and what the fuck happened the night before. at this point, i feel like we are almost reenacting a part of the hangover movies. we decide to go for the reception to ask about the camera there as well. they haven't seen it, but would like to check in their lost and found. i thank the receptionist, but gets even more nervous when she ask for our room number. \"oh, we already checked out\", we said. she still wants it, so again, we give the russians room number. i'm sure that she will now realise that we never stayed at the hotel, but she doesn't, even though she looked the room up on her screen. unluckily the lost and found hadn't received a gopro. we thank her again and turns around to go home. here, we meet a piccolo, who greets chris. he tells us that chris came to the other pool alone later that night. the other pool is located 150 meter from the pool we started in, and that he was so

(i'm not using being drunk or high as an excuse for any of this at all i want to be very clear on that because they are some of my favorite things.) \n\nwhen i said \"go out and have sex with someone else when i didn't want to\" i thought i meant it. we have a recurring fight all based around sex. sometimes when i don't want to he will get very upset with me and he will start asking why he can't go have sex with someone else if i'm not going to have sex with him. i always felt/feel worthless and like a terrible person for putting him through that because i don't want that. i don't want to go have sex with other people when he doesn't so why am i not enough for him? sidetracked, sorry. sometimes i would cave and we would end up having sex but sometimes i don't and the fight can last for days. so if making him happy meant telling him that he could have sex with other people than that made me happy. i did tell him though that if he was going to do it to make sure i would never find out or i would be super pissed. so i fucked that up big time because he called my bluff.\n\ni found out about one. i don't know if there were any others and honestly me being ignorant to that fact is fine. the thing that bothered me most about this person was she was his coworker (she actually worked a under him... pun certainly intended) the sheer stupidity of this made me angry. i say \"was\" his coworker because they have both been suspended for their relationship, and my husband is 99% sure they are both getting fired. i found out about the relationship before the suspension. i did not say anything to anyone about it. i thought my husband might question me about that. however, he knew i didn't say anything to his company because he already knew the girl had said something to at least two other co-workers. i went on a tirade of insults directed at her. mostly about \"how could she be so stupid as to say anything to anyone about it?! is she special? does she think that this is high school and all her little girlfriends want to hear about it?\" and so on and so forth and things of that nature. until i realized this is my fault for not being honest with my husband and i didn't really have a right to attack he. maybe a little bit. fucking dumbasses.\n\ni feel like my entire life is in the midst of coming to a screeching hault. in horribly slow motion. i just bought a car. we have been talking about having kids for ages. now i'm pondering how we are going to afford anything. i do have a ft job as well but doesn't pay nearly what his does/did. i honestly thought that i would be ok with it if he ever did have sex with someone else and i found out. like a one night stand. i never thought it would fuck things up on this big of a scale. \n\nso i feel guilty, angry, sad, embarrassed and just fucked all at the same time. there are moments that i'm fine and then there are times i just break down and cry. i'm handling this poorly. i can't sleep right or eat right. a couple very bad thoughts have entered and exited my brain. i've consumed so much alcohol and weed in the last 48-72 hours just to feel better but then i don't anyway. i didn't drink today but i am wide awake and its roughly 130am est. i should have been asleep hours ago for work. \n\ni decided to watch lotr rotk and write about all this.\n\nwe have been having amazing sex the last couple days too though which is great but i'm so afraid of what's gonna happen when the whole shock of everything finally sinks in. so this evening after our second romp he told me how much better he felt and asked me if i felt better and i said \"i'm ok\". i do kind of feel better but i'm afraid its only temporary.\n\nso that is about all. if anyone wants to just contribute or give advise its totally welcome.

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: on the back side of my house, facing northwest, there are three large plate-glass windows. the family room has a two-story ceiling, so the three windows are about 9ft (3m) off of ground level. \n\nat certain points in the year, when the earth has revolved around the sun to the correct position and has tilted on its axis to the proper degree, the windows act like mirrors from the outside and reflect the image of the trees back. this causes a lot of confusion in the avian wildlife surrounding my home, leading to frequent strikes against the glass. most often by doves, the \"high-class\" pigeon. \n\noccasionally, the doves will strike with force and angle enough to cause them a quick, and one would hope painless, death. but this tends to leave bird corpses under the windows, and i'll sometimes find myself removing them from the backyard and disposing of them in the trash. \n\nsurprisingly enough, most of the birds actually survive these strikes and take off again a few moments later, stunned but generally no worse for the wear. well, seasons come and seasons pass, and the earth has once again reached the magical zone that i've not-so-affectionally dubbed \"bird-strike season\". it will last until roughly november, and all the while my house will do its duty in thinning the local dove population.\n\n\nnow, having set up the background, the bird strikes have begun again. few at first, then gaining in frequency as the season progresses. the first few happened last week. no fatalities, i thought, likely because the angle isn't quite right and they're not hitting head-on. until last night. my wife came out to me, while i was mowing the back lawn, and tells me, \"hey, there's a dead bird in the gutter over the porch. you need to get it out.\" no problem, i've done dead bird removal a dozen or more times by now, but i couldn't for the life of me recall the bird actually hitting the window. then it hit me, like a bird to the glass.\n\nwe had a few strikes last week. \n\none of them i heard the body hit the ground after the initial strike. i went looking for it but i couldn't find it, so i had assumed (incorrectly) that it had just been stunned and flown away. that must be the one in the gutter. \n\nin central texas. \n\nin september.\n\nin 90+ degree (32c) heat. \n\nfor a week.\n\nok. i hoped that maybe, because there really just isn't a lot of mass to a bird, that it would be alright. i wanted to go on a motorcycle ride this weekend, because my wife is working tomorrow. with that in mind, i have been trying to knock out some of the \"honey-do\" list. bird removal was on that list as of last night. \n\ni went to the garage this morning, grabbed the ladder and my gloves, and went outside. i set up the ladder next to the rain gutter, where the bird had fallen, and ascended the ladder to retrieve it. when i got to the top of the ladder, i knew i was in for a bad time. first, there was the smell. death has a smell. every animal alive knows the smell of death. it's ingrained in our subconscious, and we all instinctively try to avoid it. but when it's... moist... the smell really has a chance to do it's magic. \n\nok, i'm an adult, i can power through this. it's just a dead bird. \n\nso i gingerly take hold of the wing and lift the corpse to freedom. well, that was the plan, anyway.\n\nsee, the issue with dead things out in the summer heat is that they tend to not stay whole. the same goes true for this bird.\nas i lifted the wing, i came to the stark realization that this was not a bird. not anymore. it was a mound of greyish sludge, writhing with fat maggots, in the shape of what used to be a bird. well damn. ok, lifing the bird out of there was just not happening. not if i wanted to keep down my breakfast, which already threatened to make a reappearance. i had to come up with a new plan. a water hose. i could just flush it out. it was, after all, in a rain gutter. armed with my new and brilliant idea, i fetched the garden hose from the side of the house, hooked it up to the spigot in the back, and dragged it up the ladder. i climbed down and turned on the water, then headed back up to make sure i got everything.\n\nwhen i squeezed the lever on the nozzle, i knew i had made a mistake. \n\nyou see, rain gutters aren't terribly deep. they're these shallow little aluminum troths that are just designed to funnel water off of the roof and away from the house. they're not really designed to soak the impact of a full pressure stream of a garden hose. \n\nif you've ever done the dishes, you'll know full well what i'm about to describe. after breakfast, you're cleaning out your cereal bowl, you've rinsed it and maybe loaded it into the dishwasher. then you move on to the spoon. not paying much attention, you casually place the spoon under the running faucet. and proceed to get completely soaked. the rain gutter acted much like a spoon under a faucet. it redirected a great quantity of water right back at me. and since i was on a ladder, standing with just my chin above the roof level, it had only one place to hit me. the face. oh, and i mentioned there was a rotting, maggot-filled bird there, right? because that's important to this next part. with the water, came just about everything else in the gutter. \n\nat my face. \n\nthis morning for breakfast, i had a bagel, lightly toasted with cream cheese, raspberry lemonade, and two eggs, scrambled. \n\n\nas the foul sludge hit my face, my breakfast decided it had enough of this and was vacating the premises post haste. so now i'm standing on a ladder, vomiting all over myself, covered in rotting dove and wriggling maggots, and completely soaking wet.\n\ni decided the best course of action at this point would be to bail out. i left the ladder in one fell swoop, doing a great tuck and roll into the backyard. i've mentioned before that i've got a dog, right? well, apparently, she'd been outside not long before i'd decided to clean out the gutter. as i slid to a stop, i came to the conclusion that i had shoulder rolled right through a dog turd. \n\nfantastic.\n\ni threw down the hose, stripped off my shirt, left my shoes on the back porch, and headed for the shower. \n\nbecause fuck this morning.\n [OUT] ",

(*later over text, she told me that staying at 7 eleven wouldn’t have counted as repayment). she said she tried to argue for keeping me, but she couldn’t win because i caused such a big loss. (i doubt my weak-ass emotions were a redeeming quality.) asst. manager also said that my mistakes were technically theft, so loss prevention could potentially decide to prosecute me. she thought prosecution was unlikely with my inexperience being such a big factor. i returned my uniform and hope that i didn't seem to have criminal intent. i did break the law and break someone’s bank. i don’t think authorities have to care whether i did it on purpose or not. it was bad and it probably looked bad. \n\ni have no clue what to do. what do i tell my parents, who gave me all this job advice i didn’t write down like they told me to? \n\nwhat do i tell the apartment staff, or the people interested in my room? what do i say to my roommates?\n \nwhat do i about my weekend job when i already put in my weeks-notice?\n \nam i going to jail? what’s the likelihood of legal trouble and how do i deal with it?\n\n**tl;dr–** fired from gas station after 3 days b/c i was dumb & didn’t remember to scan every single lotto ticket that i pulled out to sell -> big profit loss. whether loss prevention will prosecute me tbd.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: so this actually happened a couple of years ago- i hope you find my tale of woe entertaining, however.\n\nbackground: i live on the us west coast. i was attending a week-long conference for the industry i work in, which was held in new york. this happened at the end of the week as i was returning home. after a week of attending conference and training sessions during the day and mixers and a couple of parties in the evenings, i was pretty well tired and ready to go home. also, maybe a little dehydrated.\n\ni got to the airport and headed straight for my gate, made it through security faster than usual, which was nice. i grabbed a sandwich at some deli counter near my gate and boarded. i figured i'd wolf down my sandwich, put on my neck pillow  and try to get some sleep- which is hard for me because at six-four i can never get comfortable in those stupid seats, but i was going to try.\n\njust as i finished wolfing down the sandwich, a drop of blood lands on the paper. *great*, i thought- *a nosebleed, just what i need.* i figured i'd just tip my head back and hold my nose like i usually do on the very rare occasions i get nosebleeds. or maybe put a little bit of a napkin in my nose for a few minutes.\n\nbut this one isn't stopping. i can feel blood running down the back of my throat (a sensation i do not recommend). i tip my head forward to look down for a napkin and a few cc's of blood dribbles into the paper my sandwich was wrapped in.\n\nnow a bit worried, i grabbed all the napkins in a bunch, crammed them over my nose and got up. i was in a window seat so 2 people next to me had to move. since we were only a few rows from the back, i went straight to the rear lavatory. i got in and thought i'd wash my face off and use direct pressure with some fresh napkins or something and get the bleeding to stop.\n\nnothing doing. as soon as i looked down into the sink, i sort of choked and coughed- and at least a quarter cup of blood poured out of my mouth into that little sink they have in those things.\n\ni will never forget that image. bright red blood pooled up in the bottom of that tiny metal bowl, and my eyes watering making the image all shimmery. it was oddly beautiful, but i was also freaking the hell out.\n\ni opened the door and got the attention of a stewardess. she tried to help for a moment, but then said \"you'll have to leave the plane. even if we get this stopped, the clot will break as soon as we get to altitude.\"\n\nby this point the plane was only a few minutes from its scheduled takeoff and they were going through the pre-flight procedures- showing people how to use the oxygen masks and so on.\n\ni was pleading with this woman to help me out- i most assuredly didn't want to have to change all my scheduled plans. i also figured that if they booted me that they wouldn't give me an opportunity to take a later flight without buying another ticket, and i had budgeted for this trip a year in advance, so it wasn't like i could easily afford another cross-country airfare.\n\nhowever, my bleeding had gotten a lot worse by this point. i was told (i don't remember by who) not to tip my head back because if i swallowed too much blood it'd make me sick and that'd be even worse than what was happening so far.\n\nby now there was probably a cup of blood in the sink, and while we had managed to avoid getting it on other surfaces or on other people, there was piles of red-soaked napkins and paper towels everywhere.\n\nnow the flight attendant was looking kind of freaked out- this was not stopping.\n\ndid you know that they actually *do* get on the intercom and ask for a doctor? i thought that was only in movies and books. i almost laughed at the absurdity of it all.\n\ni was starting to get really worried and was ready to disembark, maybe the airline would have some kind of medical emergency provision or something, because i didn't want to bleed to death in the back of a jetliner. \n\nbut how would i get out without bleeding on everyone all the way down the aisle? by this point i was having to spit/cough out a mouthful of blood every twenty seconds or so. i had blood on my face, in my beard- trust me, you never want dried blood in your beard- and i was really freaking out.\n\nthe other passengers near the back were by and large quite calm. nobody gave me the stinkeye, for which i was grateful, and no one tried to offer advice. there were some looks here and there.\n\nthe captain said over the intercom that there'd be a slight delay, and just then a guy came to the back- a younger guy, dressed like he was coming back from a hike or day trip.\n\nturned out we was a nurse. he was returning from, i believe, africa- where he'd been doing medical work with some folks out there.\n\nthis guy was amazing. he talked down the flight attendant fast, who was ready to throw me off the plane bodily, and went to work. he snapped on a pair of latex gloves, poked around my face a little, and within about two minutes he had the bleeding under control, then stopped within about ten minutes, by packing my nose with gauze from the medical kit at the back and very calmly just handling his business. it was actually amazing to watch him work.\n\na few minutes later, he told the flight attendant i'd be fine to fly- the packing would handle it and the pressure wouldn't be a factor- and gave me some tips about how to take care of it when i got home (mostly just leave it for long enough, then take it out carefully using warm water to loosen it if necessary).\n\ni will forever be grateful to him- a nice guy in the right place who knew what he was doing and took care of business.\n\nby now it was only about ten minutes past our scheduled departure time. but then... they had to get a biohazard/hazmat team- or at least a bunch of people wearing plastic suits, gloves and masks- to clean up everything in the back and make sure all the surfaces were sterilized. they came down the aisle of the plane in gloves and with facemasks, and the passengers forward of us were a bit freaked out, obviously. they also had to replace the medical kit, and get paperwork certifying all the supplies used had been replaced, then it had to be sealed and signed off on, so more people in and out of the plane, up and down the aisles.\n\nand as each of these steps went on, the captain treated us to a status update over the intercom. he was very nice about it, but every time he said something like \"we just have to wait a few more minutes for some paperwork about the first-aid kit, folks. they're bringing it now\", and so on- i sunk a little lower in my seat.\n\nby the time we actually took off, it was well over an hour past our scheduled departure time. i spent the flight with a scarf around my eyes as a makeshift blindfold, trying to sleep to avoid the punishing gaze of my fellow travelers- which may not have even existed, but i was so embarrassed that even when we landed i waited until almost everyone else was off the plane so i could exit without having to look at everyone who i'd managed to delay.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: firstly, as weird as it sounds, i've weirdly always wanted to be able to post a tifu, so that's one thing crossed off the bucket list. also obligatory \"this was yesterday\" etc etc\n\nto set the scene, i know this girl very little, she followed me on twitter a while ago and seemed very flirty, but that wasn't unusual for the kind of fangirl i've seen on twitter and she seemed to be in that category so i thought nothing of it. i know her to be a 15 year old american white girl, but on the internet who the hell knows... after seeing her follow me on twitter and reading a few messages about how i'm funny and cool (humble brag) she messaged me a fair few times on a teamspeak server after realizing i hang out there a little, mainly spam messaging me random crap about her wanting to talk to me & i didn't get much of a chance to respond because i was a little busy most of the time.\n\ni also do some programming for a minecraft server and after she started building for the same server we were in a skype chat together and so i eventually accepted her request and sometimes i'd reply to our messages, just so i didn't seem like a douche who was ignoring her.\n\nthe first red flag should have been that she asked to be moved into a private room with me on the teamspeak and burst out crying because i hadn't replied to her last 2 messages. at this point i made up some excuse, said i can't reply to every message everyone sends me, then resumed my conversation in the channel i was in previously.\n\nshe then sends me more messages on teamspeak and complains about how i don't talk to her enough, which i end up ignoring, because i don't know quite what to say and i quite bored of her shit at this point. i could tell she was in a bad mood because she used full stops (periods for americans). when fangirls use full stops, it's almost only when they're pissed off. she was definitely pissed off.\n\nshe continues to be clingy and i talk to her very little, but when i do she seems very infatuated for one reason or anything. now, i didn't think acting flirty is out of the ordinary and i without realising casually flirt with most people anyway, so i might have done with her a little bit, but everything has always been completely harmless with no implication of any desire for a relationship or intimacy, plus she has heard me flirt with other people many times.\n\nfast forward to saturday and the fuck up starts properly. i've been in hospital, where the port for skype is blocked on the normal wifi. so thanks to another hotspot i get on proper free wifi and load up skype. she sees me type in a group chat we're both in and messages me telling me how worried she is about me and how she's so worried that she's gonna book plane tickets to come and see me. she lives in north carolina and i live in england, so the flight would take a total of 11 hours with a lot of layover time and she said she was spending $2,600 on the flight alone, without thinking about accommodation and all of that.\n\nbefore i continue, i should explain that during the following conversation i was on quite heavy sedatives and other drugs and as a few of my friends who've spoken to me and seen me while i'm on these drugs, i'm not myself and i'm not fully aware of what's happening.\n\ni was convinced this was an elaborate joke for a while and was both weirded out (a lot), confused at why someone would do this but also very flattered at the same time. i did tell her that i had a lot of concerns about her flying on her own, coming here where there are no hotels nearby with no adult travelling alongside her, especially as the area the hospital is in is a little rough. this was all after she booked the tickets, she didn't give me a chance to say anything about it apart from something along the lines of \"holy shit why would you do that?\" before she spent this ridiculous amount of money. she also then told me she loved me, to which i didn't quite know how to respond.\n\ni also told her how i really appreciated the sentiment and she was very generous, but the fuck up was that i didn't say no. i didn't say yes either, but since i was being nice to her (even though i did say what the fuck a lot) i don't think she took that as a \"don't come\". she did say that i should let her know before monday if i wanted her to refund the tickets, so the next morning when i woke up and realised what had happened i messaged her and in the nicest way possible said \"look, you've been really nice and i appreciate it but i don't really know you and it's quite creepy and weird\".\n\nwhat i didn't understand is that when she said i could tell her to refund everything then she would freak out and start to hate me. once i got on proper wifi again yesterday evening i hopped on the teamspeak channel we've spoken to each other on to speak to some other people and she did her usual spam message thing. this time i actually spoke to her, in voice, reiterating my point and explaining why she really can't come. i felt pretty damn guilty because she was crying the whole way through, but i didn't ask her or encourage her to book the tickets so i'd like to think i handled it as best as i could.\n\nexplaining this to my parents and the nurses was fun and they'll forever take the piss, because it sounds like i made everything up when i tried to explain \"a 15 year old girl from twitter is on a plane from america because she said she loves me and wants to check i'm okay.\". to be fair i wouldn't let anyone live it down either, so i don't blame them, but i was a little freaked out and didn't know what to do because it's quite a surreal position to be in.\n\nanyway, the end result is that anyone who visits me has to know my last name before being allowed in (which she doesn't) and the senior sister (person in charge of the whole ward) is on today so if she does turn up, or a 40 year old man turns up in her absence, she'll help deal with the situation alongside security. i doubt anyone will turn up but i'd rather be safe, because this girl is creepy enough on the internet so i can't bear to think what she'd be like in real life.\n\nplease excuse any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors, i'm on drugs now, just thankfully not as strong as the ones i was on for friday & saturday.\n\n \n\nedit: removed 1 personal detail just to be safe i'm not breaking the rules\n\nedit 2: i should've mentioned i'm 17, so thankfully no jail sentence for me either way.\n\nupdate @ monday 11pm gmt: if a guy said he'd stuck his dick in a toaster while his wife gave birth to a piglet then you'd all believe him but this seems a little difficult to add up, which is i guess fair enough because it's all very surreal.\n\nanyway, she dmed me today (i don't know how someone can do that after i've unfollowed them and blocked them, nice one twitter) and basically said \"fuck you\". i assume that's code for \"i didn't come after all\". she's also seen this post so that hasn't made her more fond of me, but i expected that since mutual friends have seen it.\n\nunfortunately this is all now very anticlimactic and the best part of this is the bit that none of you could see, the faces of everyone i mentioned it to. however it is now a running joke & the nurses here are poking fun at me for it, i don't think it'll go away for a while given the initial reaction i had to it all, but now i can laugh about it at least because she didn't come.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: so this happened about 10 years ago give or take. at the time i had developed a stye on my upper eye lid. for those that have never had one, it basically makes your eye look like all puffy and swollen, sort of like someone decided to swing at you and you blocked with your eye. the crappy part about it was that i did not treat my eye and it did shrink, but it left a hardened mass that was quite obvious. since i was a server at the time it made for quite an awkward interaction with many of the guests that would come into the restaurant. eventually, my health insurance kicked in and i was able to take care of it via minor surgery. so i eagerly set an appointment a month out and waited.\n\nin the meantime i met a woman at a coffee shop. we'll call her sara since that is about the most generic name i can think of at the moment. she was funny, beautiful and i had a blast talking to her. we joked about the strange little lump on my eyelid, exchanged phone numbers and i called her a couple times, eventually setting up a date.\n\nthe thing about being a 22 year old male, and specifically about me being a 22 year old male was that i was a bit over confident, still awkward, and very much forgetful. so i was disappointed when i got the reminder call for my eyelid surgery the night before my date. not wanting to lose out on a chance with sara, i was delighted to hear that the surgery was just a quick 45 minute in and out a couple hours before my date, no pain involved due to anesthetics and no real recovery aside from an eye patch. my mind started whirring. sara said she found pirates sexy. pirates wear eye patches. i'll wear an eye patch. therefore sara will find me sexy. perfect.\n\ni immediately decided to call sara and confirm what time we were meeting up. the conversation went as follows (to the best of my memory):\n\nme: hey sara, we still on to get coffee tomorrow?\n\nsara: absolutely! 2pm still good?\n\nme: sure thing, i should be out of my surgery by about 11. i can pick you up around 2.\n\nsara: .... surgery? you want to reschedule?\n\nme: (cue my overconfidence) nah. it'll be okay. quick in and out thing.\n\nthe surgery went as smooth as can be. it was slightly disturbing being totally awake and knowing they were doing things to my eyelid but not being able to feel it, but that's not the point of this story. the point of this story is that modern medicine while more successful than the medical practices of 17th century europe, does not take aesthetics into account at all. while anticipating receiving my badass pirate eye patch i was disappointed to see that in reality it was nothing more than a lump of white gauze taped to my face, slightly stained by what might have been iodine. the skin visible behind this monstrosity of fashion was also tinted yellow from either bruising or iodine, i don't know, i'm not a doctor.\n\nreddit, i could have called her then and sheepishly requested a reschedule, but no, i was man. man don't back down. man go forth! i quickly realized how differently your experience of the world is when you don't have the use of two eyes. the world being now 2d is very hard to navigate. i called my dad to come pick me up, because driving was out of the question. he looked at me like i was an idiot when i mentioned i was meeting sara in a couple hours, but he wasn't about to let me pass up the opportunity for learning from my mistakes. he shrugged and said, \"okay son, whatever\".\n\nat home i decided i'd better call sara and ask her to pick me up since i was no longer able to pick her up. she did of course because she was a sweet heart. \n\nthe date went as follows:\n\nfirst, the look of utter confusion on her face at the mass of cotton, tape and yellow stains that occupied my face.\n\nsecond, there is a sudden realization that the simplest of tasks are impossible to accomplish when your used to having two working eyes. when i reached out for my cup of coffee it was with great determination and slowness, since i had no idea where my hand was in relation to the cup. when i came to curbs i had to stop dead in my tracks and slowly lower my foot to the street. she had to hold my arm and guide me down the street if there were many obstacles. when i tried to hug her hello and good bye it was also this weird slow deliberate movement because again, depth perception is important. basically every movement i made was akin to how i would imagine sloths live their lives.\n\nshe never said anything, bless her heart, but the look of embarrassment and confusion on why i insisted on not rescheduling is one of the memories of her that sticks with me to this day. instead of looking badass and sexy, i looked like someone who just got out of surgery for a massive head wound and she was the kind soul to take me out and show me the world outside of the hospital.\n\ndespite this horrible lapse in judgement, i actually did get another date or two, but that didn't stop me from doing equally stupid things, so eventually she did decide she was done and moved on. we remained friends after that however and i got a good story out of it, so that's nice i suppose.\n [OUT] ",

it's not like i have proof that i did. so i searched my house in case i didn't hand it in and was remembering wrong. but it wasn't anywhere to be found.\n\ntbh i'm pretty sure they lost it, not me. i remember i kept it in my binder at the start of the school year. i hardly ever pull out my binder at school; the school uses laptops for most work. if i placed it at home, well i searched pretty thoroughly in my room, it would have to be in a completely nonsensical place for me not to have found it by then.\n\nso i went to the public school i volunteered at. i thought it would be super simple. all they'd need to do is pull up a record of who volunteered last year, or find someone who remembered me.\n\nbut they had no idea who even led the program the previous year. i unfortunately didn't remember a name either. the office had to ask a bunch of random people and in the end got some person i didn't recognize who supposedly led the program when i volunteered (i was bad with faces and she had a generic look). they said they weren't sure if the event kept the records on who volunteered. or that it was just really hard to find the records or something. they didn't recognize me, and asked for my contact info for when they found record of me.\n\nthey didn't. i went back a week later and they had no recollection of me being there. i was able to get the email of the program leader, who apparently wasn't there that day, and emailed her.\n\nshe said she never knew about anyone coming in asking for her, so i have no idea who the hell i spoke to my first visit.\n\ndespite me mentioning in the first email that i volunteered on weeks 5 and 6 of the program, it took a bunch of replies for her to finally say that she only managed the first three weeks of the program, and another person managed the last three. i got the other program leader's email, and emailed her 2 weeks ago, but she hasn't responded. i gave her another email recently, and also emailed the first program leader again, who's now given me a number to leave a voicemail.\n\nworst of all, my mother who doesn't understand anything about social interactions much less business interactions or the likes, and hasn't had a job for a decade or two, thinks i should just call it quits and redo my 40h. which would be a fine idea, but for some god damn reason she thinks by this summer it'll be too late or something, and wants me to do it during the school year.\n\nshe seemed to completely forget what a nightmare it was to find any volunteer opportunities, much less getting the position when you found one. not to mention the hour or two of training everything that wasn't shady af took for every individual job. nor the $30 police check needed for most jobs. seriously, the summer camp thingy was a gift from the heavens. i could easily do it again.  comparatively easy.\n\ni have some proof i did volunteer work there. i should be able to find the t-shirt they gave as uniform if i look hard enough, and i found emails from that year of them accepting me. tbh i don't even know why they need to confirm whether i actually volunteered there or not. their offer for positions is kind of hard to find, i have a t-shirt they only hand out to volunteers, i have an email correspondence from then that shows i accepted the position, and i literally did the minimum amount of hours you were allowed to do, it's not like they need to check whether i'm saying i did more than i actually did. i should also be able to contact one other volunteer that worked at the same time i did for proof, if that helps at all. in fact, i have a video or two i took during my hours, but i'm pretty sure there're rules about videos in schools, so i'm going to use that as a last resort.\n [OUT] ",

(meaning the brakes weren't in park) so there i am trying to hold a 27,000 lb truck from rolling any farther. i am a large guy but there is no stopping a huge truck from rolling. during all this, all the alignment sensors and sensor holders are smashing and busting into hundreds of peices. i have everyone in the shop running over yelling at me to get out of the way and to let it roll. my boss had managed to run over and jump in the truck and set the brakes real quick before it crashed through the door. \nall in all, i broke all the sensors to the only alignment equipment we have and we use it every day. we have over 5,000 trucks in the fleet. the sensors and the holding racks cost nearly $10,000. that's not including the program to be updated when we get the new alignment equipment. may or may not lose my job tomorrow. i'm really hoping for the best... \n\n \n\nupdate: heading into work now, will let everyone know how it goes. either on my first break, lunch or if they tell me to leave. lol thanks to everyone for the encouragement and kind words. i hope it all goes well. can't be getting fired before the holidays lol \n\nupdate 2: came into work and everything was normal. kinda... everyone kept asking what happened last night and everyone kept looking at me weird but also thanking me because we get a new machine. so word was spread pretty quick to first shift. but that being said... i still have my job. machine is covered by insurance and will be getting new and much updated machine next week. we had a safety meeting on what we need to do from now on and we have changed how we are setting up the alignment process. so all in all, everything is all well. didn't get a slap on the wrist either just was told to get out of the way instead of jumping in front of a large semi to stop it. i guess i'm no superman after all. thank you all for the encouragement and helpful tips. ps. i know now it's chock not chalk. 😂😂😂😂😊😊\n [OUT] ",

because she expects you to entertain grandpa till she gets back in 2-3 hours..everytime! oh she knows you were supposed to arrive at whatever time too..she chooses to do this to us all. i dont mind helping as i know they need it but they have systematically driven my family, my cousins and i insane with constantly calling us for mundane things. its mostly because they are lonely. but you see, they live in a retirement village of like 10,000 homes..they wont make friends with anyone..for whatever reason.. my entire family basically wont help her anymore except for my mom.\n\nanyways onto the fuck up: for the past year our summer cabin has needed a new floor. it got some water damage and since we all have been super busy the last few years the floor sorta got wet and it basically needed to be replaced in one spot. since my grandparents own it, i informed them of this. i was told several times to just leave it alone. this happened like a year ago. i mentioned several times but every time was met with resistance. its not like im incapable either, i woulda fixed it myself and let it be but they wouldnt have it.\n\nso fast forward to around may of this year. they beg me to take them out there and i do so. they tell me to drive their car as my truck gets way less mpg. the entire ride my grandfather is crying about how im beating the poor car (its not old and its in very good shape) and to drive slower (its a 3 hour ride one way ffs! i was doing the speed limit (65mph but everyone does like 80mph on said hwy) and following the rest of the traffic. okay i let it go, he is an old crotchety man and isnt quite with it anymore. so we go and we see the floor and cleanup the house a bit. i tell them again ill fix it and grandma relents i can do it. but i tell them it wont be asap as i have things to do in the next few weeks.\n\non the way back again grandpa crys about my driving and this time i tell him if he doesnt like it he can get out and walk (we're still 2 hours from home now) and he shuts up and grandma yells at him. for the record i drive for a living, trust me i wasnt driving obnoxiously or recklessly at all. the car is a 4cyl and anyone who has driven one on the highway knows you need to give it a good bit of gas to pass another vehicle, it isnt a v8. grandpa didnt like me accelerating so hard i guess.\n\nok (sorry this is so long btw): finally we come to the fact my grandmother has called me every week 2-3x a week to make a date to take them out again so they can watch me repair it (not happening i dont have time for this bs, if i take them it will take 3 weeks to fix it because they will bother me and i will have to get them every time i go). i tell her ill pay for the materials i need and will go and get it done, no no i have to take them with. my mother winds up taking them after grandma hounded me and i basically told her i couldnt b/c of work schedule. turns out what my grandmother didnt mention to my mom was that she needed to go there b/c she contacted a contractor to pay to fix it! they arrived and my mom is annoyed she didnt mention this cause the guy is already there waiting for them to open the door so he can fix it. my mom wasnt happy grandma lied to her.\n\non the ride there my mom laid into them to leave us all alone, she is constantly calling my brother, cousins, i, my parents for mundane things and we are busy as we all work full time jobs. if she needs help we cant come rfn we will come when we can and to setup a time and day. grandma didnt like that.\n\nso heres the real fuck up: i havent spoken to my grandmother in 2 months. i have avoided her purposely as she really pissed me off. she calls my cell tonight and starts in about what my work schedule is and can i take them to pay the contractor (who i found out we know personally and would take a damn check in the mail!). i tell her im busy and she begs me and that was it,i lost it. i laid into her about the bs with driving their car so were taking my truck and i will drive 100mph if i wish, how i told them for over a yea the floor needed to be fixed and offered and she refused and how she is driving me crazy. she was so shocked she told me that no my grandfather never said i was driving poorly and when i countered she told me to shove it and hung up on me.\n [OUT] ",

'gas' i thought, nbd. unfortunately after lunch on my way back to work, and thankfully after saying goodbye to my lunchdate, i try to relieve some of the pressure by taking a much needed fart. instead of relief i realized in horror that a solid glop of liquid shit had come out. i immediately half stand up in my truck, as i am wearing my overcoat, i pull it up, sit back down thinking i had saved it, then remembered my truck seats are fabric. in desperation i pull over a gift bag i have in my truck from transporting christmas presents, pull the gift out (it really was nicely wrapped) and shove the bag under my ass praying the cause of the putrid smell in my truck hadnt yet seeped through. \n\ni immediately begin gunning my truck back to my apartment, about five minutes away from where i work (lucky), swing into the lot, ever feeling the shit keep dripping from my ass, for some reason i couldnt stop the flow, and god my intestines were about to make me scream. as i hurredly park my truck, get out, and remove my overcoat, i can feel gritty feel of the shit particles in my pants chafing, and in horror i look at the bag which had been under me and there is no sign of the liquid. i run upstairs, barge in on my roomate, run into the bathroom, and promptly step in dog piss as he hadnt let his dog out recently. \n\ni sit down on the toilet, without even closing the door, and begin spraying a disgusting, green stream of shite, groaning and bemoaning my fate. i shrug out of the pants as fast and best i could, and figure out where the liquid had gone. almost the entire back of my pants was tinged brown green.\n\nso, here i am, desperately pissing a stream of shit from my ass, looking at my favorite pair of now ruined jeans, and what used to be my lucky boxers, groaning as my intestines try to tear themselves out of my body, and my boss texts me to ask where the fuck i am and inquire why i am not at work. 'sorry, shoe broke, be back in a jiff' is the only response i could think of. \n\n i stand up eventually, nearly puking at the smell, my roommate having booked it when he heard the first splatter, flush the toilet four times, hop in the shower, nearly crying in desperation as i try to rinse myself off from the evil i just experienced. as i wimper and hurriedly find new clothes to rush back to the office, i once again drag my foot through dog piss on the floor. \n\ni get back to my truck, throw the bag (which smells of the vile, green shit) into a dumpster and make it back to work just in time for my manager to stop at my desk and ask if i had 'fun clowning around during lunch, and please get back to your damn work'.\n [OUT] ",

(typical girl)  \n\nwhole time she's super stoked, like fan girling about the whole experience, that she was actually \"roughing it\" for a week with me, that i was being \"adventurous\" with her since all her other boyfriends apparently would never do something like this. \n\nwe build a fire, break out the chairs and s'mores, and start drinking. i'm drinking beer, she's drinking wine. after about 2 hours, she's finished a bottle of wine, and i've drank 9-10 beers. we decide to head inside and get to business. \n\nif you've never been in a small rv, the table also folds down so it can become a small bed. the table is held up by a single leg, that locks into place. our table's lock was apparently broken. we start making out, strip down, and decide that before we hop up above the cab into bed, we will do it in the kitchen. \n\nshe bends over the table, i get behind her, and we start. after about 2 minutes, we're going at it. during one of these thrust, i bump into her to hard, she pulls up the edge of the table, the leg collapses, and she falls forward. this is where the fun starts.\n\nupon falling, her arms are behind her, and it's only a short distance before she smacks her face into the camper wall. she catches the wall with enough speed and the right angle to break her nose. we're both in shock, she jumps up, crying. blood is pouring out of her like a fire hydrant, highly upset. we asses the situation, she wants to go to the hospital. we get dressed in a hurry, she ends up putting her shirt on inside out and doesn't put on her bra and panties. \n\nwe start driving, i'm trying to navigate since she has her head in a trash can and i'm attempting not to put this rv in a ditch while following directions on my phone. arrive at the hostpial, and this is where shit hits the fan. \n\nwe walk in looking a hot mess, check her in ect. getting stares from the staff/ other patrons. finally get to see a doctor after a hour of waiting. of course, doctor asks what happened, we awkwardly decline to say how it happens, just that it was a accident. doctor nods, asks a few more questions, and leaves. 15 minutes or so go by, and a nurse comes and gets me for \"some paperwork\"\n\ni'm greeted by two police officers. apparently the nurses/doctors think it's a domestic violence case. get sat down in a another room, and throughly questioned. have to explain how all this happens, my gf and i's relationship, ect. then they ask if we had been drinking, i answer honestly. they look at me, ask how much i had drank, and if i drove her their. panic sets in. i'm thinking they are going to try and arrest me for dui/assault. they leave me in the room and question her. luckily, both stories match up, but they still leave her a domestic violence pamphlet and number, then proceed to yell at me for driving after drinking. after all this is done, both cops tell me it's a hilarious story and think it's funny.\n\nthankfully her break wasn't that bad and it should heal up nicely. unfortantely she has now lost all desire to finish our camping, and now we are both back home. going to be real awkward trying to figure out a way to explain what happened. now i had a rv for a week which now i must clean all the blood out of, and hopefully not get charged a additional cleaning fee. oh and i prepaid the rv and campsite for the week and can't get my money back.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: this is from almost a decade ago, but probably one of the major fuck ups in my adult life. \n\ni was home alone around 10:30am and there's a knock at the door. i open up and it's a neighbor i've talk to a few times and once gave a lift down the street, so he knew i drive a pickup truck. he asked me if i could help him move some furniture a few miles down the road because he was moving into an apartment. i didn't really have anything to do that day, it was a wednesday and i didn't have work until later that night and it seemed like a nice thing to do, so i figured sure why not, i'll be neighborly today.  \n\nso we drive over to his place and load a dinning room table, four chairs and a mattress in the back of my truck. it's a tight fit for all of it, but he assures me that the new place is not far down the road. \n\nso we pull out and head on our way, but first he asks me if i can stop by the bank on the corner because he needs to get some checks to pay for rent, no problem, makes sense, so our first stop is the bank. we go there, it's early in the day and it doesn't take long. he comes out and says he got the checks. \n\nok next we're going to the new apartments right? no, his girlfriend is in the hospital so he wants to stop there and tell her he's taking care of the move. ok so we head to the hospital, it's only about a 2 miles from where we started. \n\nso i sit in the car and wait for him to come out, he takes a bit maybe 30 minutes and he comes out. alright now we're going to the apartment right? \n\nnope, he tells me he needs to get his drivers license from the dmv, ok we head there.  again i wait in the car, he takes like 45 minutes this time. well dmv, what can you do right? but this whole thing is starting to take much longer than i hoped and i do have work at 5pm, so i'm hoping this is the last stop before the apartment.  alright finally he comes out and he's finally ready to go to the apartment complex. \n\nso we head to the apartment front office because he says he needs the keys. i park out front and he goes in. i call my girlfriend and tell her what i've been doing all day, basically telling her i'm hoping we get done soon, she says something like, wow, you're such a nice guy, well good luck. \n\nso the apartment complex is taking way too long. he has been in there almost an hour and it is really close to the time for me to get leaving for work. i head into the office and he walks out the same time and tells me he can't move in today. i don't specifically remember why he told me he couldn't, but at the time it made sense to me. \n\nso now i'm in a bind, i need to go to work, but i've got a truckload of furniture. he tells me if i can rent a small u-haul for him he'll pay me back. i kind of knew this was a bad idea right off the bat, but i really just wanted to be done with all of it so i agreed and we head to the rental place, i rent a u-haul in my name (pretty dumb on my part, but i was young i guess) and we load the furniture into it and i head off to work. \n\nof course when i tell my girlfriend about this later that night she's pissed, and she tells me she's calling off the next day so we can track this guy down and make sure he returns the u-haul in one piece. \n\nso the next day my gf stay home from work and we call the guy to find him, he tells me he's at a furniture store in the parking lot. so we head over there, turns out he was hanging out in parking lot offering to move furniture for people to make money to pay me back. nice, but kind of shady. anyway he just got s guy who needs a couch moved to give him $50 to drive it 15 miles north or so. my gf decides i can't be trusted with this guy anymore, so she tells the new guy i'm going to take the couch and the two of us will go up, while my gf and crazy moving guy go to see about getting into this new apartment. \n\nso this day was basically me moving other people's furniture with my pick up, while my gf went through the same basic thing i had with the neighbor, basically driving from one place to the next to get all the pieces to some chain quest that would end up with him getting an apartment lease which it turns out he did not have, even though he had told me it was already set up. \n\nso after i move some furniture, i call my gf and she tells me this guy's life and possibly his mind are in much worse shape then we had thought. so it turns out the guy had not gotten a new lease before he told me he had to move, he just saw a sign at an apartment building that said something like \"new tenets needed! first month free!\" and just decided he was going to move in. then when he went there, the guy had told him he needed a personal check and his license to move in, so enter me, who drove him all around the place to get these things. well the \"personal checks\" he got were just starter checks from him opening a checking account at the corner bank with the minimum amount of money for a checking account. so the apartment complex would not take them, also, as most people might guess, even though the first month's rent was free, they did in fact need a deposit of $1,000, which my neighbor did not have. \n\nso my gf relates all this to me and tells me they're now heading to the social security office because he says he has a check there and that will cover the deposit. \n\nat the social security office, my gf later told me this, the neighbor is acting kind of manic and panicky a bit, so my gf tries to take care of him by talking to the people running the desk, the people at the desk think my wife is his social worker. so as it turns out this was at a time where they were trying to phase out sending social security checks and instead making a debit card type system. so my neighbor had not opted into this yet and because of that his account was messed up a bit, also it turns out that he had never updated his address to the current place he was living, so the checks were being held at the post office, which is where he had been claiming them, so he convinces my gf that the check is at the post office. \n\nso we head now to the post office, and they of course do not have his check. as the post office employee tells us, since he had not updated his address in a year, the post office had stopped accepting the checks and now his check had been sent back to the main social security office, but until they actually received it, the office would not be able to issue a new one. \n\nmy gf at this point is very annoyed with the whole thing and yells at the neighbor basically what the hell are we going to do with your furniture if you don't have a place to stay and you can't get your life together!? my neighbor breaks down and starts crying in the parking lot and i'm at a loss as to what to do. \n\nmy phone starts ringing at this point and it is a number i don't know, but i take it anyway because what the hell else am i going to do at this point?\n\nsurprise to me, it's the neighbor's girlfriend. she's still in the hospital, turns out she has cervical cancer and they're removing her uterus tomorrow but she wanted to check up on her boyfriend and he had given her my number. \n\nso i explain the situation, i ask her what we should do, and she is also at a loss for words because she thought everything had been taken care of. well she gives us more info and the rabbit hole goes so much deeper. turns out my neighbor has schizophrenia, which after spending two days with him i suspected something was wrong with him, but his gf thought he was on his meds, but now she thinks maybe he ran out. turns out the address that his social security checks were being sent to a year prior was a halfway house that ended up burning down, which is when he moved in with his girlfriend and never updated his mailing address. the gf gives us his dad's phone number, and the name of the program he had been in for his halfway house and tells us basically, i'd like to help more but i'm going in for surgery in the morning and i don't know what to do. \n\nso i convey all this to my gf who has calmed down my neighbor at this point, and my gf who used to work in the mental health field recognizes the name of the program this guy was in, in fact she has an ex coworker that works there now. so we call that woman up, my gf tells her the situation, the friend recognizes the guy's name right away and tells my gf to get rid of him however we can and not look back, he was a problem in the program and he's no compliant with his meds and any kind of therapy, just cut our losses and try and find a place for him to stay.  \n\nwell that's great news... so we turn back to the neighbor, we ask him where he wants to stay the night, we settle on taking him back to the hospital and he can sleep in the room with his gf and we'll take him to his dad's house in the morning. so we drive him to the hospital, it's 7:30pm by now after another insane day, we drive home and collapse with a shared \"wtf!?\" \n\noh but it was not over for the night, an hour after we drop off the neighbor, i get a call from the gf again. she tells me that the neighbor got into a fight with a nurse and they kicked him out of the hospital, and she's not sure where he is now. i hang up and my gf and i are discussing whether or not we should go out looking for him. just then there's a knock at the door, guess who?\n\nyep, it's the neighbor, remember i said the hospital wasn't far from my place so he walked back to our place. my gf is not comfortable with him staying at our place so i tell him i can't have him stay, but if he has a place he can go, right in the morning i'll come get him. he says he'll go to the 24 hour denny's cause he knows a waitress there, because of course he does, he claims to know people everywhere. he just asks for some paper and a pen so he can figure some stuff out. i oblige and he walks to the denny's. \n\n6am he knocks at our door again, he's back from denny's. ok so my gf and i have decided, this is the day we get this guy a place to stay and finally get our lives back. we call up his dad, turns out his dad doesn't want anything to do with him. shit. we ask him who he can call to stay with because we need to turn the rental back in and we can't have him stay with us. \n\nhe racks his brain and comes up with an aunt he can call, aunt being a loose term i think she's a distant relative he met at a family reunion. she already has a full house, but is nice enough to take him in, but she tells us she doesn't have room for the furniture other than the bed, which my neighbor can sleep on. so we drive over there and my gf gives the \"aunt\" as much info as we've gathered about his gf, his dad, his program, and his condition, as well as the steps he's going to need to take to get his social security check. the aunt is very understanding and extremely nice, she has another fully grown nephew and her adult son and two grand daughters also staying with her until they can get back on their feet. this woman is a saint. \n\nwe give them the mattress and we take the dining room set to salvation army. the u-haul goes back to the rental place all in one piece, and ultimately i'm just out the price of the rental (minus the $50 i made moving that couch) and my gf is out two personal days. \n\nbut wait, there's an epilogue. a week after all this we get a call from the aunt (we had exchanged phone numbers) and she tells me that my neighbor had gotten in a fight with her nephew and they came to blows and he walked out somewhere. she told us that if he showed up at our place to just call the police because we gave him as much can help as we could and there wasn't anything left to do. he never did show up at our place though, i have no idea what happened to him in the end.\n [OUT] ",

(remember that motto from earlier? complete bs. go buy their shit on amazon and save some money.) the company started rolling out aggressive schematics that were to be enforced by the district managers and the suits that run visual merchandising. this was fine for me because i loved my department. talking about beer and wine all day was great and i've made connections with tons of people and got them to love specific beverages. my department looked impeccable every damn day. but, over time, i became fatigued of holding myself to such high standards with the addition of management never acknowledging their (mostly student) workforce. my coworkers and i would constantly joke about how we'd do everything and the managers would sit in the office on their phones, looking at snapchats, texting, looking at golfing sites, etc. (i've seen them doing all this even when we were swamped and could use the extra hand).\nnow, at this point, i have been looking around for another job because i need to get out of their before i pull my hair out at all the hypocrisy. i've found a few labs on campus that i could apply to and actually gain experience in my science background. plus, i would have to leave this job as fall quarter would barely leave me any availability for the hours required for my position.\n\nhere is the fuck: i just got suspended. why? being angry and blowing up on one of my managers for the hypocrisy because i finally had enough of that high-pitched screech that she calls a voice of hers, i've been needing a pinot noir that our warehouse had tons of, but they couldn't be bothered to send me a case for god knows what reason despite me only having 3 bottles on hand. so, i created a fake customer request for someone named hugh jass and mike hunt who both wanted this wine. i then create the order under the name of someone we'll call laura (a very universally hated employee with the absolute worst attitude i have ever observed). i did this and time passed on. a few days later corporate shit themselves when they saw hugh jass. mike hunt was ok, but hugh jass wasn't apparently.\n\nso, corporate is launching an investigation (why launch an investigation when we actually needed the wine and it was such a silly act.. not even funny.. just stupid.), to which i believe is an excuse to waste some time at their headquarters. my manager said i could either voluntarily resign or be suspended without pay indefinitely. i chose the latter because i'll have found something in the meantime since the corporate machine is really, painfully slow.\nand that's it! my time there was exposed me to beer and wine distribution and i have created all of the connections that i needed. i'm thankful for that and not much else. time to go find a job that pays less/better and will actually be fulfilling :)\n [OUT] ",

(they all still frequent the same event i met them at.) i, again, ordered a single drink, and in this case sat down for maybe 10 minutes before a bouncer came up to me and told me to go away. and i'm still not sure whether *she's* still upset about events, or if the manager on duty (who white-knighted in a manner harder than anything i've seen before or since) assumed on sight that i was up to no good.\n\nat any rate, given just how salinated the staff was, maybe it's a good thing i didn't have time to get any food?\n [OUT] ",

'nancy' wasn't home but her computer was on and so was her online alarm clock (going off like crazy). so i did the logical thing, i went to turn it off, clicked the \"x\" on the tab. however, her screen was open to facebook, and this is where the fuck up starts...\n\nshe was having a conversation with her ex ('penelope'. 'nancy' had told me she was completely done with 'penelope', no more talking to her or seeing her. well that was obviously a lie cause the conversation was open right there (both parties responding to each other). so i decided to be a snoop (happens when you and your partner live together and something \"wtf\" shows up like that right in front of you). i read through the messages, and the words \"i love you\" were exchanged from both parties as well as planning to meet each other while i was away at work (red flags!).\n\nas should be expected, i got really mad, grabbed the first thing i saw and snapped it in half (a röyksopp \"junior\" vinyl on her turn tables in this case; anyone know what that was worth and how stupid i am?). i didn't do anything else (minus knocked over a glass of water on her keyboard when i turned to snap the record).\n\nso i turn back to the computer and start messaging her friend ('susie'), from her account to figure out why 'nancy' and 'penelope' are still talking and hanging out behind my back. 'susie' tries her best to fill me in, she believes 'nancy', is in love with both of us and is too messed up in the head to decide (though she just decided...).\n\nmy ex obviously sees the conversation (she's still never returned to the house from wherever she claims to be). and knows i'm mad and argument pursues. we are now almost, undeniably broken up (and i think i'd be stupid to go back to her). \n\ni told her at the start of the relationship, i would be okay with 'penelope' being around until things got serious. she agreed to this but has since called me crazy when i started telling her \"lose the ex or lose me\". (this isn't the first argument we've had over 'penelope'). once i found out 'penelope' still had feelings for 'nancy' and was still in love with 'nancy', i told 'nancy' to quit seeing 'penelope'. they could still talk, but not see each other.\n\nthe other day, we were in her room, i was in her lap and we were browsing her japan trip. and she tabs over to facebook, and i see her ex asking \"hey i thought we were supposed to hang out today, are we hanging out today?\" and a back history of them planning to hang out (all after the time when i told her enough is enough). so at this point i told her to end all contact, if she didn't, i was out of her life.\n\ni assumed she had ended it all with 'penelope', but today i found out that was a lie. and since i had told her to end all contact, she's messaged 'penelope' that she's sorry this is happening to 'penelope' and that she loves her and will talk to her later.\n\nand i guess the real fuck up is her's. she left her alarm on and facebook wide open for the world to see, but i definitely fucked up by investigating.\n\n \n\n\nlesson learned, if your new partner is still talking to their ex, don't get involved.\n [OUT] ",

 but then she looks at me with terror in her eyes.  she says, \"i ate the chocolate.\"  \n\nyou wot, m8?  \n\nshe says she ate the chocolate and now feels…kinda weird.  kinda tired.  i said omg maria, you ate the wrong chocolate!  she ate an entire strawberry wafflecone zenbar thc-infused edible!  this was a freebie from a dispensary i got a couple months ago that i left lying around because i didn't want to fuck with it because it didn't say how much thc was in it.  anybody who's tried edibles before knows that you can easily eat way more than you need to and thus, it's better to err on the side of caution and dose small at first.\n\nmaria asks me if she's gonna die.  i think about it for a second and remember that nobody in the history of planet earth has ingested so much thc that they died from it.  however, with my luck, this could easily be the first case in history of that happening.  \n\ni laughed and told her, no maria you're not gonna die, but you might have a bad trip.  i tell her that it was marijuana in the chocolate and asked how long ago she ate it.  she said 30 minutes so i suggested she throw it up so as to save herself from letting it digest further.  she tried, but to no avail.\n\ni said well maria, you can chill here until it wears off, you're certainly in no shape to drive.  she begrudgingly agreed and thus began probably the worst trip she's ever had in her life.  this poor lady sat on my couch trying not to die for the next 7 hours.\n\ni searched the interwebs for any information i could find about how much thc was in this bad boy since there was none on the wrapper.  turns out there's 120mg of thc aka 1.2 grams.  the chocolate bar was sectioned off in 12, meaning she ate 12x a regular dose!!\n\nthen i start searching for anything i can find about what to do when someone's eaten more weed than they should have and the best i can come up with is one post on erowid about how milk and cookies can help sober you up.\n\nmy friend agrees to bring milk and cookies and finds maria on my couch all bundled up in a blanket.  \n\ni tried to sit with her and keep her company, but she wasn't having it.  tried to turn on the tv or put some music on, wasn't having it.  she told me not to look at her and to \"not call any mens (sic)\" which i believe meant that she felt like someone might take advantage of her in her vulnerable state.  clearly the paranoia has set in.  \n\nanyways, my friend shows up with the milk and cookies and she agrees to eat one and drink a little milk. \n\nwe play mario kart in the other room and check on her every now and then between races.  a couple hours pass, the sun has gone down, she's now 4 hours into the ride of her life when we check on her.  \n\n\"i ate all the cookies.\"  \n\nwe laugh our asses off and tell her that that was what they were for and she begins to look a little relieved.  slowly over the next couple hours, she starts to look less terrified and actually a little refreshed.  my friend leaves to go to dinner with her girlfriends and i make plans to go out as well, telling maria that i have to leave at 9:30 but that she's more than welcome to stay until she's cool to drive.  \n\nshe says my place is scary at night by herself so she's going to sleep in the car if that's ok.  i say sure that's fine, go ahead and that i'd be back to check on her when i got home, but that if she went home to please text me that she made it back.\n\n10:30 rolls around and i'm in the club telling the story to my boys when i get the message:\n\n\"i got home thank god!\"\n\nphew!  our collective nightmare is over and order has been restored.  but i don't think she will ever ever ever ever eat anything in my house ever again.  \n\nthe irony was that if she'd only been a little less picky in her chocolate choices, she woulda been fine.  i'd recently come back to canada with a huge dark chocolate bar that was easily 3x the size of the edible but she didn't eat that one which was plainly in sight.  nope, she went for what she thought was the one i'd forgotten about and karma was an instant bitch yesterday.  \n\nnow the only question is: should i call her back to clean next month?\n\n \n\nbonus: maria on the ride of her life\n[http://imgur.com/4ipyyw7](http://imgur.com/4ipyyw7)\n\n**edit:**  thanks for the gold!  made the front page for the first time ever!  \n\nhere are some replies to frequent comments:\n\n- i hadn't seen the al madrigal bit until now but that shit is hella funny.  i can 100% assure you that this really did happen on friday.\n- i did offer to drive her home early in the afternoon and my friend certainly woulda followed in her car but she wasn't having it because her family was at home and she was freaking out.\n- by the time 9:30 rolled around she was definitely down from a [10] to a [3] and looked visibly refreshed.  my parking garage is underground and gated/covered so she was in no danger to chill down there for a bit.  based on when i got the text message and when i left, she chilled for half an hour and bounced.\n- turns out 120mg is only .12 grams, not 1.2 so phew!  thank god my metric math sucks!!  she'd prolly still be trippin' if it were more!\n- for the record i didn't take the photo, my friend did.  she was like \"let's take a picture!!\" and i said no, but she did it when i was in the other room anyways.  when she showed me at the club (her and her friends showed up later and also thought it was hilarious), i fuckin' died and decided to post it.  hey at least i blurred her face.  \n- the candy bar was definitely labeled: [http://imgur.com/tphwf10](http://imgur.com/tphwf10)\n [OUT] ",

\n\nupon meeting with the head nuns and impressing them with the little latin i knew (i attended a catholic school when i was a kid where there was a big focus on latin, and before you ask i'm not and none of my family is catholic) they took me to mother theresa's tomb to pay respect.  while bowing our heads in silence, along with about twenty five other nuns who just happened to be there, my phone receives a call, in full volume.  when i took it out and tried to mute it via the mute switch, which obviously didn't work, i yelled **\"ssshhhhhiiiiiiittttt!\"** in a wave of panic, then realizing i could simply click on the power button to mute the call.  although i didn't say it too loud the room was completely quiet, and unfortunately the noise echoed around the room.\n\nrealizing what i had done i quickly turned my head up and saw every nun looking at me, some of their eyes wide open as if they saw a ghost....deeply embarrassed i vigorously apologized and not knowing what to do i put my head back down pretending nothing happened.  needless to say it was awkward.\n\nafter the moment of silence they continued to give me a tour, followed by lunch and then a meeting to discuss things.  while i was deeply embarrassed they didn't take too much offense to it, and while i was ashamed they laughed it off and by the time we were in the middle of lunch it was back to talking like it never happened.\n\nturns out it was my friend who called, wanting to know what time it would all be over.  later in the evening we met for dinner and we joked about how she picked the worst time to call, which obviously i don't blame her, how could she have known i was literally in front of mother theresa's tomb when she called?).\n\nshortly before leaving calcutta the mtcc called to tell me they liked what i was doing, and long story short through the power of networking i began to work for the refugee centre of the united nations to help refugee camps and what not gain access to the internet, which is a story for another time.\n [OUT] ",

(foreshadowing/dramatic irony)\n\nso ten or so minutes pass, and we are just about done with vaping but are still busy chatting away. suddenly, a high pitched siren sounds. in that split second i had no emotion due to the raging adrenaline and slow realization of how much i just fucked up. i knew exactly what needed to be done. eyes fixed on the exit, i was running on pure adrenaline for the next hour or two and it was a very intense experience. i pick up my wallet off the table and i tell my mate that we need to leave. fast. \n\n\"emergency - evacuate as directed. emergency - evacuate as directed\" these words played on the emergency sound system and became a sort of ringing in my ears for the thirty seconds i was in the building. everything was so surreal. i hoist my bag over my shoulder and open the door leading into our dark, personal vape cave. plumes of vapour pour out and i start for the exit. i briskly walk with my friend, trying to blend in and be as inconspicuous as possible. as i was on the escalator to the street level, my friend and i hear one of the employees say, \"were you smoking in there?!?! come here now!!\"\n\ni continue up the escalator and turn around to see my friend exclaiming we had nothing to do with it (it’s bad he lied - i know. we honestly just didn’t want to get expelled from our respective schools. i must stress that i know how bad our behaviour and sense of morality is). i continue to the street level and briskly walk away. i was slightly concerned because my friend wasn’t behind me but i assumed he was somewhere among the masses. i duck behind a corner about a block away and catch my breath. i feel like the biggest idiot. i set off a smoke alarm - made everyone in a massive cbd building evacuate, and then left the premises to evade any fine - i am a total idiot and horrible person - i cannot stress this to myself and you all enough. please forgive me reddit.\n\nso i'm sitting on a ledge in a secluded area behind a kentucky fried chicken branch trying to lower my heart rate and calm myself down all the while furiously ringing my friend to see where he is. fifteen minutes later he picks up:\n\nme: \"where are you!\"\n\nfriend: \"i'm being detained; they won't let me go\"\n\nme: \"haha don't joke around, i'm behind kfc. come\"\n\nfriend: \"i'm not joking - they are keeping me here and sorting it out. i'll be able to get out of it in about ten though. don't worry. stay in the city\"\n\na welcome wave of relief sweeps over me. for the first time in about 20 minutes, i'm relatively calm. however the fire truck horns and police car sirens where saying something else entirely. \ni didn't hear anything from my friend for 30 odd minutes and was starting to get worried so i give him a ring. \n\nme: \"hey mate what’s going on?\"\n\nfriend: \"this is so shit. i'm so angry with myself. the whole building had to be evacuated; not just the internet café. dude, the cinema  had to be evacuated (the largest cinema in the central business district with over 20 theatres), the game show arcade, the shops – everything - all evacuated – thousands of people involved. the owner of the building came down and is currently shouting at the owners of the internet cafe explaining how he has lost over 10 grand (due to him having to refund all the movie goers’ tickets).\"\n\nat this point - he unexpectedly hangs up (due to what i later found out was a security guard demanding a chat). shortly after, i get a text saying - \"pretend to be my dad\" my heart rate shoots up and i now realize the severity of the situation is on a completely new level. i'm in school uniform at this point so naturally, thoughts of going to a budget clothing shop darts through my mind in case i have to go in there and \"bail out\" my \"son\". fuck. i am such a dickhead. we are such dickheads. (at this point i later find out that my friend quickly scrolled to my name in his contacts and labelled me as dad)\n\ni get a call from the owner of the internet cafe. \"hey is this (insert dad's name her)’s dad?\"\n\nme: \"yes?\" i say with a forcibly confused tone.\n\na foreign voice with an eastern accent replies somewhat authoritatively, \"can you please come in to collect your son in the city? he has just set off a fire alarm in our internet cafe for vaping and has been ordered to pay a $1500 fine\"\n\nnote: at this point i quickly make up a plausible back story in my head and i explain i'm up the north coast attending to business matters. my friend does something similar and claims his mum is in hospital. \n\nme: “oh well i’m actually out of town at the moment…” \n\nmanager: “does your son have any relatives that can come and get him?”\n\nme: “no – the majority of our family is overseas.”\n\na few seconds of silence pass and i hear my friend on the phone. he quietly whispers that he is on loudspeaker\n\nfriend: “dad?”\n\nme: “yes?” i say and with a forcibly angry and disappointed tone enquire, “why would you do something like this?!?! what is going on?”\n\nfake conversation ensues as we try and persuade the owner to let my friend off through heartfelt “father to son” chatter. at this point i’m sweating profusely and now know the true meaning of stress. my friend rings me a couple of times in-between the aforementioned call and the end of the saga to essentially explain that he had two options. either he called his actual parents to pick him up and pay the fine, or the cops would’ve been called. he stupidly texts me asking if he should start for the fire exit and escape (which on top of how much distress, angst and inconvenience we had caused to an innocent couple thousand people seemed like the stupidest thing i had ever heard.) after discussing privately his extremely limited options and sharing our obviously resentful sentiments towards our incomprehensibly daft actions, i get a text saying, “i’m out – where are you”. \n\none and half hours after i did one of the most foolish things in my life, waves and waves of mild euphoria and relief blanket my cognizance and i can’t believe what’s happened. to cut a long story short, after much debate and arguing with the managers of the complex – my friend managed to charge the fine to his mum’s rarely checked credit card and is now hoping that she doesn’t check the statement (like usual). (sorry friend’s mum!)\n\nwe run out of the city and contemplate how much bullshit we caused people who didn’t deserve anything. a selfish vape in a room with a smoke detector caused the evacuation of a couple thousand people from their movies, dinners, gatherings and games. i feel like such an idiot. today, i fucked up. \n\n \n(sorry!!!)\n [OUT] ",

mistakes.\n\nalmost every year i take a trip to mexico to my parents hometown to celebrate this festival called la cruz de mayo. it's basically celebrating the holy cross, but everyone just messes around and gets drunk and stuff. it's actually pretty fun. anyways, late at night when the activities really start to get wild, my friends and i were hanging around the edge of the town where the ghetto \"dangerous\" side of it is located which was separated by a river. so we were hanging around and most of the teenagers and kids were pretty drunk by this time because this one carnival game prizes had beer and my friend kept winning it over and over again, but i was one of the few still sober. so i'm looking at the stars since we're not in the city or anything and it gives a great view. i notice a huge cloud of smoke and bright lights something like a huge fire. i didn't freak out or anything, but i pointed out to everyone and everyone thought it was a huge fire. we decided to make the stupidest decision ever and cross the bridge to the ghetto side of town. literally a minute walking there was no fucking streetlights, no house lights, no shit. only the moon light and the light from our phones. i thought something terrifying like some ghost or monster was going to pop out and try to kill us or something, but i wasn't far off. eventually we're walking and my friend calls out the obvious and says this is a stupid idea and we should go back to the carnival. another friend points out someone could be burning at the moment and we're the only ones who can help. later, there was a family and the mother asked in a very nervous tone what we were doing here. she turns around to her husband who is frantically trying to unlock the door and get it open. holy shit. as if that wasn't enough, moments when they all get inside we suddenly hear a car and we all look at each other in fear. i pathetically hid behind the thinnest tree ever as we all get on the sidewalk as this orange mustang looking car drives past us driving backwards and extremely fast, stopping at the top of the hill (imagine something like san francisco road hills, but a lot smaller). the car turns off suddenly and turns back on following a huge roar from the engine. we all just bolted. the only thing on my mind was to get back to the bridge to the carnival. adrenaline was pumping through my body as we can hear the car coming closer to us. i saw my friend fall and tumble and start rolling down the street eventually getting back on his feet and continue running. even the situation i couldn't help, but start laughing and i almost pissed my pants in laughter as i continued running and left him there. the seriousness of the moment came back quickly and i yell to turn to the alley i see nearby. we all turned to the alley and instantly dive into a big metal trash bin. we close the lid once everyone was in, but we quickly realize that my chubby friend wasn't here. he was fucked and on his own. i close the lid and we all sat in that thing not making a single fucking sound. i thought this was a bad hiding spot and we were screwed due to the loud banging on the bin. i got my phone light and muffled some of the light. some of us were shaking and this kid that was following us around around 8 or 9 years old had a tears coming down his cheek. we heard the car doors opening and closing hearing the men to start looking around for us. i had no clue where the chubby kid was at, but i assumed they got him, but we heard nothing about him from the chatter of the men. my other friend whispered that we should make a break for it. it seemed like everyone was ready to get the fuck out of this disgusting garbage bin. another friend opens the lid slowly and we start to climb out. we didn't see the men nearby wondering why they didn't look here because this is literally the only alley there. as we are about to make a break for it crossing to the other side of the alley. the last kid falls and makes the loudest noise ever by banging against the trash bin. fuck i thought followed by a what was that from one of the men, but as soon as the kid fell no one bothered to help him back up on his feet and we all bolted. we ran so hard and we were so out of breath once we made the bridge i was so relieved to finally make it back. so no car in sight and we started to take a count of how many of us were here and everyone was hear expect for the chubby kid. but holy shit i couldn't believe he was alive as we all saw him limping from the dark street. he was fine but just extremely tired. amazed how we got out of that alive, we strolled back into town laughing about what just happened. the next day there was no news about the smoke and fire, and i wasn't really mad about wasting our time going out there and almost getting killed or kidnapped because it was a nice memory having something exciting happen in my not-so-exciting life and for the rest of us to have that we won't forget. one thing i forgot to mention, as the car drove by us for the first time i saw his face in the shotgun side of the seat for a split instant. the scariest looking thing i ever saw. he didn't even look human.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: so, this did not happen today. it happened thirteen years ago. i was a completely inept seventeen-year-old canadian in grade 12, and i had gone to france for the year. it was through a for-profit exchange year company that asked people to take in foreigners for free (pretty sweet business plan). my parents were gracious enough to foot the bill; they are awesome people that wanted us, their children, to receive the best educations possible. \n\nfor my part, i saw it as a way to do something interesting. i had done french immersion since primary school (thank you, canadian education system), and i wanted to master the language. i also wanted to get out of doing the hard work involved in all of the advanced placement courses that i would have to do if i stayed in my hometown for grade 12.\n\nthere were two obstacles in the way of me having a really good time, however. the first was that i was fat, lazy, and weird (read: socially semi-retarded), having spent most of my teenage years isolated in the basement with my pc playing video games. the second was that i was placed with, quite frankly, bitches (not at all fitting any stereotypes about french people). i was supposed to stay the whole school year with one host family, but it didn't quite work out that way.\n\nthe first family i stayed with was consisted of a mother, father, and two hot french daughters who were around my age. it was in orange, one of the more southern towns in the country, though not quite on the mediterranean. it was september when i arrived, and i was super pumped to see the tropical vegetation and accompanying late summer weather. however, i was still a weirdo. i was a nerd, scared of social interaction (especially with the hot daughters), so i stayed in my room reading a lot.\n\ni was expected to be some manner of house slave, because the exchange company wasn't giving my host family any compensation for my presence in the house. i was used to the easy life i had had with my parents, and did not shape up quickly enough for the mother, who was the enormous bitch in this first equation.\n\ni don't fault her completely, as i was not exactly the best house guest, but she had her issues. she would constantly reference her fibromyalgia, a generalized pain disorder with no discernible physical cause that i later learned was suspected of being psychosomatic and frequently accompanied by hypochondriasis, and would yell at me for what was essentially a lack of social skills.  she even called up my mother and told her she was going to put me on a diet (this was within a week of meeting me). i think she expected some kind of north american adonis she could pair up one of her daughters with (she must not have looked at the picture i sent).\n\nafter a month, she had had enough (and me too). she called up the exchange company and they found me another family in annemasse, a little mountain town on the border with geneva, switzerland. i was thankful to be on my way, and the father drove me down to marseilles to hop on the train up to the mountains.\n\nin annemasse, i was placed with a much older lady. she was in her sixties, and had four or five adult children, and a few grandchildren as well. she was a spry older lady, who was living on what amounted to a small farm. there was a menagerie of animals: cats, a pregnant shih tzu , a bunch of chickens and a rooster. the property was walled, with a gate at the front. the old lady gave me a key to the door so i could come and go as i please, and my bedroom was in the loft (with an adjoining bathroom).within a short time period after receiving the key to the front gate, i lost same. i then started relying on pressing the intercom and having the old lady buzz me in. this becomes important later.\n\nat first, things seemed improved. the lady had a nasty temper, but i didn't get on her bad side, for the most part. i went to school in the town, where i met some fellow expats. the drinking age was 16, and i had met an australian dude i used to knock off of school for drinks with at the various bars around town. the school we were at did not give a fuck about us, and we weren't expected to write any tests or do any work (i was in heaven).\n\ni met the old lady's children, who were kind (kinder than their mother, at least). there were a couple of daughters who i saw frequently: one had a son a few years younger than me (we'll call her l), and the other was extremely busy with a career in business (we'll call her d), but she had adopted a little girl from vietnam a few years prior to my arrival (we'll call the little girl m). m was five-years-old, and spent a lot of the time at the house, as grandma was free daycare while d was at work.\n\nafter christmas came and went, m's birthday rolled around in january. m turned six, and for her birthday gift, her mother, d, bought her a chinchilla.  little m named the chinchilla 'kiko'. because m spent so much time with her grandmother, d bought a cage and brought it to the house.\n\nthis cage was massive. fucking palatial. it was taller than the three-person couch and about half as wide. kiko was no bigger than a hamster at that point, and to be stuck in this cage would not be much of an imprisonment, relatively speaking.\n\nnonetheless, the old lady, in her wisdom, decided that it would be a good idea to let the animal roam wild throughout the house. this was the house with several cats and a dog, i'll add.\n\nfinally, we come to it. it was a weekday evening, sometime in january. it was right before supper and we were engaged in our normal routine: watching an episode of awfully french-dubbed ms. marple mysteries before we started making supper (i had to watch some horrible shite with that old lady). we were sitting on the couch, which was in a large open-concept room. the supper table and kitchen were behind us, and the side of the couch was pressed up against a wall, with a little walkway between the other end and the other wall. m was sitting on the couch next to me, and the old lady was on a recliner near the opposite wall. the old lady had let kiko out of his cage to be chased by the shih tzu, who had given birth a few months prior (the puppies had been adopted) and was no longer hindered by a large belly. the shih tzu, by the way, was in the habit of chasing kiko, and we (the old lady's adult children and i) were convinced that the dog would eat the chinchilla if it ever caught him.\n\nthe memory of the moment is etched into my grey matter: wearing slippers, i stood up to set the table, took a right to walk out through the gap between the couch and the wall, and watched as the dog chased kiko under a small end-table-type piece of furniture on the far side of the room. this was normal, so i proceeded to complete my turn. suddenly, a streak of white and grey fur shot out from the end-table and ran right into the path of my foot. my heel was down, the ball was coming down, and there was nothing that i could do but finish the step.\n\nwhat i had stepped on was soft, and i whispered a silent prayer to the universe that when i lifted my foot, i would find one of m's plush toys underneath.\n\nunfortunately, it was not to be, as kiko's twitching body was all that i found when i lifted my foot. there was no trouble telling that the animal was fucked. he was trying to move, but his limbs were missing their mark each time he tried to find purchase on the floor. immediately spoke up, to let the old lady know that her grand-daughter's animal was hurt, then i felt some pressure on the back of my legs. little hands were pushing me. m had noticed that the fat canadian pig had crushed her little kiko.\n\nit was at this moment that i heard two of the old lady's daughters had entered into the house downstairs: l and d. i started apologizing to both m and the old lady. the old lady asked what had happened, and i explained as best i could, that it was an accident, and i was sorry. m had started wailing for the life of her crushed companion, and her mother, d, was up the stairs in a flash.\n\ni was in shock. i honestly had no idea what to do. m was trying to make kiko walk again by pushing him along the floor. i can't recall exactly, but i think there was a bit of blood exiting his lips as he did so. i apologized profusely to everyone, and watching m's attempts to save her friend was breaking my heart.\n\nthe old bitch turned her vengeful gaze on me: i was a god-damned loser and had made her grand-daughter cry. l, her other daughter, saw this vitriolic speech beginning and tried to explain to her that it could have been any one of them that killed kiko, and that she was taking the chinchilla's life in her hands every time she took it out of that massive cage. the old lady was having none of it.\n\nafter a few agonizing minutes, i was still at a loss for what to do. they tried putting kiko back in his cage, but he expired almost immediately afterwards. returning to the evening's routine, i started putting the chairs around the table for dinner. this was decidedly the wrong move.\n\nthe old lady yelled at me and told her daughters that all i cared about was filling my fat gut with food and that i was a heartless north american piece of shit. i tried to apologize and tell her that i was sorry and didn't know what else to do, then she sent me up to my room. both d and l tried to argue that she was being unreasonable, that i was still just a kid and clueless, but the old bitch was having none of it.\n\nthings were decidedly fucked at this point. the old lady stopped buzzing me into the front gate after this happened, and i had to rely on waiting for one of her children to arrive so that i could get back in. i stopped eating any meals with the old lady, and mostly subsisted on junk food bought from the vending machine at school.\n\nthis wasn't quite the end of my time in france, as eventually things calmed down enough that the old lady was civil with me. things weren't the same, but she was letting me into the house again. in february, there was a two-week school break and i had made plans to go visit my aunt in dresden, germany (she had been seeing this german guy for most of my life). i was so excited to take a break from the oppressive atmosphere. i was beyond ecstatic when i hopped on the train in geneva.\n\nunfortunately, in my reverie i never noticed a little streak of shit i had left on the bowl of the toilet in the bathroom adjoining my room (i'm fully aware of how foul that is). apparently, while i was enjoying my time in der vaterland, the little bit of poop started stinking and the old lady went up to investigate. it couldn't have been much of the brown stuff, but it sent the old lady into a conniption fit, and when i returned to france, expecting a smile or at least a non-plussed reaction, i encountered only rage.\n\nthe old lady contacted the exchange company, who sent a representative to see me. this person let me know that i could live with another host family in a nearby community, but i had had enough. i spoke to my parents and they booked me a flight home. \n\ni returned home in ignominy at the beginning of april... except not really, because my family had let slip the story about the chinchilla and all my friends called me the chinchilla killa (i got xbox live with the original xbox that year and it became my gamertag) and it somehow endeared me to them. i got a job at mcdick's and spent the rest of the summer selling burgers and going and getting shit-faced with my friends. i was 18 that april (19 is the drinking age in my province) and my parents weren't as strict on preventing me from drinking booze because i had gained experience with yon liquor whilst in france, so there's that.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: day 24 of my cross-country motorcycle trip back in august. i left vegas that morning swearing to never go back to that city again. it was going to be around a six hour ride before i would make my way to the north rim of the grand canyon, on a route that saw me going from nevada to arizona to utah and back to arizona where i would post up for some camping on the north rim.\n\nthe weather wasn't bad at all. blue skies and high temperatures, but it was nothing compared to the triple digit riding i was suffering through a few days previously. most of the ride went off without a hitch. but between a slight hangover and 90 degree temperatures, there were a lot of stops for water.\n\nwhile i was riding through the desert of arizona and utah, i was dodging storms for a good portion of the afternoon. most were small in size but whatever was in their path was absolutely drenched. my storm-dodging luck eventually ran out in utah. trapped in construction traffic, the patch of gray i had been eyeing for a few hours now was directly overhead. for a storm that looked so daunting in the distance, the rain was surprisingly light. at first. before i could finish my thoughts of appreciation, the light rain turned to a skin-reddening downpour of water and hail. completely caught off guard, i found shelter at a gas station to watch the hailstorm last for two more minutes and end quicker than it came. as an east-coaster, hail and rain wasn’t something i was expecting to run into out west. \n\n\"well that was fucking annoying.\" i wasn't concerned though because the sun would dry me after a little bit of riding. i pulled out of the gas station and went back to admiring the western landscapes and dodging storms.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/v4gnmq9\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\na little after 4:00 pm and i finally got myself to the north rim entrance. no entry fee that day due to the 100th anniversary of the national park service, normally that'd be exciting but i already paid for a national parks pass. i asked for directions to get to locust point. i knew it was around 20 miles into the forest; i just needed to know the specifics. i could tell that the ranger manning the entrance booth was new when he was flipping the map up and down to figure out which way was which. after he looked it over, pointed out the roads i needed, and made a few marks for me, i thanked him for his help and went to do some sight seeing before i went looking for a campsite. \n\nabout twelve miles past the entrance is the north rim visitors’ center where you can walk to overlooks for the canyon. immense. that is the only way to describe it. lo and behold, i spot another storm rolling in from the distance. i snapped my pictures and got out of there before i got stuck in another one of those. hail in the desert? what kind of shit was that? i was running out of daylight to dry me off and it was much cooler at this elevation than the desert riding earlier in the day so i wanted to avoid more rain. \n\nthe ranger at the entrance to the park had told me the road i was looking for, route 22, was five miles inside the park. so i backtracked from the visitors’ center to look for the road. nothing. there were roads, some without signs, some with signs, but none with signs reading 22. \n\ni did a few sweeps through to make sure i wasn't being a blind fool. nothing. i made my way back to the visitors’ center so i could get some better instructions. \"ohhh, yeah route 22 is about five miles back from here.\" i must be exhausted, i thought, because i didn't see a single sign with anything resembling a 22 while riding around. \n\nso i rode back another five miles and took a road that i was almost sure was wrong, but figured it couldn't possibly be any other road. i was getting increasingly frustrated because my daylight was rapidly diminishing, the temperatures were dropping, and the storm was right on top of me. \n\ni turned around, with the rain starting to sprinkle, and found the first ranger i could. third time is a charm. she informed me that the road i've been wasting all my daylight looking for is several miles outside of the park in the kaibab national forest. i thanked her profusely, sat on my now wet bike, and rode back on the now wet roads. \n\ni was pretty damn frustrated at this point. seeing this, the universe decided it needed to really fuck me up good. that's when the hail started. riding through rain feels like being stabbed with needles, but riding through hail feels like being stabbed with knives. i had to pull over and wait for the hail to stop before i could continue. \n\nthe hail eased up within minutes, the rain went back to a light sprinkle, then stopped completely. the sun wasn't much use for heat and warmth at this point so i rode out of the park soaking wet and freezing. noticing i had less than 80 miles of gas left in the tank, i figured i better fuel up before i head into a forest for the night. getting gas was the one smart decision i made this day.\n\nfinally, finally, finally i started riding the 24 miles of forest road i needed to get to locust point. but it wasn't just one road that i needed to get there. there was a network of roads, all of which lead to different points along the canyon. to my surprise, the road was well maintained and easily manageable on my shadow. i got a few miles in, found the next road i needed and continued on. i might just make it with a little light to spare, i thought. oh how wrong i was. \n\nwith visibility getting worse and worse, i missed the sign for my next turn and continue riding straight until i got to a puddle that covered the entirety of the road. no way around it. i checked my map, and realized i needed to turn a while back. i was annoyed but also relieved i didn't have to cross through the mess in front of me. \n\nall the time i wasted throughout the day had finally caught up to me. it was dark now. with each turn, the road conditions got worse and worse. the rain from earlier left puddles scattered throughout the road but easily avoidable. mud was flung all over but i didn't care. i got into a comfortable rhythm cruising the forest roads and dodging puddles in the dark. \n\ni should have figured i wouldn't have gotten to the end without a few mishaps. riding my cruiser a bit quicker than i should, on gravel forest roads after a rain, in the dark, you can imagine the issues i'm about to have. \n\nsneaking up on me, i rode directly into a puddle covering the width of the road. the rear tire washed out to the left and the bike went down to the right. between my anger and the adrenaline rush of dumping my bike in mud, i was able to lift it up without much issue. so now my bike and myself are covered in mud. and wet. and cold. in the dark. miles deep into the forest. \n\nthere's no going back now. a few more miles, a few missed turns, a few times stopping and using my headlight to read my map, and i get to the last road i need. \n\n\"locust point 8 miles.”\n\ni was so relieved. i crawled my way along, learning my lesson from earlier. another road-wide puddle was coming up but i saw a small chance of an easy crossing, an elevated dry spot on the right side of the puddle. if i hit it just right it would be smooth sailing. well i didn't hit it just right. the rear tire started fishtailing to the left. i got a foot down for some support but in the process i grabbed a hand full of throttle. the tire caught traction somehow, standing me directly upright. except now i wasn't facing forward towards the road. i was 90 degrees to the right and accelerating into the trees. i managed to grab my front brake and stop right in-between two trees. the whole thing happened in less than a second. 500 hundred pounds of metal sinks down pretty quick onto a soft forest floor so it took a bit of rocking to get out and back in business. \n\nfurther down the road i managed to wash myself out in mud one more time while trying to get to the point, this time with some campers nearby who surely heard me swearing at myself.\n\nbut i did it. i made it to the point and found a camping spot. i don't know if it was exhaustion or just my own stupidity, but in my rush to get my campsite set up and get myself changed out of my wet and muddy clothes, i used my shadow’s headlight as my source of light. except my bike wasn't running. i assumed my battery could survive a few minutes of use without the engine running. but we all know what happens when you assume. \n\ni get set up and rush over to my bike to make sure she'll pop off okay for me tomorrow morning. i got a bad feeling when i saw my neutral light dimming out. \n\nclickclickclickclickclick. \"fuuuuuuuuuuuck!\" \n\nand with that i went to bed. i had enough. but the north rim wasn't done with me. a mid-night storm made sure to wake me up to remind me of the shitty situation i was in. then it flooded the underside of my tent to slap me across my damn face. i reached out and dug a quick trench to help alleviate some of the water flowing underneath. i'd like to think i made it difference but it was mostly just so i could feel a little better about going back to sleep. \n\nit wasn't long after sunrise when i woke up. i peeked outside the tent and saw my bike was still standing. the rain didn't do much to wash the mud that was caked onto it. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/xlk07bk\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nthe first thing i did was look for an incline to get myself push started. there was an ever so slight tilt to the road leading down to the end of locust point, but i couldn't get the speed necessary to get it to pop off. i gave it a couple tries, none of which were close. as i was pushing my bike back for another attempt, a car came driving by. a middle-aged man with a brooklyn accent got out, gave me a puzzled look and i explained that my battery died. despite having a bad knee, he got behind the bike and helped give me a running start. a little closer this time, but not enough. we chatted for a bit and asked me if i tried to call anyone. he said he had service, it flipped between zero and one bars, but it was at least something. i had checked my phone the night before and didn't have a thing but i checked again. holy shit. somehow, 24 miles into the kaibab national forest, i had the faintest inkling of cell phone service, something that i found was completely absent in places that were more civilized than where i was now. \n\ni called up the american motorcycle association roadside assistance, which i bought specifically for this trip, and attempted to give my details. it took several dropped calls, a lot of repeating myself, and a lot of choppy voices but i had someone working on finding me a tow truck. i said my goodbyes to the man who stopped to help and thanked him for all he did. the lady assisting me on the phone had told me it might take a while, as there were no towing facilities nearby. i walked back to my tent; leaving my bike a few hundred yards down the road, and started gathering my things. \n\nwhile packing i heard the noise of some sort of vehicle coming down the road. i looked up and saw a couple merrily cruising along in a side-by-side atv. i watched them pass in what felt like slow motion. i wasn't sure if i was looking at a mid 40's husband and wife out doing some forest riding on a saturday or two beautiful angels sent from heaven above to rescue me from the forest that was trying to murder me and consume my soul. \n\ni walked up to the road when i heard them coming back from checking out the point and waved them down. \n\n\"hey, is that your bike down there?\" the wife asked me. i explained my situation and asked if they had a set of cables to give me a jump. they didn't, but they would ask some of the campers they passed a bit up the road. i thanked them and they went on the hunt for cables. \n\nwhen i heard the buggy coming back, part of me just knew this was my chance to finally get out of here. they held them up and the grin on my face nearly blew out my cheek muscles. finally things are starting to look up and i can get on with my trip. we get everything hooked up and my shadow starts up right away. hearing those pipes fire up and start roaring was one of the most beautiful sounds that had ever graced my ears. we said out goodbyes and i watched them travel up the road to return the jumper cables they borrowed while i twisted on the throttle. \"don't let that die, now,\" the man said smiling before he left. \n\n“believe me, i won’t!”\n\ni called the ama back to cancel my roadside assistance request. i felt bad for the woman who had been helping me, she seemed truly concerned and was working hard to get me out of there. i was very much appreciative for that. \n\ni kept on the throttle a bit to build a charge back up. feeling comfortable, i let off and started putting the electrical components back in place. then the motherfucker died. my face dropped in disbelief. i went through the five stages of grief trying everything to get it running again. i hit the acceptance stage before i started thinking clearly.\n\ni knew there were people somewhat close. i knew they had cables. i can still get out of here. so i walked. it took me about twenty minutes to find nearest campers to me. they were posted up right on the rim of the canyon, with their chairs set up side-by-side while they watched the scenery. i interrupted their peace to ask if they were the ones with the cables. not them. so i kept on walking. 15 more minutes and i got to another campsite. i tapped on the camper to see if anyone was in. nothing. i walked a bit more before i turned around. on my way back, i saw someone was leaving the camper that i thought was empty. i asked him if he had cables. he did indeed. he said he'd come on down and jump the bike as soon as his wife got back from a bicycle ride. we chatted for a few minutes and i made my way back to the bike to get the seat off and the battery ready again. \n\nhim and his wife came down in their truck and for the second time that day, my bike would soon be running. it started raining as we were getting everything set. he offered to keep on the throttle for me while i got the bike back together, despite the increasingly stronger rain. i can't appreciate this man enough. \n\nso the shadow is running again. i tell him and his wife how amazing they are and i stay on the throttle and ride around in circles in the rain while the battery gets a charge built up. at this point, i decide it would be in my best interest to stay a second night. i have enough food and water to make it one more night (which was pure luck) and the thought of riding back out of the forest after more rain just wasn't tickling my fancy. in addition to the fact that i had no game plan since it would have been fairly close to dark by the time i could get to any nearby town. so i stayed. i parked the bike by the tent and hoped it would hold a charge through the night. i started it and kept on the throttle a few times just to be sure. \n\nthis was actually the first chance i had to relax and explore the area i went through hell to get to. the rain stopped and the fog was mostly gone now and for the first time i could see the canyon from locust point. it was incredible. no pictures or words will ever do it justice; it's just something that needs to be experienced first hand. i walked the trails around the point and everything that happened to me over the previous day might as well have been a distant memory. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/kxjzsrc\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nwhen i first woke up earlier that morning, i spotted what i thought were skunks running around. not something i was too concerned with, but figured i better make sure my food is secure. as i was exploring the point, i realized that those weren't skunks. they were chunky black squirrels with white tails and pointy ears. apparently kaibab squirrels are only located in a 20 x 40 mile area in the entire planet and here they were frolicking around in one of the most beautiful places i've seen. pretty cool experience. \n\nas sunset was getting close, i found myself the perfect rock to sit on that overlooked the canyon. i spent my last arizona evening watching the sun dip out of view behind the canyon while it changed the sky into all sorts of oranges, pinks, and purples. i was the only person on earth with that view. sitting there put a lot into perspective for me and was an experience i'll never forget. above all, i realized i had one hell of a story to tell.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/sfl7bfz\n\nhttp://imgur.com/xbkauvx\n\nhttp://imgur.com/ganc04o\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\ni slept great that night, knowing all that trouble was worth it. but, the north rim had to get its last few punches in before i left. i woke up the next morning, packed up my belongings, strapped them to the bike, kicked a leg over, turned the key, pushed the starter, and got the dreaded clickclickclickclickclickclick. i was getting out of there and it was going to be now. a couple push start attempts and i damn near got the thing. i was convinced i would have gotten it on the third try, but before i could get it to the top of the incline, my saviors who were camping up the road came to check on me. \n\nthe husband gave me a push start, and we got it on the first try. i rode it down to the end of the point and turned around to gather up my backpack and helmet i left sitting at my campsite. i parked the bike with a huge smile on my face, kicked the kickstand do-\n\n“oh my god the kickstand,” was all i blurted out after it died. in my excitement, i kicked it down while in first gear and killed the bike. i grabbed my backpack, strapped on my helmet, and we went for round two. “alright, now no stopping this time,” the man said laughing. and i didn’t. once that bike shot off, i rode it down, turned around, shouted “thank youuu,” with a thumbs up and got right the hell out of that forest.\n [OUT] ",

the 2 nights before this i smoked a bowl in here and tonight i've been going h.a.m on my vape with my window closed.\n\ni try to think of what i should actually do. he would need a warrant to get himself into \"my\" apartment, and right now i can claim i'm sleeping and that i never heard any police or knocking. so i figured he was eventually going to leave and that as soon as he left i needed to get rid of my vape and all my weed, somehow.\n\nthe vicious banging on the door continues along with the constant remarks that the police want me to wake up and come to/open the door. \n\nthe knocking and requests from the police stop. then just a moment later there is a flash light shining through my living room windows, working its way around my apartment. \n\ni quickly get into my bedroom. i fully close my blinds and put my weed and vape on the floor out of line of sight of the window. i then scurried on top of my bed and pretended to sleep. 10 seconds later the flash light is now shining through my bedroom window. though i don't think he saw anything since my blinds were closed.\n\nthe cop comes back into the apt complex and now i hear him conversing with another neighbor.\n\nthey both start saying my name, telling me to come to the door. i continue to just lie on my bed. then the banging on my door gets fucking intense. repetitively banging incredibly hard for a good 3 minutes straight. i have to get to the door i can't just continue to ignore this.\n\ni creep up to my door and in a tired, questioning voice, i murmur, \"hello?\" \n\nthe other neighbor responds, \"dave, it's mary...you left your keys in the door.\"\n\ngood lordy lord lord lordy. i left my fucking keys in the door?!? ok, well the cop sure didn't come here because some one called 911 and told them i left my keys in my door. and i certainly ain't opening my door to get my keys, letting out a possible whiff of reefer. \n\na quick pause after mary finishes talking and the cop says \"dave, this is the police. we're here investigating another matter, but you left your keys in your door out here.\"\n\n\"oh,\" i responded. \"i must have left them in there when i came home earlier.\n\nmary immediately replied \"you probably have nothing on, go put on some clothes then come get them.\"\n\ni respond to her and say \"yeah one sec\" or something like that.\ni stand behind my door for a moment thinking how i'm going to handle this. \n\nafter a minute or two i start slowly walking away from my door back to my room when the cop starts viciously knocking again.\n\ni ask out \"are you knocking on my door?\"\n\nthe cop replies, \"no, i'm knocking on your (next-door) neighbor's door. i'm here for her.\"\n\ni answer back, \"oh, ok.\" i'm able to grab my keys during a quick moment when the cop stepped outside. i go back in my room and listen as the cop demands that my neighbor open her door and that he will be back with a warrant for her.\n\nthe cop left after a little more banging and pleading.\n\nthe cop was definitely banging on my door and trying to get a hold of me, but he was called here for my next door neighbor and was also knocking on her door as well. i would have dealt with soooo much less of this than if i didn't leave my fucking keys in my door.\n [OUT] ",

(keep in mind i was in a part of munich that i did not really know myself in). i later found out that one of them had to go home real badly or his mother would freak out if he didn't make it in time, so they showed him where the next train station is. my drunken mind then thougt of the fastest way down, because i didn't want to be left behind, drunk, in a city where i don't know how to go home. i went to the edge of the caravan above the bonnet and was pondering if i should jump. in my mind i had the scene play like this:\ni jump from the roof onto the bonnet, land on both of my feet, and then i jump a second time onto the floor.\nwell, i finally had the courage to jump.\ni jumped and it did not go as planned.\ni did land on the bonnet with both of my feet, but my muscles collapsed because i was so drunk and i could not withstand the amount of pressure on my feet. i just collapsed onto the ground with my face and arm first.\ninstant regret hit me as my face and right arm were starting to hurt mad. i kind of got myself up and tried to stand up straight.\nholy shit i was so mad at myself that i jumped i almost wept at the thought of my stupidity.\neventually 2 of my friends came back and we went to the nearest train station and i got home safe.\nnext morning i go to the hospital and they x-ray me and i find out that my arm is broken.\nfml.\n\np.s. it actually turned out well because my maths exam was postponed to about 2 months later and i then had time to study, since i didn't do shit until then, and it was due next week.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: today was a pretty shitty day. \n\nso a bit of background: i study music with laptop as my main instrument (music production and stuff), so i'm pretty dependent on my mac when it comes to my education (i usually use it with a midi-keyboard). as this is the last year, one of our final exams is a concert where we are graded on performance on stage. this will take place next week.\n\nanyway, earlier today i was reading up on a history final i have in two days. i was sitting on a bench next to a window wall, which was terribly uncomfortable since there's about 20 cm from the bench to the wall so my back was bent so much it got almost difficult to breathe. so to better the situation i channel my inner engineer and pick up one of the schools choir benches (basically really thick planks we stand on while singing), and proceed to balance it on the edge of the bench against the wall. this works out splendid and i sit much more comfortably for a while. \n\nsuddenly the choir bench slips past the other bench and slams down on the ground. a few heads turned, i just pick it up and put it back into position casually. i then notice my backpack is lying on the ground pretty close to where the choir bench landed, but don't really think about it. \n\nuntil three hours later. \n\na group of music students (including me) meet up to rehearse for the big instrument final coming up, so i whip out my mac only to notice it has a huge ass bend on the edge. turns out the bench hit the edge of it. fuck. i then open it up to see the screen has turned all white and several rainbow-coloured stripes appear in various directions. fuuuuuck. after a few seconds the internal fan starts screaming at me like a goat in a lawnmower and i immediately shut down the computer. fuuuuck. i then take a minute to appreciate how perfect the timing is:\n\n-i have a final in two days, which includes a presentation i was making on my mac. \n\n-i have not only my own, but also several classmates finals next week where i'm expected to play. \n\ni have spent the entire day trying to fix this machine and so far i did actually manage to salvage my samples and project files so i got that going for me, which is nice. i will probably end up doing my final, on stage, with my old desktop.\n [OUT] ",

seasonal employee at the time. there was this cute girl (let's call her maxine) that also worked there. it took a while but i mustered up the courage to approach and get to know her (suffered with severe social anxiety at the time, still kind of do). anyway, it turned out we had a lot in common, had similar goals in life and just clicked right away. it also turns out she was a huge video game nerd. however, as with most relationships involving the opposite sex, somehow the subject of her having a boyfriend came into the equation without any mention of it. honestly i thought it was better to find out this way than to ask directly to save me the embarrassment. mind you this took place a few months before the fu. \n\nfast forwarding closer to the fu, i've known maxine for several months now still working with the same employer. i've never asked her out to hang outside of work knowing that she wasn't readily available, which was fine. we've talked a lot since then though. moving on, later that week another coworker of mine tells me that maxine recently broke up with her long term boyfriend. i was shocked since she never mentioned anything to me, but apparently she's told almost everyone at the store but me. the reason for this according to my coworker was that she didn't want to get my hopes up. disappointed with knowing this i shrugged it off. i know i've showed interest in her but it wasn't overly ambitious. i was honestly content with where we were at and i've expressed that several times. anyway, moving on, a new security guy began working there, kind of old, probably in his late 30s, not very good looking, etc. i've started to notice that he's been trying to make a move on maxine, and to my surprise she was taking the bait. noticed a few times the two getting lunch and leaving from work together. i wasn't a creep about it, just noticed it as i worked. again, didn't think much of this at the time.\n\nmoving onto the actual fu. as i said before, it was christmas time and i recall one of our conversations involving a ps1 game she absolutely loved growing up. she told me it was called legend of the dragoon. i've heard of it too but didn't play much of it. anyway, she was wondering if it was on the psn store. when i told her it wasn't she seemed really disappointed and that she really wanted to play it again. inside my mind i thought it'd be a great christmas gift for her, since you know, she was a friend and i was in a giving mood. i decided to buy it on ebay and got it the next day. with a gift-wrapped game in hand, i went to my job on my day off to hand it to her. luckily she was working and i approached her. i told her i got her a present and her face lit up. i handed the game over and she unwrapped it, completely awed at the fact. she gave me a hug, etc. and at the time i thought it'd be a good time to ask her out on an actual date, knowing that she was no longer unavailable. and so i did and she said yes and that i'd see her at 8 pm after work. \n\n\n\nit was around 3 pm at the time so i went home and decided to chill and take a nap. i woke up at around 5:30 pm to a text saying that she'd like to reschedule because she had a migraine or something and had to go home early. i replied with, \"sure, same time tomorrow?\" and she replied with \"sounds good. :)\"\n\n\n\ntomorrow comes around and it's 6 pm. i hit the shower and get ready for this hot ass date. i get to my job at 8pm and wait for her at the entrance. she comes out and we decide to go to a local joint that's within walking distance (we work at a shopping center, tons of restaurants). we get our food, sit down, and start talking. we were hitting it off pretty well, however she seemed a bit anxious about something so i asked what was bothering her. she tells me that her ex-boyfriend is going to pick her up in 10 mins. in the back of my mind i'm like \"wtf why\" but i never got around to ask why. she tells me that they've been trying to work things out, etc etc etc. i tell her that it's all good and that i understand. \n\n\n\n10 mins hit and to my surprise her boyfriend comes into the restaurant (lol), approaching me to try to shake my hand. i look at his hand and then at him wondering what the hell was going on. i then look at her and decide to swallow whatever pride i had and shake his hand. he tries to make small conversation with me, the whole time i'm looking at maxine. she looks at me with an embarrassed look on her face then up to her ex, asking him to wait for her in the car. he seemed reluctant to go but she felt strongly about it, so he left. \n\n\n\nthe whole time i'm sitting there chuckling at how awkward the situation was. we decide to leave so i gave her a hug (was very tempted to squeeze her ass, but i didn't have it in me). we parted ways and i headed home, somewhat disappointed yet hysterical at what happened. \n\n\n\nnow this is where it gets interesting. the following day i saw her again and talked about what happened the night before. we laughed a bit and went about our day. soon before the end of her shift she came by to my work area to talk. i had to help a customer so i told her i'd be back and walked off. i came back and lo and behold, i see her holding hands with the old security dude as they walk out the store. \n\n\nit hurt me pretty hard but after months of getting over her i realized how hilarious this entire thing was. i learned that i was giving too much time and effort to someone that didn't deserve it. fun experience over all, 7.1/10\n [OUT] ",

you serious?\"\n\"yeah... isn't that what this is all about?\" \n\ni honestly thought at this point i was dreaming because i was tripping hard and time was moving extremely slow. everything was just so... raw.. and i had completely forgotten who i was and my life and the only thing that mattered in the world was this moment i was in. so i asked her again, \"are you serious?\" and without another thought, i took off my sweatshirt and jumped on top of her on my bed. it took about 5 seconds until she threw me off her and exclaimed, \"no. wait! i can't! if 'they' find out, they'll kill me and i'll be in hell forever.\"\n\ni say, \"what the fuck are you talking about? make some sense.\" \n\nshe gets up and looks at me so affectionately and says, \"please tell me you're never going to leave me. we have to be together forever and ever and if anything ever happens between us, they'll kill both of us.\"\n\n\"who is 'they'?? and no one's going to kill us so just calm down. you're tripping and it's just the drug's effects so relax and enjoy it.\"\n\nand in a heartbeat she starts screaming. loud. so loud it's like the devil was in my room. she takes off her pants and then just rips off her panties and starts pacing in my room. she goes to the window and just breaks the fuck down. she starts screaming and sobbing about her dead mother and how she never had a chance to say goodbye to her and how she feels so betrayed. then she starts going on about her coke addicted sister who she loved so much but was consumed by drugs. \n\ni stand behind her and just pat her back like a jackass to try and console her. and then in a second, she shoots up and start talking completely normally to me with the sweetest voice i have heard in my life:\n\na: how are you doing? you know we are soul mates now, right? we have to live in this house forever. and nothing will ever happen to us.\nme: can you please shut the fuck up? because you don't know what you're talking about and you're freaking me the fuck out so just stop talking and lay on my bed and we'll just let this trip run its course.\n\nnow, let me tell you something about 25i. 25i lasts for 12 hours. the story at this point has been a 2 hour comeup and maybe 3 hours of the 12 hour trip. i was scared shitless. i didn't know how to handle this situation and i honestly feared for my life because this girl was completely berserk and she was capable of anything. i kept my cool and we just laid back on the bed and watched tv. we were cuddling but nothing more. not even kissing, as that would send a straight to hell if 'they' found out.\n\na couple hours go by and there are moments of her completely breaking down and screaming but i manage by  ignoring her. \n\nshe starts getting calls by her sister asking where she is. a keeps disconnecting the call. every time a's sister calls, i scream in the background my address so she could pick a up and i could finish this trip by myself, but a wouldn't have it and would cut the call every time, because \"we are soul mates and we now have to live in this house forever and ever.\" a calls her ex and her best friend to try and explain this crazy conspiracy that she's figured out. a wouldn't understand that it was the drug's effects and would get frustrated when her ex or friend were not able to understand her ramblings. she thought she was god and understood everything there is to know about life and the universe (25i has this effect on a lot of people and it could be extremely positive or extremely negative).\n\naround the 8th hour, i get a message from her sister on facebook asking me my address and i hastily send it to her. a's sister and the sister's boyfriend come to my house while a is running around completely naked. she puts some clothes on and then the four of us sit and talk.\n\na was not ready to leave under any circumstance. she would still have bursts of mania and then would completely reverse into a sweet normal girl asking everyone how they are. at one point, she ran out of my house and sprinted down the street screaming that 'they' had found her and i had to run after her and carry her back into the house. my neighbors had come out but luckily we got her back in before anything happened. \n\n2 hours after a's sister had come, we finally decided to forcefully drag her into a's sister's car and drive her back home. as we went, she was screaming along the way and kept trying to not get into the car but once we got her in, we started driving as soon as we could. i was in the car next to her to console her so she doesn't do anything stupid. once we reach her house, i tell her to get out and she does and quickly i close the door and lock it and duck my head and cover my ears.\n\ni could still hear her screaming and crying for me almost like her life depended on it. her father and brothers came out to drag her back in. a's sister's boyfriend drives me back home and stays with me a while because i am extremely shaken up. \n\ni find out the next day that a did not get any better throughout the whole night and was admitted to the hospital the next morning to be sedated for 3 days. when she woke up, her father and brothers pressed her to reveal the name of the person who gave the 25i to her but she said to let it go and forget about it.\n\ni call her a month ago and after having a long apologetic talk with her and i find out that now she is completely sober with everything. she was a big pothead for years and now she doesn't smoke weed or drink and she doesn't touch any type of hard drugs.\n\nfor me... well... i self diagnosed myself as having slight ptsd. i still continue to trip with various substances and various people but at any moment someone does something that resembles that trip, i get flashbacks and become extremely paranoid. i've become use to it, but it's still freaks me out every now and then. i don't keep in contact with a even though she had hinted the last time we talked that she would like to. \n\ni thought about this trip quite a few times and i felt a little selfish. i wanted her to come to my home and trip with me because i really just wanted to fuck her but i wanted her to enjoy it as well. i felt responsible for months and it was a heavy burden to carry the months i didn't know how she was doing. \n\ni hope you enjoyed the read. stay safe.\n [OUT] ",

can i help you or call somebody to take you home?\", assuming that since it's a college town this dude is just hammered and lost. he stands up, turns his head to look at me, mumbles and then proceeds to whip out his dick. now, i had to be sure so i peer over his shoulder (i'm ~6'2, he's ~5'8 but he's stocky and looks to have about 100 lbs on me) to confirm. this guy immediately freaks out and makes some grunts that imply that he's not happy i'm checking out his junk. my reaction, then, is to say \"hey bub. this is my room, my domain. if i want to see your dick, i **get** to see your dick.\" his reply was to start pissing all over my shoes.\n\nat this point, i couldn't stem the tide, so i push him towards the bathroom while his trident is still gushing. i hear him lock the door, but i couldn't care less as long as he's not causing any more damage. but of course, this fucknugget* lives to destroy. i hear him simultaneously turn on the sink faucet and shower as water begins to flow out from under the door. i can only assume he's having a private pool party in there as the door is still locked and he has yet to speak a single word to me. i'm getting pretty peeved with the guy so i tell him i'm going to call the police if he doesn't give me something to work with (other than his peen). i don't want to have to deal with police or get this guy in trouble, but i gotta do what i gotta do to get him the hell out.\n\nas soon as i say the word police, this dwarf of a man comes barreling out of my bathroom nekked as the day he was born, dripping water and what i assume to be shampoo. i jump the fuck out of the way as i'm not trying to start a lubed-up wrestling match in my living room. he tries to open the front door to escape, but in doing so locks it as it was previously unlocked. frustrated, he plops himself down - still sopping wet. by now, i have the police department on the line and i've told them the pertinent details. they tell me to stay on the line and away from him while i wait for them to arrive.\n\nblinding blue and red lights cut through the night as not one, not two, but six squad cars block off the parking lot and street. fucknugget hears the sirens and suddenly remembers that the door hadn't been locked originally. with all the swiftness a hobbit can muster, dildo swaggins unlocks the door, swings it wide open, and hops the porch guardrail in one swift olympian motion. as the fuzz swarms the block in order to cut off this guy's escape, one yells at me to ask if i'm okay. i point at the rapidly fleeing mass and mutter, \"he's over there....\" as some poor civil servant tackles the nakedman through several shrubs and back into the gravel parking lot.\n\nthe next day at work, i tell this insane story to my coworkers during a break and it turns out one of the girls knew who he was and told me that dildo swaggins had taken a bunch of psychadelics with his bros. my shift ends around noon and i head home to take a nap for the energies as i'm tired from work + last night's adventures. waiting for me at my door is mr. swaggins himself. he introduces himself, apologizes for his disturbance of my residence, and asks me if i've seen his lost phone in my closet or bathroom.\n\ni attempted to drop the charges just because of how ridiculous the whole thing was, plus my landlord paid for all of the damages which amounted to a torn shower curtain, a broken bathroom door handle, and a puddle of pee in my closet. however, the courts weren't having it and i ended up having to show up in court to testify and continue to receive letters from the local victim assistance program.\n\nlock your doors at night, people.\n\n \n\n*i've used several pronouns as well as nouns to describe the home invader. hopefully, it wasn't too confusing for you.\n [OUT] ",
