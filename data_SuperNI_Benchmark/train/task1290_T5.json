Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] As his Arsenal side dissolved and were brutally dispatched by Bayern Munich - once they awoke from 45 minutes of complacency - Wenger will have felt every goal, every added humiliation, like a blow to the solar plexus. Five second-half goals. Five more questions to ponder.\nA proud man, Wenger will have surveyed the thousands of empty seats that increased in number at Emirates Stadium with every Bayern strike on the way to a humiliating 10-2 aggregate loss and surely questioned what more he can do at Arsenal.\nThe Gunners were out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the seventh successive season. However, few nights could have been more chastening than this one for the man who has known such glory, but who now may be contemplating the end of the road.\nOnce the German champions were prodded into life by a generous penalty award and a red card after Laurent Koscielny fouled Robert Lewandowski, they delivered a ruthless verdict on just how far Arsenal have been marginalised from the elite European group they once occupied with style and with regularity. It underscored a dramatic fall from grace.\nWenger was not subjected to widespread rebellion or mutiny inside the stadium, but there were ominous signs that can often be used as indicators that a manager's future has reached its defining moment.\nA group of Arsenal fans, not huge in number but noisy, led a protest march on Emirates Stadium from their old Highbury home, brandishing banners that read \"Enough Is Enough\", \"No New Contract\", \"All Good Things Come To An End\" - and what looked like a rather hastily assembled affair that read: \"Stubborn. Stale. Clueless.\"\nThey chanted \"Arsene Wenger - You're Killing Our Club\" - harsh and heartbreaking words aimed at a man who, whatever even his fiercest critic will say, loves Arsenal and has done so much to enrich them.\nIt was strictly a minority. But an even more significant indicator may have been the large number of empty seats inside the Emirates. It was announced that 59,911 tickets had been sold - but it was fair to say 59,911 had not pitched up, many clearly deciding they had better things to do despite having shelled out hard-earned cash.\nArsenal equipped themselves well for 45 minutes, but the whole night and performance had the stench of too little, too late - and there is no good news, no consolation, no hard luck story about successive 5-1 defeats in the Champions League.\nThe manner in which Arsenal collapsed once Bayern equalised was an alarming barometer of fragile confidence, belief and morale. It was understandable heads would go down as hope was snuffed out, but the manner in which they were picked apart was horrendous. Players were stretched hopelessly out of position and Bayern almost scored at will.\nAlexis Sanchez was even robbed by Arjen Robben, hardly a tackling heavyweight, on the edge of his own area for one goal in an incident that summed up the Chile forward's night after the controversy of his exclusion at Liverpool.\nSanchez was a central figure amid stories of training ground unrest but he was restored here as Arsenal went in search of a miracle.\nHe was greeted warmly by Arsenal's fans when his name was announced, but he was not able to make a point to Wenger or anyone else on this night and his wave as he was substituted late on could even have been construed as the start of a long farewell between now and the end of the season.\nAfter taking his seat on the bench, Sanchez was pictured chuckling briefly, something that riled some supporters on social media, despite it being impossible to determine precisely what he had found humorous.\nThe backdrop to this dead rubber - there was never any realistic chance of this Arsenal side in their current condition reviving it even when they took the lead on the night - was a cloud of uncertainty over the club that is becoming increasingly toxic.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThere are no guarantees about the future of arguably the three highest-profile figures at Arsenal, a state of affairs creating a mood of chaos around Emirates Stadium.\nWenger is giving no clues as to whether he will sign a two-year deal that is on the table, amid mounting criticism of his methods. Sanchez looks certain to depart in the summer as his relationship with the club fractures. And Mesut Ozil's stock has fallen as his own contract situation is shrouded in mystery.\nThis would be a situation to prey on the nerves and frustrations of Arsenal's fans even before it is set alongside a team that look further away than ever from a Premier League title challenge and now suffering from one of their most humiliating, harrowing Champions League experiences.\nThe double figures aggregate loss actually might have been worse and this latest last-16 exit is made even more painful by being cloaked in the feeling of an end of an era after a Champions League story that has increasingly become one of diminishing returns for Wenger and Arsenal.\nThey were made to look light years away from Europe's elite by Bayern. Wenger may have cursed the luck of the draw once more - and even the officials - but there was no escaping a seventh straight exit at the last-16 stage.\nAs Arsenal fans gathered on Holloway Road and around Emirates Stadium before kick-off the pervading emotion was gloom. There was no sense this Arsenal could frighten Bayern in the same way they frightened AC Milan here almost five years ago to the day, when they had the Italian giants rocking at 3-0 down after losing the first leg 4-0.\nAnd so it proved. Not this time. Wenger's Arsenal, in this Champions League context at least, now find even a gallant near-miss beyond them.\nIf there is the growing sense that this is Wenger's final fling, there was also an ominous feeling of an extra layer of fear to add to the frustration of Arsenal's supporters. Is this finally the time they end up without Champions League football for the first time this century?\nWenger's sense of pride would be damaged enough by an elimination as wounding as this, an exit that left no room for debate about Arsenal's reduced status. It might hurt even more if he had to start life outside the European footballing environment that has become his and Arsenal's natural home.\nThe Gunners have always managed to find a place in the Premier League's top four but this now faces its most serious threat, with Chelsea the champions-elect and Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool (and arguably even Manchester United) all looking in better shape.\nWenger, who wrote about \"our pride and our honour\" being at stake in his match notes, might have to swallow his own pride should Arsenal end up with only a Europa League place at the end of this season. There was no pride or honour to take away from this night.\nWould Wenger, at 67, have the desire to effectively start again and rebuild in Europe's second-tier tournament, or would that be a timely cue for him to step aside for a successor?\nThere is still time for Wenger to salvage a measure of success and respectability from Arsenal's season and either stay or go on a high of sorts.\nArsenal will be overwhelming favourites to reach the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley with a last-eight tie against non-league Lincoln City awaiting them this weekend, while there is still the top-four place on offer.\nThe FA Cup has been the only silverware sustaining Wenger and Arsenal in the barren years since the title triumph of \"The Invincibles\" in 2003-04.\nIf - and it is still a big \"if\" - he wins it, it will allow Wenger, Arsenal and their supporters a celebration. But even that may not prove to be enough to soothe the atmosphere of unease in this part of north London.\nChastening nights like these, when the cavernous gap between Arsenal and those they wish to challenge was cruelly exposed, may carry more weight when it comes to Wenger's verdict on his own future and that of the supporters on him.\nWenger was spared at the final whistle, with only a few jeers to be heard because so many had left. It looked and felt like a lonely existence for Arsenal's manager.\nHe simply shook his head, a mixture of disappointment at the result and what he later said he felt was an injustice at the hands of officials - which carried a note of desperation and straw-clutching when examined through the prism of both legs.\n\"Every Good Story Has An Ending\" read one large banner being paraded outside the stadium before kick-off.\nAnd as Wenger headed down the tunnel and Arsenal's fans headed out into the night, it was hard to escape the growing belief that this one is moving towards its final chapter.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Former Fifa and Interpol adviser Chris Eaton says only \"naive or careless players\" will be caught.\nThe BBC obtained the figures from the Gambling Commission's Sports Betting Intelligence Unit (SBIU).\nIt comes as former Sutton goalkeeper Wayne Shaw is investigated.\nShaw, who resigned from the club on Tuesday, was seen to eat a pie on the bench during Monday's FA Cup defeat by Arsenal, after a bookmaker offered odds of 8-1 that he would do so on camera.\nThe Gambling Commission and Football Association are now investigating if there was a breach of betting regulations.\nFollowing a Freedom of Information request, the SBIU said it received 53 alerts between 1 August 2014 and 23 December 2016, alleging footballers placed bets on matches.\nThat figure relates to uncorroborated reports, rather than confirmed instances of rule breaches.\nBut the Commission also told the BBC that it was looking into more alleged breaches it had identified through its own intelligence work.\nThe rule came into force on 1 August 2014 as an anti-corruption measure. It applies to anyone involved in football at that level - not just players.\nJust a handful of players and officials have been sanctioned to date, but the figures obtained by BBC Sport reveal many more could face punishment.\nEaton said the SBIU alerts primarily concern players that use their own name and account.\nThey did not include:\n\"It is the best the Commission can do within its regulatory embrace,\" Eaton told the BBC. \"But it is the tip of an iceberg that stretches well beyond the horizons of the Commission.\n\"In the absence of a global regulatory model, only naive or careless players will be caught in a tiny national net that is swamped in the massive global web that is sport betting.\"\nThe SBIU was established in 2012 under the umbrella of the Gambling Commission. The Commission, which regulates commercial gambling in Great Britain, said the 53 alleged offences relate to betting on any football matches, and are not necessarily specific to a player betting on their own team or a match they were involved in.\nHowever, it refused to divulge any more information on these cases, arguing that to do so could impede its investigations.\nBetween October and December 2016, 38% of reports on betting activity in sport received by the Commission were football related - the largest percentage - with tennis second on 37%.\nThe unit worked on the case concerning Burnley midfielder Joey Barton, who received a one-match suspension for breaking Scottish Football Association rules on gambling.\nThe 34-year-old has also been charged with misconduct, with the Football Association alleging that the midfielder placed 1,260 bets in the past 10 years. He has admitted the charge and is awaiting a personal hearing.\nIt says it also supported the case involving Frome Town manager Nick Bunyard, who was given a three-year ban and fined Â£3,000 on 9 November, after placing 45 bets against his own teams.\nAside from the cases involving Barton, other high-profile players have also been found guilty, including:\nScottish League Two club Cowdenbeath have suspended defender Dean Brett after he admitted gambling on football matches, including betting against his own team. The 24-year-old is being investigated by the Scottish Football Association over the alleged 2,787 bets he placed.\nNon-league players have also fallen foul of the rules. In March 2016, East Thurrock forward Lewis Smith was given a Â£23,000 fine and 17-month ban. In July, Ashton United striker Martin Pilkington was suspended for four years for a betting breach.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFormer Frome Town boss Bunyard told BBC Points West last November that the temptation to gamble on football was too great for some footballers.\nHe said: \"Because betting culture in football is so rife, you get dragged along because everyone is doing it. You think: 'No-one else is getting caught, so why would I?'\"\nThe previous rules outlined that participants were prohibited from betting on a match or competition in which they were involved that season, or could influence.\nUnder new guidelines, gambling on any worldwide football activity was prohibited, including betting on manager appointments and player transfers.\nDarren Bailey, the FA's director of football governance and regulation, said: \"This betting rule change to encompass all aspects of world football provides a simple, clear and straightforward message to all participants concerned, on where the line is drawn.\"\nFormer FA general secretary Alex Horne said at the time: \"We are really proud of the integrity of the game in this country and it is really important people trust... what is happening on the pitch.\n\"We want to keep our message as simple as possible - and it cannot be more simple that, as a player, you cannot bet at all on football.\"\n [OUT] ",

They are trying to find out if he had accomplices.\nMonday's attack on a Berlin Christmas market left 12 people dead and 49 injured.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was \"relieved\" that the attacker had been neutralised but added that terrorism was \"a recurring threat to us\".\nHer government's main priority was to protect German citizens, she told journalists, adding that this case had raised \"many questions\".\n\"Further changes to our laws and regulations will have to be made,\" Mrs Merkel said at a news conference.\nBut leading Eurosceptics - including French National Front leader Marine Le Pen - have criticised open European borders, a result of the Schengen pact, for allowing a fugitive to move between countries.\nMeanwhile, the self-styled Islamic State (IS) group has released a video showing Amri pledging allegiance to its leader, Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nHe does not make any reference to the Berlin attack, which IS claimed soon afterwards. It is not clear when or where the video was filmed.\nShortly before releasing the video, IS acknowledged Amri's death in Milan.\nWhen Italian police stopped the suspect, who was on foot, at 03:00 (02:00 GMT), he \"immediately drew out a gun\" and shot at the two policemen, Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said.\nOfficer Cristian Movio was injured in the shoulder but his injuries are not life-threatening.\nHis junior colleague, Luca Scata, who had been in the police for just nine months, was the one who fired the shot which killed Amri.\nGerman officials found Amri's fingerprints inside the truck that was used in Monday evening's attack.\nFederal prosecutor Peter Frank said the focus of the criminal investigation into the killings now was to establish whether Amri had had a network of supporters who helped him to plan and carry out the attack or to flee.\nInvestigators are also trying to establish whether the gun used in the shooting in Milan is the same weapon used to kill the Polish driver of the truck, who was found dead with stab and gun wounds in the cab.\nThe attack took place at a busy Christmas market at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the west of the German capital.\nAccording to the Italian news agency Ansa, Anis Amri travelled by train from France to Turin, and then took another train to Milan.\nFrom the central station he travelled on to Sesto San Giovanni, a working-class area.\nAmri, a Tunisian national aged 24, had served a prison sentence in Italy after being convicted of vandalism, threats and theft in 2011.\nHe was known to Italian authorities for his violent behaviour while imprisoned.\nAfter his release he was asked to leave the country.

It creates all kinds of emergency situations where it can monitor and severely restrict citizens and groups.\"\nChina has repeatedly said that it faces legitimate terror threats and that the laws are needed to combat them.

A true Muslim was punished for doing which [sic] the collective will of the nation failed to carry out.\"\nMaulana Habib Ur Rehman is the most senior imam at Glasgow Central Mosque, a role which involves leading prayers and giving religious guidance and teachings.\nThe BBC has confirmed with members of the group that the messages come from the imam.\nQadri was employed as a bodyguard for the governor of Punjab province in Pakistan, Salman Taseer, before turning on him in 2011 and shooting him 28 times.\nAfter the shooting Qadri reportedly told journalists that he was \"proud\" and that he had killed a \"blasphemer\".\nHow Punjab governor's killer became a hero\nPakistan has some of the strictest blasphemy laws in the world, which can carry a potential death sentence for those judged to have insulted the majority religion of Islam.\nHuman rights campaigners and liberal politicians, including Taseer, have criticised the laws as draconian and believe that they are abused to target minority groups.\nThe laws do, however, have mainstream support in the country and an estimated crowd of more than 30,000 people attended Qadri's funeral earlier this month.\nImam Maulana Habib Ur Rehman told the BBC: \"The assassination of Salman Taseer is widely condemned.\n\"Whether I agree or disagree with the views he expressed, as an Imam and as a human being I express abhorrence at the manner in which he was executed.\n\"The execution was not in accordance with Islamic teachings and principles.\"\nLawyer Aamer Anwar has called for reform at Glasgow Central Mosque.\nHe told the BBC: \"To describe a convicted terrorist as a true Muslim is grotesque.\n\"Let's be clear: Mumtaz Qadri was a terrorist. He was no national hero and he was no martyr.\n\"These views expressed are grotesque and whether done privately or publicly they should be condemned unequivocally.\n\"There's real concern within the community that if this is an imam expressing such views, then what is he expressing to our children.\"\nIn further messages, the Imam refers to Qadri as \"brother\" and says that, by killing his employer whom he was paid to protect, he was \"carrying out the collective responsibility of the ummat,\" or Muslims as a whole.\nHis execution, he says, \"is a collective failure of Pakistani Muslims\".\nImam Maulana Habib Ur Rehman is challenged by others in the group who question why he is speaking about a convicted murderer in such glowing terms.\nOne member argues that Qadri took the law into his own hands and that he should not be made a hero for doing so.\nThe Imam also likens Qadri's actions to those fighting Nazi occupation during World War Two.\n\"Just when France was occupied by Nazies [sic], French did all they had to in order to protect their nation,\" he writes.\n\"They were national heroes. Hanging Mumtaz Qadri has raised serious questions about Pakistan's independence.\"\nAnd he links his execution to the issue of Pakistani nationhood.\n\"The issue is not of an individual. The issue is of national identity and Islamic spirit.\"\n\"The fact that the nation chose to settle the issue of Reymond Davis [sic] by forcing his relatives to accept the blood money, and sending Mumtaz bhai [brother] to gallows is a source of grief and immense pain.\"\nRaymond Davis was a contractor with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Pakistan.\nIn 2011, he was arrested and imprisoned in the city of Lahore after he was accused of shooting dead two men, triggering a diplomatic incident between the two countries.\nHe was released after the families of the two men were paid compensation of $2.3m, which many in the country considered to be \"blood money\".\nThe WhatsApp messages are the latest controversy at Glasgow Central Mosque, which is the largest place of worship of any religion in Scotland.\nThe mosque was plunged into turmoil last month when seven members of its executive committee resigned amid claims of intimidation by more conservative figures at the mosque.\nThe allegations were denied by those accused.\nThe Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) is also investigating claims of financial irregularities at the charity which runs the mosque and what it has described as an \"unusual\" management structure.\nGlasgow Central Mosque is governed by two sets of trustees - the executive committee who operate the charity and the property trustees who manage the mosque building.\nOSCR's interim report into the mosque in January found the trustees, who are made up of more conservative figures at the mosque, had acted beyond their powers.\nThere is said to be a long-running contest at the mosque between more traditionalist figures and those, including the seven who resigned, who would like it to be more inclusive of women and non-Pakistani Muslims.\nIn January, The Herald reported that Glasgow Central Mosque had donated money to the orthodox group Tablighi Jamaat, which some argue promotes an extreme brand of Islam.\nThe group says that it rejects violence.\nMr Anwar said: \"There needs to be diversity, there needs to be equality and they need to open it up.\n\"We're not living in Pakistan, we're living in Scotland, and we need to see the values and ideas of the people of Scotland [at the mosque].\"\nIn a statement, the imam said: \"Mumtaz Qadri's execution is condemned as it is not in accordance with due process nor is it in accordance with Islamic teachings and principles.\n\"The selective messages disclosed to you by an unauthorised third party have been misconstrued and taken out of context.\n\"Capital punishment on this particular occasion was inappropriate and any expressions of sympathy or compassion are extended in my capacity as a private individual and not in any professional or public capacity.\"\nGlasgow Central Mosque did not respond to requests for comment.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Just our Solar System, the little corner of the Milky Way in which we live, is vast.\nVenetia Burney, the 11-year-old girl who in 1930 suggested the name \"Pluto\" for the newly discovered \"planet\", remembered playing games in Oxford's University Parks that would try to convey this scale.\nShe and her school chums would hang a two-foot-wide orb on the gates to represent the Sun, and then space out a caraway seed for Mercury and peas to signify Venus and the Earth.\nNeptune was a lump of clay and sited a mile and a quarter from the gates.\n\"And then we were told the nearest star would be in China, and that really stuck with me,\" she recalled in a BBC interview.\nBefore she died in 2009, Venetia got to see the launch of Nasa's New Horizons probe to Pluto. It's even got an instrument on it that is named after her.\nNew Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever despatched from Earth.\nAnd on Tuesday, after nine-and-a-half years of travel at immense speed, it will finally reach the diminutive world, some 4.7 billion km away.\nA few things have changed in the intervening years.\nThe first surely everyone now knows: Pluto is no longer regarded as a main planet and has been re-categorised as a \"dwarf planet\".\nThe second feeds into the first, and that is the recognition of just how numerous planetary bodies of all sizes are, not just within our Solar System, but around all the stars we see \"beyond China\".\nWho'd have thought that some of these stars would have super-Earths and colossal Jupiters?\nThe arguments still rage over whether Pluto should be included in the planetary mnemonics that children learn in school.\nBut in many ways this is a distraction - and a distraction from something that is actually more interesting and really quite exciting.\nThink about it for a moment: If the \"classical nine\" planets were all there were, then Tuesday would represent an ending. It would be the completion of a quest to map out our Solar System.\nAs it is, we now like to think of the reconnaissance of Pluto as just the start of something, as the beginning of the exploration of the \"third zone\".\nIf the first and second zones encompass the rocky inner planets like Earth and the outer gas giants like Saturn, then this third sector covers all the smaller bodies like Pluto that orbit billions of km from the Sun. And they are legion.\nThis third zone, known as the Kuiper Belt, probably contains hundreds of thousands of objects 100km and more across. Pluto, at about 2,300km wide, just happens to be the current \"King of Kuiper Belt\".\n\"Pluto is the biggest and brightest, and, as far as we know, it's the most interesting of this third class of planets,\" Alan Stern, the principal investigator on New Horizons, told BBC Newsnight.\n\"It was a wonderful discovery that our Solar System has this extra class and that - surprise, surprise - it is the most populous class. It's amazing: we had a completely upside-down view until the 1990s.\"\nAnd not just in our Solar System. It is very probable that the dwarf planets are the most abundant type of planet in the Milky Way as a whole.\nAnd remember, they will not all be dull balls of ice and rock.\nAs we're seeing on the approach to Pluto, many will have active processes shaping their surfaces. Some, just like Pluto, will even have atmospheres with evolving climates.\nNew Horizons should be thought of then as a sentinel.\nIt's the first mission designed to go and investigate this third domain.\nAfter passing Pluto, it will be directed to a second Kuiper Belt object, which it will reach in another four years or so.\nMore missions will no doubt follow. Our problem currently is knowing where to direct them.\nPresent telescopes struggle to see the third zone, to pick out the candidates most worthy of a spacecraft encounter.\nBut this is all about to change.  We're now building a new generation of monster observatories whose primary mirrors will be 30-40m across.  These new telescopes will have the sensitivity and the resolution to open up the Kuiper Belt to a new era of study.\nIf you run the models, based on our best understanding, you would have expected a thousand or so Plutos to have been around in the early days of the Solar System, more than four billion years ago.  But then we think there was a big re-organisation, and many of these objects would either have been destroyed in collisions, or scattered by close encounters with their own kind and the bigger planets.\nSome will still be there, albeit perhaps further away than the Kuiper Belt, in an even more distant realm called the Oort Cloud.\n\"If these models are correct, we should expect to find dramatically more small planets, and possibly some large planets that were also scattered out there - Earth-sized and Mars-sized,\" says Prof Stern.\nJust a final aside on Pluto's demotion from \"full\" planet status.\nI got the chance the other day to talk about New Horizons with the famous radio astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell. It was she who facilitated the technical meeting a few months after the probe's launch in 2006 that downgraded Pluto.\nShe could not be more excited about the next few days.\n\"I think New Horizons has come out of it very well,\" she told BBC Newsnight.\n\"By going to visit Pluto and one or two other objects in the Kuiper Belt, it is going to a zone that hasn't previously been explored. And I think it's brilliant.\n\"Being able to send spacecraft out that far is going to lead to a lot of new information and, hopefully, new understanding.\"\nYou can watch a preview of the New Horizons flyby on Monday on BBC Two's Newsnight programme at 22:30 BST. The BBC will also be screening a special Sky At Night programme called Pluto Revealed on Monday 20 July, which will recap all the big moments from the New Horizons flyby.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n [OUT] ",

It also propels men to commit sex crimes. The court's reaction was to criticise the government's inability to act against internet sites that promoted child pornography.\nThe government's reaction was to ban porn sites.\nAcross India, people fumed, raged and ranted. Radio and television talk shows filled up with irate callers speaking both for and against the ban. One radio station was inundated with calls for its debate, To porn or not to porn.\nSocial media was abuzz as many described it as an invasion of privacy and an attempt at moral policing. A bestselling author, Chetan Bhagat, pleaded with the government to not ban porn in a tweet.\nThe hashtag #NextBanIdea began trending on Twitter as many decided to take to humour and come out with a list of things the government could consider banning - from the Facebook game Candy Crush, to people who take selfies and relatives who badger young Indians to get married.\nThe governing BJP, which runs the federal government, was also left red-faced after some pointed out that a few years ago some of its politicians were caught on camera watching pornographic clips on their mobile phones inside a state legislative assembly.\nFor many the ban is futile. Indians are believed to be among the largest consumers of internet pornography - number four in a list of countries published by Pornhub, the world's largest pornographic video-sharing website, after the United States, Britain and Canada.\nIn fact, there are suggestions the move may have had the opposite effect. One Indian website, Quint, notes that Google Trends recorded a sharp increase in keyword searches for pornographic content and porn stars over the past week.\nAnd then there is India's rich history of celebrating sexuality. Some pointed out the irony of the ban in a country that gave the world the Kama Sutra, the ancient text on sexual etiquette and practice.\nOthers wanted to know if the government planned to cover or block access to the country's centuries-old temples and cave art with sexually explicit sculptures and paintings.\nSource: Pornhub/Quartz India\nThe debate has also sparked concern over what some see as a growing culture of intolerance promoted by a series of actions by the right-wing BJP government, many of whose members are self-professed Hindu nationalists.\nSome Indian states, governed by the BJP, have banned the production and consumption of beef - because the cow is considered sacred for India's Hindu majority. The government also banned the broadcast of a BBC documentary on rape, arguing that it defamed India.\nThe film Fifty Shades of Grey was also banned at around the time that the government-run censor board came up with a large list of words that could no longer be spoken on screen - these included lesbian and Bombay (the old name for India's financial capital Mumbai).\nBut it's not just limited to the BJP. Under India's previous Congress-led government, a controversial book on Hinduism by American academic Wendy Doniger was banned.\nFor many, these moves threaten India's democracy and tradition of cultural pluralism. There's a fear that the space for criticism and outspoken views is slowly being constricted.\nFor now at least, the move to ban porn has backfired - the government has been forced to come out and say that it supports freedom of communication. And Indians can go back to surfing for sex.\n [OUT] ",

I have lived this life. This is what I am accustomed to.\"\nHer lawyers estimated her ex-husband is worth Â£8bn.\nBut Mr Juffali, who has been married three times, said in a written statement that was a \"fantasy\" figure, putting his current net worth at Â£113.8m.\nHe could not attend court because he is terminally ill with cancer and undergoing treatment.\nHe said in the statement that he had left the vast majority of his wealth to his three eldest children, including his teenage daughter with Ms Estrada.\nThe sheikh divorced Ms Estrada in Saudi Arabia in 2014 under Islamic law, without her knowledge. He had married a 25-year-old Lebanese model in 2012 while still married to Ms Estrada.\nMr Juffali's solicitors Mishcon de Reya issued a statement after the hearing, stating that he had \"shown himself to be a fair man who has been prepared to offer his ex-wife a more than comfortable lifestyle for the rest of her life, which he believes she deserves\".\n\"The sole purpose of this case was to evaluate an appropriate financial settlement based on Ms Estrada's needs, as opposed to the extraordinary demands presented by her at the start of this case,\" they added.\nMrs Justice Roberts said in her ruling that Ms Estrada had described her lifestyle during the course of the marriage as \"magical\".\nShe added: \"That may well be an apt description. The issue is the extent to which she should be entitled to continue with the bubble of a 'magical existence' for the foreseeable future. I am concerned with ensuring that adequate provision is made to meet her reasonable needs.\"\nMr Juffali has been ordered to pay Ms Estrada her lump sum by 29 July.\nThough Ms Estrada's lawyers said she received the largest \"needs award\" ever made by an English court, larger total payouts have been made in the past.\nIn 2014, a court said Jamie Cooper-Hohn should receive Â£337m in her divorce from London financier Sir Chris Hohn.\nThree years earlier, the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky's former wife Galina Besharova reportedly agreed to accept between Â£165m and Â£220m as part of a settlement.\n [OUT] ",

We've hit the big four-oh!\nThe median age of the UK population (that is the age at which half the population is younger and half the population is older) at mid-2014 was at its highest ever at 40.0.\nHere's the graph to prove it:\nThe end of World War Two brought the first baby-boom. Then the 1960s added a new crowd - now in their fifties. Nearly one-in-five of us are now over 65 - a 47% increase on 1974.\nIt's not happened equally for men and women. People stopping smoking and better treatment for heart attacks and strokes has led to a faster improvement in mortality rate for men.\nThe number aged 75 and over has increased by 149% since the mid 70s whilst for women it has only gone up 61%.\nMen's work has also become less physical and safer, in general, over the period. It's a blessing and a challenge, as the NHS and pensions try to keep up with a longer life expectancy.\nThe ONS has a little present to celebrate this milestone - it calls them a population pyramid - a natty visual illustration of the age structure of a local area.\nCompare these two - Oxford and Poole in Dorset.\nIt's not just the ticking demographic timebomb that these graphs could help us defuse.\nThe row over tax credits has been driven by statistics, after the Institute For Fiscal Studies unpacked George Osborne's warm words in the budget, and turned them into cold dread of the letters they predicted would drop on people's doormats just before Christmas.\nJust like the big four-oh birthday that many of us like to ignore - you're better off embracing the reality of the inevitable statistical truth than getting caught out when it's too late.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The interview in Rolling Stone magazine was not the first time that Penn has seen his work published but his piece, which emerged two days after Guzman's capture in Mexico, was greeted with plenty of scorn.\nThe fact Penn granted El Chapo copy approval, the colourful prose, and the actor's unexpected references to his genitalia and flatulence left many readers baffled - while others accused the media of sour grapes.\nBut what do the experts think?\nA journalist may have to accept with a source whether material could be used, whether stuff is said on the record or off, and you may read back quotes - but giving full-blown pre-approval for a story is definitely not best practice.\nHe is up-front, saying \"this is how it was conducted\" but the fact they put a disclaimer on it doesn't serve to provide any credibility to the story.\nPenn talks about how he contacted Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner and was working at the highest level. But this is the second time in the past 18 months where Rolling Stone has chucked one of the basic rules of journalism out of the window.\nAs for Penn's writing, you take it for what it is. Is it journalism? There are caveats to it, so readers beware.\nIn the writing of the piece, they would have had to have been as sensitive as they could possibly have been in order not to offend those people who have suffered - people have died because of this man [El Chapo]. You want to show due scepticism when he tries to come up with lame excuses.\nIt was a mixture of purple prose and psychobabble, really. I would advise Penn to come and be a student. I would say he has a lot to teach me about acting, but I could teach him a lot about journalism.\nI would say he needed a really good sub-editor who could sit with him rather than do it all afterwards. Rolling Stone writers do tend to write to great length - perhaps I should also ask that the Rolling Stone editorial staff come in for training too?\nHow can we trust somebody who is not trained and doesn't have the same principles as a trained, legitimate journalist to handle a difficult assignment? He has a point of view, one I have no problem with, but you can't go with a point of view to an interview like this.\nI don't mind an actor talking to these people, but when you have him representing a credible, major news organisation like Rolling Stone in an interview with such a sensitive subject, you should have second thoughts.\nRolling Stone had to decide what was more important - getting the story at any cost, or getting it done by someone who knows how to do it. I am not sure this was the right decision.\nAlso, if they had not caught the guy, the law in the US could have caught up with them. There are two precedents here in the US for that - we don't have complete immunity when it comes to the courts enquiring about the whereabouts of a criminal. It's good news for them this guy was caught.\nSome of the critics were accused of professional jealousy but plenty of writers have come out in defence of the piece too.\nJack Shafer, writing for Politico, acknowledged Penn's \"loopy, self-parodying literary style\" but said pre-approval should never be ruled out \"especially if the subject were a notorious fugitive on the run\".\nWriting for the website of the Poynter media studies institute, Kelly McBride forgives Penn, saying \"it's common for a writer's ambitions to outpace his talents\". His editors at Rolling Stone get a hard time, though - she identifies six key points missing from the piece.\nRolling Stone's Jann Wenner said in an interview by the New York Times that the pre-approval was not \"a meaningful thing in the first place\" as Mr Guzman had no interest in editing the piece - and does not speak English. \"In this case, it was a small thing to do in exchange for what we got,\" Mr Wenner said.\nOne of the article's editors, Jason Fine, was asked about Penn's writing style by the same newspaper. \"It's a piece by Sean Penn,\" he said. \"Sean Penn has a particular style and point of view, and I'm happy with it.\"\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] In bringing the past to life, these historical re-enactors need the right kit for the job, but just where do you buy a nice new corset or a cannon?\nFortunately, whether you are after axes or dried apricots, there are 1,000 years' worth of products for sale if you know where to look.\nA thriving industry of fairs showcase a kaleidoscope of items you may have thought lost in the mists of time. Among their stalls you will find steampunk USB sticks and pirate cami-knickers. But why is there such a demand for this stuff - and who makes it?\nThe International Living History Fair is an Aladdin's cave of often strange-looking merchandise spanning 10 centuries.\nIt is one of three major fairs in Leicestershire and Warwickshire which, along with dozens of smaller events, supply re-enactors (and interested members of the public) ahead of the summer display season.\nOn offer at the leisure centre-sized hall at Bruntingthorpe aerodrome in Leicestershire are items which it scarcely seems credible are still made, cheerfully for sale alongside cups of tea and sausage rolls.\nSome are beautiful, some bizarre and many - especially the vast array of axes, maces, knives and muskets on offer - slightly terrifying.\nSeveral stalls drip with terrifying sharp and heavy ironwork designed to make short work of even the best-armoured foe.\nArguably the most extraordinary is the longbow, a weapon of devastating potential.\n\"So why is it not illegal?\" asks archer Tom Mareschall, his eyes glittering with passion for his girder-like bow.\n\"Skill,\" he explains. \"Not many people can draw a longbow and no-one else\" - he taps his chest - \"can draw at 180lbs.\"\nThe variety of goods is dazzling. As well as skull-smashing weaponry, there are clogs, earthenware pots, jewellery themed to Henry VIII's wives, 2ft-wide (60cm) wooden bowls, quills, medieval floor tiles, dried foodstuffs (for that expedition to the New World) and enough leatherwork to account for a small herd of cows.\nDave Allan, the event's organiser, says: \"It's got two main purposes. One is for people to come along and buy things, and the traders to sell them.\n\"The other is educational: for people, from children up, to learn about history, to see it and touch it and really get enthusiastic.\n\"It's funny but loads of people here hated history at school but they have discovered a new side to it through making it come alive.\"\nEnthusiasm is not in short supply but few can have the dedication of longbow disciple Mr Mareschall.\n\"I started aged seven. My left shoulder never formed properly because of the strain. I have six herniated discs in my back,\" he says.\n\"But when people say 'No one could draw a bow that powerful', I can prove it's possible\".\nAnd he is also handy should you want to know what damage an Agincourt-style longbow - which needs that crushing 180lbs (82kg) of \"pull\" - can do.\n\"A good archer could get off 15 shots a minute,\" he explains.\n\"That's a rate of fire not matched until the outbreak of the First World War.\n\"At 100yds the arrows have the force of a .44 Magnum bullet. At 50yds they will go through modern soldiers' body armour.\"\nOn the question of legality, mercifully the axes and swords are blunt and the the bows are impractical to use for crime. But the watchword is common sense - the police would take a dim view of any being carried into a busy nightclub, for instance.\nMuskets capable of firing a projectile require a shotgun licence as well as special permits for storing the black powder they use.\nAs well as the core business of supplying re-enactors, many craftspeople have worked with TV and film productions. Wolf Hall is mentioned several times, as is the upcoming Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\nDella Rebours, who can knock you up clothing and uniforms from the past three centuries, has a particular claim to fame.\n\"I met Roland Rat, \" she says with a smile. \"Because I had to make a new Kevin the Gerbil. The old one got pinched.\n\"A friend of mine who works in TV rang up in in such a state and asked me to get sewing!\"\nAlthough there is a sad lack of 80s children's TV characters on offer, there are plenty of other curiosities.\nAlong with armour stands and the mysterious Battle Spoon (exact purpose unknown), wood specialists Club Axe Ltd offer folding medieval furniture and historical \"glamping\".\nOwner Richard Cooper says: \"Behind the scenes we have cars, not a horse and cart. So if re-enactors want to get their bed from show to show, it really helps if you can get it down to an manageable size.\n\"And we decided to move into the glamping as we had all the bits for medieval tents, so why not offer it to everyone as something a bit different.\"\nAnd if that's not immersive enough, Italian group Sestiere Castellare offers castle-based medieval holidays (proudly boasting \"medieval board games, brothel and torture instruments\") in the Dolomite mountains.\nWhile that sounds pricey, there is something for every budget, from Â£2.50 for an authentically-preserved packet of ginger to roughly Â£15,000 for a suit of armour.\nGraham Ashford, an armourer from Greenleaf Workshop, is pushing the megabudget concept. He is involved in a project recreating the gilded armour of medieval poster boy (and son of 14th Century warmonger king Edward III) The Black Prince.\n\"At the moment we have no firm idea of how much it will cost, but we recently tracked down some hand woven silk and were quoted Â£3,000 a metre,\" he says.\n\"Clearly some people will wonder what on earth we are doing but it keeps these skills - very practical, very traditional skills - alive\".\nWonder or bewilderment is a natural reaction at the fair.\nStefan Pokorny, from Czech company Kasto Armouries, stands behind rows of helmets and breastplates, swords and axes.\n\"Why do people want this? I don't know. They like history. How many axes should someone have? I don't know. But they keep coming; they are happy to see and have them.\"\nMade from a single piece of wood, traditionally yew, the longbow became famous on the battlefields of Europe in the 14th and 15th Centuries.\nIt was most effective when used en masse to deliver volleys of thousands of arrows at ranges of up to 300m (330yds), overwhelming contemporary crossbows.\nIt was key to English victories at CrÃ©cy (1346), Poitiers (1356), and Agincourt (1415) where the hail of missiles tore into massed French knights.\nThe key to success was the training of archers from boyhood to handle the immense strain the bows put on the human body.\nGradually superseded by changing tactics and the arrival of gunpowder, hundreds of longbows were nonetheless discovered ready for action on Henry VIII's ill-fated ship Mary Rose, which sank in 1545.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Media playback is not supported on this device\nIt is not the first time this has happened to the world champion, who finished sixth after an error-strewn drive.\nDuring a very up-and-down season in 2011, he was always bumping into Felipe Massa's Ferrari.\nBut then the wheels occasionally come off the wagon for all great drivers.\nAyrton Senna tripped over a backmarker when on his way to victory in Italy in 1988 and deliberately took out Alain Prost at Suzuka in 1990.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMichael Schumacher had his red-mist moments, too, when his judgement deserted him and he resorted to underhand tactics.\nFernando Alonso has occasionally let his emotions get the better of him as well, particularly when he was with McLaren in 2007.\nF1 is an incredibly intense environment that pushes people to their limits in every possible way. Sometimes, you get these kinds of incidents.\nIt's the flipside of brilliance and Hamilton quite often dances a line between genius and disaster.\nWe saw that in the previous race at Silverstone, when he ran wide trying to pass Massa early on and lost ground.\nUsually, because he is so good, it works out for him. But it will go wrong from time to time, as it did on Sunday.\nIf you itemise Hamilton's race in Hungary, the good outweighs the bad in many ways.\nHis display in practice and qualifying was flawless. And he can't be blamed for the start-system problems Mercedes are suffering at the moment.\nHaving dropped to fourth place by the second corner, he was on the back foot and made a mistake at the chicane and ran wide, dropping to 10th place.\nBut he fought back brilliantly to be fourth before half-distance, in a way that many other drivers would not have done.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThat put him in with a chance of victory when the safety car came out and bunched up the field after Nico Hulkenberg's Force India crashed.\nBut then Hamilton made another mistake, misjudging how late he could brake on coolish 'medium' tyres while trying to defend against an overtaking move by Daniel Ricciardo.\nThe Australian had much more grip on his 'soft' tyres and Hamilton ended up sliding into the side of him.\nHaving changed his front wing and served a drive-through penalty for causing a collision, Hamilton then got his head down, again overtook several cars and fought back up to sixth place at the end.\nYou cannot get it right all the time. Yes, Hamilton made some mistakes, but Mercedes made some mistakes on strategy.\nWe expect drivers to be infallible and invincible, but no-one is that.\nHamilton is a heart-on-the-sleeve type of guy who lives an emotional rollercoaster, but he will bounce back.\nThere was great racing and some wild action at the Hungaroring.\nIt felt more like the first grand prix of the season, when everyone is a bit rusty, rather than the 10th.\nPerhaps it had something to do with the loss of Jules Bianchi.\nThis is the first time this generation of drivers has had to deal with something like this and they had to contend with reminders of Bianchi's death all week.\nFrom the funeral, through a meeting of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association on Friday, all their media interviews and then the minute's silence on the grid.\nMaybe it destabilised them. After all, performance for elite sportsmen is as much about mind management as it is physical attributes.\nFor all Hamilton's problems, he ended up gaining points on team-mate Nico Rosberg.\nIt was a missed opportunity for the German and further evidence that he seems unable to capitalise unless he is at the very front.\nWhat cost Rosberg was his collision with Ricciardo late in the race, an incident that left his Mercedes with a punctured left rear tyre.\nHindsight is a wonderful thing but maybe Rosberg didn't need to let his car drift over as much as he did as he tried to secure the corner.\nHe was trying to defend his position but in doing so increased the risk of a collision. Unfortunately for him, the consequences were serious.\nSebastian Vettel drove a brilliant race to win, but there was no miracle leap forward from Ferrari in Hungary.\nIt was clear that Hamilton had the beating of them on raw pace, while Rosberg was out of sorts all weekend.\nFerrari were simply gifted an opportunity by the poor starts of both Mercedes cars.\nVettel was super-aggressive off the line and never looked like losing the race after claiming the first corner.\nKimi Raikkonen did a solid back-up job a few seconds behind, until he suffered a hybrid system failure.\nThe Finn might well have made it a Ferrari one-two.\nFrom Raikkonen's point of view at least, what happened might be a blessing in disguise.\nHis future at Ferrari is in doubt and it is probably better for him to get the sympathy card from his team rather than finish 10 seconds or so behind Vettel.\nYou might not think so, but a lot of decisions are made on emotion in F1 rather than by studying the data, so Sunday's events could end up benefitting Raikkonen.\nRed Bull and McLaren also had a weekend to savour, with both enjoying their best races of the season.\nIt was great to see Alonso battling with the Toro Rossos and really showing his competitive spirit, which was also on display in qualifying when he pushed his car back to the pits after breaking down.\nIt would have been very easy for him to walk away and let the marshals get on with it - as other drivers have done.\nBut there he was, a double world champion with 32 victories and an all-time great, trying to push his car back to the pits, all in the hope of being 12th or 13th on the grid rather than 15th.\nWhat fantastic commitment that is.\nCommitment was also at the heart of Ricciardo's aggressive, fighting race for Red Bull.\nI was happy to see Daniil Kvyat get his first podium, because he has been getting stronger and stronger this season and his pace was there for everyone to see in the race.\nBut he was not able to cut his way through the field in the same way Ricciardo did.\nIn that sense, Ricciardo is very like Hamilton or Alonso. You know he is going to make things happen for himself. It was great to watch.\nDavid Coulthard was speaking to BBC chief F1 writer Andrew Benson.\n [OUT] ",

They have put a privileged few over hard working people.\"\nThe opposition say their own plans to raise the top level of tax from 45p to 50p are part of a fairer approach to ensuring a budget surplus by 2020.\nUKIP said Mr Cameron had done little to help \"Middle Britain\" while in power.\n\"UKIP will keep pressing for income tax cuts and the scrapping of inheritance tax too in order to give the British people a fairer deal,\" MEP Patrick O'Flynn, the party's economics spokesman said.\nThe Taxpayers Alliance campaign group said Mr Cameron's tax commitments were welcome but were \"not as generous as they first seem\".\n\"He is not planning to raise the 40p threshold quickly enough to keep pace with inflation and he has said nothing about what he would do with national insurance which is a second income tax in all but name,\" said its director Jonathan Isaby.\n [OUT] ",

Its implementation coincided with another conflict four decades ago.\nThe new policy came into force in 1978 under former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's government, just as people were growing increasingly alarmed at the plight of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians fleeing communist regimes by sea in leaking, unsafe boats.\nThe programme, overseen by the federal government, allows groups of private citizens - often with ties to faith-based organisations, cultural groups or humanitarian organisations - to directly sponsor refugees.\nThis means providing the newcomers with basic material needs like food, clothing, and housing, as well as help adjusting to Canadian society.\nFrom January 1979 to December 1980, Canada resettled 60,049 so-called \"boat people.\" More than 50%, were privately sponsored, often by complete strangers.\n\"It really touched a nerve,\" said Brian Dyck, national migration and resettlement co-ordinator with the Mennonite Central Committee, among the first groups to work with the federal government to assist in private sponsorship in Canada.\n\"They felt compelled to get involved.\"\nThat generosity won \"the people of Canada\" the 1986 UN's Nansen refugee award, which recognises outstanding service to the causes of refugees - the only time the medal has been awarded to a whole country.\nSyrian refugees settle into new lives in Canada\nIn a small, crowded classroom in tiny Belleville, Ontario, Syria native Abdel Malek al-Jasem is learning some very important terms in English.\nCoat, gloves, toque, scarf and boots. He scribbles them in a notebook next to their Arabic translations.\nHe will need all of that gear as he adjusts to life in Canada.\nSince 1979, Canada has resettled over 275,000 refugees under the private sponsorship programme, though the number of private sponsorships dipped in recent years to around 3,000 to 5,000 annually from that initial peak.\nBut following the publication of Alan Kurdi's image on front pages nationwide, settlement groups that assisted private sponsorships were quickly overwhelmed by the demand.\n\"You kept getting calls on a daily basis,\" said Lora Remacka, program coordinator with Toronto's Lifeline Syria.\nSince last November, Canada has welcomed over 30,000 Syrian refugees. Almost 11,300 were brought in through private sponsorship.\nBy the end of this year, the federal government expects to have resettled some 44,000 refugees in total, not just from Syria, including almost 18,000 privately sponsored refugees.\nBetween 2013 to mid-2015, Canada settled roughly 2,500 Syrian refugees, of which about 1,600 were privately sponsored.\nIn 2012, Australia launched a pilot sponsorship project based on the programme. In 2015, the United Kingdom announced it was considering creating a similar model.\nDyck told the BBC in a phone interview from New York, where he was attending refugee and migration summit at the United Nations General Assembly, that the programme \"changes people individually, it shapes societies\".\n\"It makes it very personal for them, and that has shaped Canadians' attitudes to international incidents in general,\" he said.\nStill, the programme is not without hurdles.\nRemacka, whose organisation has processed over 800 refugees since last year, 150 of which have arrived in Canada, said there has been a wane in interest. Lifeline Syria currently has about 550 current cases they have been unable to match with sponsors.\n\"In the beginning we had too many (sponsors),\" she said. \"Now we don't have enough.\"\nA report on the use of Toronto food banks released this week noted a surge in the first three months of 2016, linked in part to an influx of newcomers, including Syrian refugees.\nOver 60% of the Syrian refugees interviewed by the food banks were privately sponsored.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is in New York for the United Nations general assembly, announced Canada will boost its humanitarian spending by 10% over the 2016-17 fiscal year. He also announced $467m (ÃÂ£272) in longer term funding to address the crises in Syria, Iraq, and the surrounding region.\nOn the same day, the Canadian government, in partnership with the UN refugee agency and the Open Society Foundation, announced a new programme aimed at promoting the use of the private sponsorship option worldwide.\nThis effort includes the creation of a training programme on how to implement and adapt the Canadian sponsorship model.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Two spills in 2008 affected about 35 sq miles (90 sq km) in southern Nigeria, according to a group suing Shell.\nThe area included sensitive mangroves.\nShell \"dismisses the suggestion that it has knowingly continued to use a pipeline that is not safe to operate,\" it told the BBC.\nThe emails, letters and internal reports submitted to a court in London show that senior Shell employees were concerned before the spill that Shell's pipelines in the area had reached the end of their lives and needed replacing to avoid danger to lives, the environment and the economy.\nThe spills took place in Bodo, a town in the Ogoniland region, where people interviewed for an Amnesty International report into the effects of the incident reported headaches and eyesight problems.\nFollowing the spills, the price of fish, a local staple food, rose as much as tenfold, according to Amnesty. People who worked in fishing had to find jobs in other industries which proved more difficult to find.\nOil spills in the Ogoniland region have also contaminated local drinking water sources, seeping into groundwater, according to a report from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Toxins found by UNEP in the wider Ogoniland area's drinking water include benzene, which is thought to cause cancer.\nThe two spills came from the same pipe on the Trans Niger Pipeline, operated by Shell, which takes oil from its fields to the export terminal at Bonny on the coast. It carries about 180,000 barrels of oil per day. The firm disputes the size of the spills and says much of the oil was spilt as a result of thefts and sabotage.\nIn September 2006 - two years before the spills - a letter from Basil Omiyi, managing director of Shell's Nigeria business, SPDC, to the governor of Rivers State said that the pipeline was of \"immediate and utmost concern\".\nShell had not inspected the pipeline for several years due to difficulties in accessing it, he said.\n\"There is a risk and likelihood of rupture on this pipeline at any time, which if it happens, could have serious consequences for the safety of life, the environment and the nation's economy.\"\nâ¢ Shell stopped drilling oil in Ogoniland, which includes Bodo, in 1993 after growing unrest in the area.\nâ¢ In 2009 Shell paid $15.5m in an out-of-court settlement in a case accusing it of complicity in human rights abuses in Nigeria. It was brought by relatives of nine anti-oil campaigners, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria's then military rulers. Shell denied any wrongdoing and said the payment was part of a \"process of reconciliation\"\nâ¢ In 2013, Shell produced 265,000 barrels of oil per day from Nigeria, which is 8.3% of the 3.2m barrels of oil per day it had for sale from its drilling business.\nâ¢ The area is also one of the most cost-effective for Shell. The cost of producing a barrel of oil in Africa last year was $14.43. Only Asia and Oceania were cheaper. In Europe and the USA, the cost was $17.66 and $21.57\nâ¢ Shell told its investors in its 2013 annual report of the \"disputes\" in Nigeria, where it \"believes that the outcomes of these matters will ultimately be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell\" albeit with the caveat \"no assurance can be provided\"\nA study conducted in 2000 by Shell's Nigeria business and Shell Global Solutions International, the oil giant's consulting business, found \"the remaining life of most of the SPDC oil trunklines is more or less non-existent or short, while some sections contain major risk and hazard.\"\nAn internal Shell email in December 2009, after the spills, said the firm was \"corporately exposed as the pipelines in Ogoniland have not been maintained properly or integrity assessed for over 15 years.\"\n\"The decision by Shell to continue pumping oil through pipelines which they knew were not fit for purpose is quite shocking,\" said Martyn Day, a senior partner at Leigh Day, the lawyers representing the community filing the claim.\n\"The result was an environmental catastrophe for the Bodo Community and the biggest loss of mangrove habitat in the history of oil spills.  The 40,000 residents of the Bodo Community primarily relied on fishing and their way of life and source of livelihoods has been destroyed for years to come,\" said Mr Day.\nShell, in documents submitted in its defence, admits its pipeline failed due to a faulty weld, but disputes the volume of spilled oil. It says much of the damage caused to the area comes from other spills, including damage from sabotage and attempts at theft.\nShell will pay \"just and reasonable\" compensation to those affected, it says.\nShell told the BBC: \"SPDC ceased operations in Ogoniland in 1993 following a rise in violence, threats to staff and attacks on facilities. Levels of violence and criminality have remained high over the following 21 years, constraining SPDC's ability to access the area.\n\"The condition of the pipeline is regularly assessed.\n\"Also, SPDC has always made use of the opportunity presented during sabotage [and] crude theft point leak repairs to carry out on-the-spot coating and internal checks to confirm the integrity of the pipeline and coating.\"\nThe claimants, who are suing for a clean-up plus damages, say the illegal refining only started in earnest after the spills, which killed the fish they rely on for food and their livelihoods.\nThe area's humidity corrodes pipelines and its many rivers and lowlands means fixing a leak often necessitates wading through swamps, carrying floating booms and other equipment, which is slow work, according to one former Shell employee with whom the BBC spoke.\nInternational industry rules call for operators to consider tools to detect corrosion in pipelines, leak detection equipment and so-called cathodic protection in environments where corrosion is a risk. This is where a structure, such as a pipeline, is protected from corrosion by an electric current.\nThere are no leak detection systems or flow rate meters on the pipeline, say the members of the community - systems which are industry standard in the West.\nShell was unable to use its other leak detection systems such as flow monitoring or acoustic sensors because they were sabotaged or stolen and it was \"not reasonable to keep replacing such equipment,\" it said.\nThe claimants say the pipelines were not checked regularly for corrosion or failing welding by robots known in the industry as intelligent pipeline inspection gadgets, or PIGs. In the UK, pipelines would be inspected in this way every five years or so, according to industry experts.\nShell says it employed contractors to guard and monitor the pipeline and arranged for inspections from the air. The claimants say a lack of boats and too few people to adequately patrol made their job \"inadequate\".\nThe claimants say Shell didn't want to shut down the pipes that form the Trans Niger Pipeline because of the company's reliance on them, citing an internal Shell email which says \"sustenance/stability via the TNP [pipeline] is key for our survival\".\n\"From all we have seen in pursuing the Bodo claims, Shell has demonstrated a very worrying lack of care when it comes to the operation of their pipelines in the Niger Delta,\" said Mr Day, the community's lawyer.\nShell said: \"We are in the process of preparing for a trial in May 2015 regarding the Bodo operational spills, at which time internal documents produced by SPDC relating to the Trans Niger Pipeline (TNP) will be set in their proper context for review by the court.\"\n [OUT] ",

In the UK, the first ingredient in a classic Dairy Milk bar is milk. In the United States, where Hershey has the license to make and sell all Cadbury products, the first ingredient is sugar. Ms Madeley says her customers wouldn't buy the US kind even if she stocked it.\nThousands of fans in small shops across the United States and on social media have been urging Hershey to allow them legal access to their favourite British creamy treats. Some have even called for a Boston Tea Party-like protest with plots to throw \"inferior\" chocolates into the nearest body of water.\nSoon the US recipe may be their only choice. Hershey sued LBB Imports, which used to be known as Lets Buy British Imports, for trademark infringement and dilution, arguing that Toffee Crisp's orange packaging was too similar to Reese's peanut butter cups and that Yorkie bars were too confusing to people looking for York Peppermint Patties.\nHershey has the rights in the United States to sell York, Cadbury, Kit Kat and Rolo trademarks as well as Maltesers (so British Maltesers are out too).\nThe lawsuit was settled after LBB Imports agreed to stop importing the disputed products. LBB Imports President Nathan Dulley says he estimates that about $50m worth of British chocolate is sold in the United States each year - a Hershey's Kiss sized drop in the grand scheme of American chocolate sales.\nWhile Mr Dulley says Hershey's case has merit, he thinks it's petty and that Pennsylvania-based Hershey should have allowed the small amount of imports for the niche expatriate market.\n\"We did attempt to make an agreement. Ultimately, these decisions do affect small businesses across the country,\" Dulley says. \"At end of the day you're talking about a $6bn (Â£4bn) behemoth - both businesses should be able to coexist.\"\nHershey executives have said they want to protect their intellectual property and that they'd asked LBB repeatedly to stop importing the disputed chocolates. They have not commented on the social media call #BoycottHershey or the online petitions, including one posted on the White House website.\nMore than 30,000 people have signed the online petitions in protest and on Twitter chocolate lovers are milking the spat to condemn what they feel are chemical-laden, inferior Hershey products.\n\"Shame on you Hershey. Give the people what they want! #boycotthershey Good ingredients trump crap every time,\" read one tweet.\nAnd in stores across the United States, shoppers are buying as much of the so-called proper chocolate they can afford or carry.\nAllen Roberts, who moved from Manchester to California in 1959, was furious at the news and stocking up on chocolates at the Ye Olde King's Head. He reminisced about the Cadbury bars he received as a boy in ration packs during World War II.\n\"Even though Hitler bombed the place up to heck we still got that Cadburys and here we are now, we're not going to get it? That doesn't make sense, does it? Isn't that terrible?\"\nJessica Bailey, a Briton stocking up on chocolates with her husband and son, said she would boycott all Hershey products.\n\"I'm kind of a bit anti-Hershey now and I probably won't buy anything that they make,\" she said. Her husband said if they had a truck they would buy everything in the store.\nPatricia Jane, who moved to Los Angeles from Texas last week, says her British wife is very upset about the ban.\nMs Jane was stocking up on chocolates and said her wife planned to have family in the UK post her chocolates in the future, rather than eat the American kind.\nAs an American, which does Ms Jane prefer?\n\"I like the American kind. It's how I was raised, but she deserves her chocolates too.\"\nFor small businesses like Ye Olde King's Head British Gift Shoppe, Ms Madeley says it will really hurt business, especially during Christmas and Easter.\n\"There will be no real Cadbury chocolates in the Easter baskets,\" she said. \"Children will be crying in the streets.\"\n [OUT] ",

Not only in managing the changes brought about by reform and substantial financial cuts, but most importantly in the public service we provide.\"\nHe acknowledged: \"There remains a lot to do, but knowing as I do the quality of our officers and staff, I am confident that the challenges will be met.\n\"The dedication and commitment of our people is truly outstanding and I know will serve Scotland well in the future under a new chief constable.\"\nPaying tribute to the chief constable, SPA chairman Vic Emery said he firmly believed that Sir Stephen had been \"the right individual at the right time\" to lead Police Scotland through the \"combined challenges of major reorganisation, fundamental reform, and reduced funding\".\nHe added: \"Sometimes the public don't always see the real person behind the public profile. Steve has always been a constable first, and a chief officer second.\"\nSir Stephen, who was previously the chief constable of Strathclyde Police, oversaw the complex amalgamation in 2013 of Scotland's eight regional police forces into the single national force, which is the second largest in the UK.\nSince then, he has overseen successes such as the policing of last year's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\nBut he was criticised over his decision to allow armed officers to attend routine incidents, as well as the force's policy on stopping and searching juveniles.\nThe force is also under pressure over its response to the M9 crash in July in which John Yuill and his partner Lamara Bell died after it took three days for officers to respond to reports of their car leaving the road near Stirling.\nWhen Sir Stephen House was appointed the first chief constable of the new Police Service of Scotland he was credited with being the best candidate because of his \"impressive track record of leadership, partnership working and delivery\".\nThose were the words of the then Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill, who believed Sir Stephen would make \"an outstanding\" chief constable.\nBefore the 57-year-old took on the role in October 2012 - seven months before Police Scotland came into being - he already had an impressive CV of public service both north and south of the border.\nSir Stephen's police career began 34 years ago when he joined Sussex Police.\nHe was a uniform officer between 1981 and 1988, initially working for Sussex and then later transferring to Northamptonshire Police followed by West Yorkshire Police.\nSir Stephen's first taste of high command came in 1998 when he joined Staffordshire Police as an assistant chief constable, initially in territorial policing and later in crime and operations.\nAfter three years in that job he joined the Metropolitan Police Service as a deputy assistant commissioner.\nDespite what he described as his \"estuary English\" accent, Sir Stephen is Scottish, having been born in Glasgow.\nRead more here\nPolice Scotland officers are being investigated by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner over the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died in police custody after being arrested following an incident in Kirkcaldy on 3 May.\nAnd there have also been reports that Police Scotland was one of two unnamed UK forces accused by a watchdog of spying on journalists and their sources.\nSir Stephen had faced calls to resign from opposition politicians in the wake of the controversies, but Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has always insisted she had full confidence in him.\nResponding to his announcement, Ms Sturgeon thanked Sir Stephen for his \"years of dedicated service\" with both Strathclyde Police and Police Scotland.\nShe said: \"Strong policing has ensured recorded crime is at a 40-year low. Sir Stephen provided leadership at a crucial time and his strong focus on tackling violent crime made a major contribution to that achievement.\n\"Reform of policing in Scotland was absolutely vital to sustain the policing upon which Scotland's communities depend and Sir Stephen's contribution to that was invaluable.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who has been a fierce critic of the single force, said Sir Stephen's departure would not by itself solve the \"deep-rooted problems\" in Police Scotland and that the force needed a \"fresh start\".\nHe added: \"Ultimately the SNP government must accept responsibility for this chaos. They rammed through the centralisation of our police service despite warnings. They set up the toothless Scottish Police Authority. They appointed the chief constable.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Sir Stephen was \"bowing to the inevitable\" by resigning, and said it was \"essential that his replacement is up to the task of tackling the problems that have afflicted the single force since its inception\".\nScottish Labour's justice spokesman, Graeme Pearson - who was formerly a senior police officer - said the process of reforming Police Scotland \"can begin now if the SNP government are willing to take responsibility for their mistakes\".\nBut the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said Sir Stephen had made a \"monumental contribution\" to policing.\nThe federation's chairman, Brian Docherty, said: \"He has delivered the most significant public sector restructuring in a generation against a background of a brutal austerity agenda.\n\"He has delivered some very impressive policing results on crimes of violence, particularly domestic violence. I have little doubt that history will prove to be kinder to Sir Stephen than the current commentary which at times has been vindictive and deeply personal.\n\"Many people feared that a single police service could be susceptible to political interference and those who have called for the head of the chief constable as some form of trophy need to consider that.\"\nNiven Rennie, president of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents, said on Twitter that the first chief constable of Police Scotland \"was always going to be on a hiding to nothing\".\nHe also said that critics of the force should \"recognise the great achievements of Police Scotland in its formative years not concentrate on the mistakes.\"\nMr Rennie said Sir Stephen's decision would give the force a chance to rebuild on a \"crazy\" two years, and that he believed a \"change in style will help\".\nMartin Bell, the brother of M9 crash victim Lamara Bell, said: \"It's over to the government now to see what changes they will bring in.\n\"We have no faith in Police Scotland at all and no faith that we will see real change as a result of Sir Stephen standing down.\n\"What happened to Lamara really can't happen again. They need to stop making cuts to emergency services and put as much funding into them as they possibly can.\"\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The grouping - the biggest in one place since the war - took off in waves from Goodwood airfield in West Sussex before dispersing around the region.\nThere was also a memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral attended by veterans.\nHere are some of your pictures and comments.\nCarol Penny, Bognor Regis, West Sussex, UK: We celebrated the flypast at Goodwood. Wonderful atmosphere, folks from all over south England and beyond. What a memorable occasion to see all these planes in one place. The planes and their young brave crews gave their all for us and we should remember and be grateful.\nMike Miller, Pembury, Kent, UK: Living during the war, from the age of six to 12, in the South East suburbs close to London my brother and I witnessed many dogfights and enemy action. Sometimes two or three Spitfires or Hurricanes flew low over the rooftops where we lived. Suddenly we felt absolutely safe. With those chaps around no enemy could touch us. Even today in my 80s I get emotional at the sound of a Merlin engine.\nJohn Parish added that his father was a navigator in the Fleet Air Arm, a memory which \"brings home how brave these men were\". John also filmed the flypast and captured the incredible sound of those engines.\nMichele Sanders, Peacehaven, East Sussex, UK: I didn't get the clearest of photos on Peacehaven Cliff top. But whilst watching three groups of Spitfire planes coming over our way, I did meet a wonderful man of 91 years who had travelled down from Reigate especially to watch the flypast. At the age of 18, he was flying in Lancaster bombers, coincidentally with the same Lincolnshire regiment as my uncle, who had died aged 22 in June 1944 during a night flying exercise over Norfolk. It was amazing to be able to say to one of these brave young men: \"Thank you very much\".\nGeorge Luck, Ontario, Canada: I would have had two uncles. One flew for Bomber Command. He left Canada a promising pianist and flew Lancasters. He never came home again and now lies for eternity under the blue skies in which he flew. My other uncle left Canada as a very young office runner and came home a decorated squadron leader. He flew Spitfires in the skies of England. Though he lived to a ripe old age, when you looked in his blue eyes it was clear that, even 60 years later, he was still a Spitfire pilot. It was men like these from all over the world who came to the aid of the \"Mother Country\" in those dark days.\nBut it wasn't just the male pilots people wanted to remember today:\nDavid Gill, US: I saw the battle of Britain from the ground up as a 14-year-old living in Dorking, Surrey. September 15 1940 was the big day. There was a large air battle over Dorking. We could see the London Docks burning later. But not many bombs were dropped on Dorking. That period was exciting for me as a teenager but the \"flying bombs\" and \"V11s\" that came later were frightening.\nMeirion Underhill, Farnborough, UK: I have just seen six Spitfires fly over. I have seen Spitfires many times since a child as it was my late father's favourite aircraft but never have I seen six.  A moment to remember and a moment to be proud of what our forefathers did to keep this country British.\nNot everyone was happy with the flypast as Terry Quirke in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, UK notes: \"The historic flypast marking the 75th anniversary will be a sight to behold if you live on or around the coast. The bulk of Spitfires were made in Castle Bromwich. In fact, the oldest flying Spitfire was built there.\"\nHe went on to say: \"My mum worked there during that time. It is rather sad that there will be no flypast at all over Castle Bromwich or its locality. It's a shame for the few who are still alive who helped to build these iconic aircraft.\"\nTerry was not the only one who would have liked to see the flypast:\nPeter Stallard was disappointed: I live about three miles from Romford. I just saw five Spitfires way in the distance. I had been waiting since 12 noon. It would have been nice to see them all and closer.\nDoug Murphy, Southampton, UK: I planned my viewing according to the published maps showing where the various groups were due to fly; the one I was due to see went from Goodwood to the Isle of Wight, then up to Salisbury and back to Goodwood. I watched (with many others) just to the east of Fordingbridge, but not a single plane passed over. Ironically, it would appear that had I stayed at home in Southampton I might well have had a perfect view of the re-routed event!\nProduced by Victoria Park\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Mr Stewart, who says he was abused by a coach for four years as a child, said the sport could face allegations on the scale of the Jimmy Savile scandal.\nIt comes as the NSPCC said more than 50 people had rung an abuse helpline within two hours of it being set up.\nIt was launched after four footballers spoke about being abused as children.\nFormer Crewe players Andy Woodward and Steve Walters, and ex-Manchester City player David White, as well as Mr Stewart have spoken out about abuse in the game after waiving their right to anonymity.\nFootball Association chairman Greg Clarke met Mr Woodward on Thursday to discuss the allegations. Mr Clarke told BBC Sport he wanted to ensure potential victims \"felt safe\" to come forward and \"report terrible crimes\".\nAllegations of abuse within football surfaced last week, when Mr Woodward, 43, spoke publicly about his abuse by former Crewe coach and youth football scout Barry Bennell.\nTwo other players who say they were abused by Bennell will also waive their right to anonymity to speak on Friday's edition of the Victoria Derbyshire programme (09:00 GMT, BBC Two). They came forward after seeing Mr Woodward's interview.\nOn Thursday, Manchester City released a statement saying: \"The club is aware of allegations that Barry Bennell had an association with Manchester City Football Club in the 1980s. As a result the club is currently undertaking a thorough investigation of any past links he might have had with the organisation.\"\nAccording to the Guardian, an anonymous ex-footballer has also contacted police to say he was a victim of George Ormond - a former Newcastle United youth coach who was jailed in 2002 for offences against young footballers in the area.\nA spokesman for Northumbria Police told the Guardian it had received an allegation of \"historic sexual offences in Newcastle\" and inquiries were ongoing.\nOrmond was sentenced to six years in prison for sex offences against boys aged between 13 and 21 committed between 1974 and 1994.\nThe judge called him a \"predatory abuser of young boys\" who \"used his position as a football coach to target vulnerable children\" and \"prevented disclosure by the power wielded over them as their coach\".\nMr Stewart, 52, who started his career at Blackpool and also played for Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool, first told the Daily Mirror an unnamed coach - not Bennell - abused him daily for four years up to the age of 15.\nIn an emotional interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Mr Stewart said he believed there were \"hundreds of victims\" of sexual abuse who could come forward.\nHe also claimed:\nMr Stewart said he finally escaped his alleged abuser at the age of 15, signing for Blackpool, where he made his professional debut at 17.\n\"I was told that I had to do these things if I wanted to be a footballer,\" he said. \"I only ever wanted to be a footballer as a child. He was threatening that he would kill my parents and my two brothers if I ever spoke out. I was just absolutely frightened.\"\nAsked if he feared the allegations football is facing could be as big as the Savile scandal, he told the BBC: \"Yes, I do, for sure. I would almost guarantee it as long as the victims are willing to come forward.\"\nAfter his death, former DJ and television presenter Savile was found to be one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators.\nMr Stewart also spoke of the heartache of having to show his family the Mirror story before it was published, saying he had been unable to show his son and two daughters in person.\nHe added: \"This has not been easy for me to do.\n\"But I felt that I needed to do this so other people will come out and with the hope that it may stop anyone who may be thinking of doing it again, in any walk of life - not just football.\"\nHe added: \"The access to children at sport level is very easy and it is the perfect ground for them to prey.\n\"I do believe, in the days it was happening to me, it was a taboo subject, nobody spoke about it. It was brushed under the carpet if it was happening. I don't think there was anywhere to turn in those days.\"\nSports minister Tracey Crouch said the former players had shown \"incredible bravery\" to speak about the abuse.\nShadow sports minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan warned the scandal could \"seriously damage\" UK football's reputation.\nThe NSPCC said callers to the abuse hotline had raised concerns about children now and in the past, and it expected \"many more\" to come forward.\nInformation from 20 callers would be passed to police, the children's charity said.\nManchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney, an NSPCC ambassador, said: \"It's awful that some of my colleagues have suffered this way whilst playing the sport that I and they love. It's important that people know that it's OK to speak out, there is help available and that they don't need to suffer in silence.\"\nBennell was sentenced to nine years in prison in 1998 after admitting sexual offences against six boys.\nHe was a youth coach at Crewe Alexandra in the 1980s and 1990s and also had a close association with Stoke City and Manchester City.\nCheshire Police said 11 people had come forward since Mr Woodward spoke out, including fellow ex-Crewe player Mr Walters, 44, who says he was also a victim of Bennell.\nFormer Manchester City and England player Mr White, 49, says Bennell abused him between 1979 and 1980 while he was playing for Whitehill FC junior team in Manchester.\nSo far, Greater Manchester Police has not received any official reports of abuse but, in a statement, it said any victim should have confidence officers would treat complaints seriously and thoroughly investigate them.\nOn Thursday evening, police were seen at Bennell's address in Milton Keynes, removing a dog and some boxes.\nCrewe's director of football Dario Gradi, who has been associated with the club for more than 30 years, released a statement saying he knew nothing about Bennell's abuse of young footballers until his arrest in the US in 1994.\n\"I knew nothing of his crimes before this time when he was employed by us,\" said Mr Gradi, who managed the club from 1983 to 2007 and for short spells afterwards.\n\"No-one at the football club knew of Bennell's crimes until his arrest in 1994 and his subsequent prosecution in the UK.\"\nHe said he would make no further comment until Crewe had carried out a review.\nThe Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said it expected the number of people coming forward to rise.\nPFA chief executive Gordon Taylor told BBC Sport: \"There's always talk of hidden agendas and cover-ups. I can only speak from my own experience and the PFA's point of view. There's no cover up. It's our business to help players and resolve problems.\n\"We have seen an increase in the number of players to come forward. We can only do our best. There might be youngsters that this caused them not to have a career in the game. We need to encompass the whole lot.\"\nFormer FA chief executive, Mark Palios, told the BBC he was not surprised by the allegations.\nHe said it would be \"naive\" to suggest abuse has not gone on within the game.\n\"It's an issue like racism - you can't be complacent that you've actually dealt with it. But I'm pretty certain that the position today is far better than it was 20 to 30 years ago when it was pretty much un-regulated.\"\nThe FA's head of equality and safeguarding, Sue Ravenlaw, said the \"courage and dignity\" shown by the four footballers who have spoken out was \"immense\".\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] People are used to clashes between moderates and hardliners, and also to tensions between elected presidents trying to implement reform and a conservative establishment resistant to change.\nBut last week, a very public feud opened up between two of the country's most powerful men - the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and the former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, once a close ally but now an increasingly bitter opponent.\nIt is a dispute that raises fundamental questions about what kind of a country the Islamic Republic will be in coming years.\nThe spat began with a tweet sent last week from an account associated with Mr Rafsanjani calling for dialogue and not confrontation with the international community.\n\"Tomorrow's world is a world of dialogue, not missiles,\" the tweet said.\nMr Rafsanjani, who heads the influential Expediency Council is a strong supporter of the moderate president, Hassan Rouhani.\nThe recent victory of both men and their supporters in nationwide elections has put Mr Rafsanjani in a strong position and he's used it to be even more outspoken in his criticism of hard-line opponents.\nThe Supreme Leader, however, clearly saw the missile tweet as a step too far, and fired off a furious and unusually direct riposte.\nThose who say Iran's future lies in negotiations rather than missiles are wrong, Mr Khamenei said.\nIranians who make this argument are either ignorant or traitors, he said.\nThis line was then picked up and repeated by imams leading Friday prayers.\nAt mosques across the country, prayer leaders denounced treacherous views and said those who espoused them should be sacked.\nThey didn't mention Mr Rafsanjani by name, but no-one was in any doubt who they were talking about.\nIn some countries such a sustained attack would signal that an official was about to lose his job, if not his liberty, but in Iran things are more complicated.\nDisagreements between top officials have always been a part of political life in the Islamic Republic.\nThey're often referred to as \"family disputes\", which means they are tolerated up to a point.\nOne good example is the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei himself. He had a notoriously bad relationship with the founding father of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, when Mr Khamenei was Iran's president in the 1980s.\nThe tipping point in such disputes usually comes when someone is no longer seen as part of the family.\nMir Hossein Mousavi, for example, was a former prime minister and key insider, but he's spent the last five years under house arrest after galvanising opposition to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the disputed 2009 presidential election.\nMr Rafsanjani is still a politician to be reckoned with, but in a sign of just how much the dispute has unnerved him, one week on, he suddenly issued a retraction of the tweet that caused all the fuss.\nIt was a comment made seven years ago in an interview with a Dutch film company, he said, and it had been taken completely out of context.\nHe expressed regret at what he called the \"distortion and truncation\" of what he had said.\nAkbar Hashemi Rafsanjani\nThe war of words between the two men looks set to die down for now, but it clearly illustrates the deep tensions at the very heart of Iran's political system over the country's future.\nAyatollah Khamenei and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani are both getting old.\nBoth are starting to think about who will succeed them and how to protect their legacies - and their families - after they have gone.\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei\nAnd the politicians and power brokers around them are starting to think very hard and with some trepidation about how this will affect them too.\nThere is a very great deal at stake, and all the more so because this is all happening at a time of change for Iran as the country begins to open up after the nuclear deal.\nThe appointment of a new Supreme Leader, when it comes, will be nothing short of an earthquake in Iran.\nWhoever controls the office also controls very powerful unelected offices like the Guardian Council, which vets elections and thus wields huge influence over the political landscape.\nAlso at stake is control over the armed forces, judiciary, Expediency Council as well as Iran's gigantic charitable foundations which some estimate make up as much as 50% of the country's economy.\nIn the past, disputes between top officials were usually settled when the Supreme Leader intervened.\nBut this time it's the leader himself who is involved, and the dispute is about his own legacy.\nMany Iranians are now looking back to 1989, when the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini removed his formal successor, the highly respected Ayatollah Montazeri, from his position just a few months before his death.\nThe decision opened up a deep wound in the Iranian system that never really healed. Ayatollah Montazeri was eventually banished to house arrest in the city of Qom, but remained a focus for opposition and dissent in Iran until his death seven years ago.\nObservers point out that in 1989 the Islamic Revolution was still strong and the system was able to recover and move on.\nBut the days of revolutionary fervour are long gone, and many Iranians now fear that the increasingly bitter dispute between their top clerics could plunge the country into chaos from which, three decades on, it would be much more difficult to recover.\n [OUT] ",

That's just not right,\" he said.\n\"I've ordered an immediate investigation to look at the evidence and consider the views of employees, customers and the industry to see how we can deal with the abuse of tipping.\"\nAnalysis by BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam\nRestaurants have the highest corporate mortality rate.\nThey pop up and disappear from our high streets with daffodil-like regularity. That's because consumer tastes can change rapidly but also because profit margins are often very low.\nAdd in high rents and staff costs in Britain's largest cities and restaurants will say they need to maximise every source of income to stay afloat.\nBut consumers tend to side with waiting staff when it comes to tips. They assume staff will see most, if not all of them - especially if customers have been asked to pay an 'optional' service charge of at least 10% on their bill.\nAdding tips to the existing code of practice among restaurants (which is voluntary anyway) may be the solution. But it may be tough to police.\nMost waiting staff are either young or foreign - meaning they don't know the law and don't wish to upset their employers.\nAs part of the investigation information and views from the hospitality industry and other key stakeholders will be sought.\nThis will help the government decide if ministers need to intervene to strengthen the voluntary code of practice.\nUfi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, said the body \"would welcome dialogue with the business secretary on the matter of tipping and the industry code of conduct.\"\nMost chains use a \"tronc\" system, where all the tips are collected together and distributed evenly through the staff, usually with around 70% going to the waiters, and the rest given to kitchen and other workers.\nThere is no law regarding how a tronc is divided, however.\nA spokesperson for Pizza Express said: \"To cover the administrative costs of ensuring that the tronc system is managed correctly and fairly, a small administrative fee of 8% is levied. Under no circumstances does Pizza Express generate additional profit through the tronc.\"\nMany high-street chains deduct fees from tips. These include: Ask (8%), Belgo (10%), Bella Italia (10%), CafÃÂ© Rouge (10%), Prezzo (10%), Strada (10%) and Zizzi (8%).\nRecently Giraffe has scrapped its 10% admin fee on tips, joining chains like Restaurant Group, Carluccio's, Garfunkel's and Jamie Oliver's who do not deduct a fee.\nResearch from 2009 found that one in five restaurants did not pass tips to their staff, yet the vast majority of customers said they wanted waiting staff to receive the money left for them, the government said.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Canadian crooner Michael Buble was due to present - but that's been in doubt since his three-year-old son Noah was diagnosed with cancer last year.\nAt the time, the distraught singer cancelled all future engagements, saying he was determined to focus on caring for his eldest child.\nIt was hoped he'd be able to return for the Brit Awards, but media reports are suggesting he's pulled out for good - and understandably so.\nSo, who could take the helm at the O2 Arena on 22 February? Here are a few suggestions...\nAnt (stands on the left, a bit wacky), and Dec (stands on the right, giggles) were hardly at their best when they hosted the Brits last year.\nThe nadir was the moment when Ant \"mistakenly\" appeared on stage in a dress. Because a man in a dress is hilarious, right?\nComing so soon after a video tribute to androgyny-embracing pop lizard David Bowie, it felt particularly dated.\nBut with a better scriptwriter they're a safe pair of hands - and, crucially, able to draw a big audience.\nBack in 2008 when Katy Perry was a relatively new and untested pop star, she took the helm of the MTV Europe Music Awards in Liverpool and totally stole the show.\nCheeky and energetic, she kept the event moving at a frenetic pace, racing through 10 costume changes and more than a few memorable moments. \"Girls. Just a reminder,\" she said, while riding on top of a giant banana. \"It's not how big the banana is - it's how you sit on it.\"\nWith new music to promote in 2017, could the star be coaxed into a repeat performance?\nIf only so they can go: \"On your marks, get set, DRAKE!\"\nBy hiring Michael Buble, the Brits were making a statement of intent: we want some showbiz, and we want a host a global audience will recognise. Adele is one of the only other stars that fits the bill.\nIn many ways, Adele is the Brits. From the stop-you-in-your-tracks performance of Someone Like You to the moment last year when she tearfully accepted an award from Tim Peake in outer space.\nShe's funny, she's charismatic, and there's 0% chance she'll do it. Which will be a relief for the person who works the bleep button.\nHe's already winning the Brits Icon Award, so they won't need to book an extra cab.\nHis propensity to go off-script might cause organisers a few headaches - but a double-header with his bff Olly Murs would be worth tuning in for.\nBefore he swanned off to become a US chat show host, Corden presented the Brits five times (including a stint with Kylie in 2009). He stood down three years ago, telling the Radio Times he didn't want to outstay his welcome.\n\"There are award shows where it actually becomes a plus that it's hosted by the same person,\" he said. \"But the Brits should always have an energy about them that is fresh and new and exciting.\"\nBut imagine if the whole Brits ceremony was an extended episode of Carpool Karaoke? No pizzazz, no fireworks, no music industry \"suits\" - just a rotating cast of megastars in the passenger seat, with Corden fishing the occasional trophy out of his glove compartment.\nTV Gold.

His UK tour might get in the way of rehearsals but, by coincidence, he has a day off on 22 February.\nIn the year that grime took over the Brits, Julie Adenuga would be a brave but bold choice.\nThe Beats 1 DJ is one of the genre's biggest champions (as well as being sister to three-time nominee Skepta) but eminently knowledgeable about music from all walks of life. Apple Music is also sponsoring two of the awards - best British male and best British female - so there's also a commercial reason to use one of their presenters on the night.\nHowever, she's untested as a live TV presenter, so unlikely to make the cut.\nOn second thoughts, no.\nX Factor host and hot buttered crumpet Dermot O'Leary makes live television look like a walk in the park - when in reality it's a race through a field full of knives, on one leg, in the dark, tethered to an excited donkey.\nAmazingly, he's never presented the Brits, but given his role as a new music champion on Radio 2, he's a perfect fit.\nBig Brother host Emma Willis did a great job fronting the Brits nominations show on Saturday night, attracting a respectable 1.6 million viewers to ITV.\nShe told the BBC she was planning to watch the main ceremony from the audience - but if the call comes, she can recreate her favourite ever Brit moment, when \"Cat Deeley flew in on a champagne bottle\" in 2004.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

I think our highest level is nearly 300\".\nOne all-metal hip device, manufactured by DePuy, a subsidiary of global health giant Johnson & Johnson, called the ASR was recalled in 2010.\nAnd the company, which is facing legal action from ASR patients, has set aside $3bn in case they have to pay compensation.\nBut Mr Nargol's research suggests there are also problems with an all-metal version of DePuy's Pinnacle hip implant, which is still on sale. The Pinnacle has cups which can be lined with metal, ceramic or plastic.\nMr Nargol's hospital tested the nearly 1,000 patients who had been fitted with the all-metal version of the Pinnacle there.\n\"The trust has brought back all the patients with Pinnacle cups - nearly 1,000 - tested them all, screened them, scanned them, and we know exactly what's happening,\" he said. \"And we found out that of about 970 patients, 75 failures related to metal debris, which is really quite high.\"\nDePuy told Newsnight and the BMJ that patient safety is their top priority and that clinical data showed that the Pinnacle was safe.\nThe Newsnight/BMJ investigation has also found that in a bid to prevent dislocation and increase movement DePuy, like other manufacturers, altered its design of the Pinnacle, making the \"head\" larger and part of the \"stem\" shorter.\nHowever, this was done without trials being conducted to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or post-marketing studies to detect any long-term problems and the MHRA was unaware that the design had been changed.\nExperts say it is likely that these design changes are responsible for the release of high levels of toxic metals into the body, yet regulators in the US and Europe failed to spot the changes, and despite concerns being raised, failed to warn doctors and patients of the potential dangers.\nMr Nargol said he first told DePuy about damaged tissue in metal-on-metal Pinnacle patients in 2008.\nAnd e-mails, seen by Newsnight/BMJ, show that Japanese surgeons warned DePuy in 2009 that metal debris from the all-metal Pinnacle was harming patients.\nIn 2010, a senior DePuy executive said in an internal document that he was \"concerned\" about problems with the metal-on-metal Pinnacle and similar implants. \"I feel the problem is emerging as more serious than first thought,\" he wrote.\nThe Newsnight/BMJ investigation shows that in the face of mounting evidence of risk from metal-on-metal hips manufacturers remained silent and regulators failed to act.\nInternal company documents, seen by Newsnight/BMJ, show that as early as 2005 DePuy was aware of the damage that could be done to patients by metal-on metal-implants.\nThis included the possibility that they might increase the chances of patients getting some types of cancer:\n\"In addition to inducing potential changes in immune function, there has been concern for some time that wear debris may be carcinogenic,\" one memo said.\n\"This isn't the unlucky failure to spot the misdemeanours of one rogue company or the occasional unforeseen breakdown of a small number of devices,\" BMJ investigations editor Deborah Cohen, who has been working with Newsnight, said of the findings. \"It is the inability to prevent a whole class of failing hip implants from being used in hundreds of thousands of people globally.\"\nCarl Heneghan, Director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine in Oxford, says that the fundamental problem is that artificial hips, breast implants, and other devices which are implanted in patients do not have to face the same rigorous tests new drugs do.\nHe says that whereas drugs have to go through years of clinical trials \"you could get a device through with a two or three day literature review and no clinical data requirement at the current time\".\nAnd whereas drugs are cleared by a central body, manufacturers of breast or hip implants can choose who they want to approve their new devices. DePuy used the British Standards Institute, known in the UK for applying its \"kite mark\" to products it has approved.\n\"This is one very large uncontrolled experiment exposing millions of patients to an unknown risk. We will only find out about the safety of these devices after large numbers of people have already been exposed,\" says Michael Carome, Deputy Director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a US not for profit consumer advocacy group.\n [OUT] ",

Northern Ireland is in third place for the three subjects.\nWales was behind in all three subjects.\nMaths\nReading\nScience\nSource: OECD\nLaunching the results, Mr Schleicher said the UK spent more in relative terms than most other countries on education. It was also more successful than most at improving the test results of immigrant children.\nBut he said that the test results showed the UK's school system had so far failed to improve as quickly as other countries, such as Poland in eastern Europe and Vietnam in south-east Asia, which are now ranked higher.\nEngland's Education Secretary Michael Gove said: \"These poor results show the last government failed to secure the improvements in school standards our young people desperately need.\n\"Labour poured billions of pounds into schools and ratcheted up exam grades - yet our education system stagnated and we fell behind other nations.\n\"This performance underlines the urgent need for our reforms. Only by learning from other nations and confronting failure at home will we give young people a fighting chance of competing for the jobs of the future.\"\nIn response, Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt said the results showed the importance of high-quality teachers.\n\"This report exposes the failings of this government's schools policy: a policy that has sent unqualified teachers into the classroom and prevented effective collaboration between schools.\"\nMr Hunt said the government was \"charting a course that will make our international standing worse, not better\".\nThe deputy leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, Malcolm Trobe, said it was \"far too early\" for these international tests to show the impact of current education policies.\nMary Bousted, leader of the ATL teachers' union, warned politicians against \"misusing the Pisa results to score political points\" and cautioned that \"everyone needs to remember that PISA is not an exact science\".\nChristine Blower, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said the results showed that successful education systems \"pay teachers well, respect the profession and encourage collaboration between teachers and schools\".\nThere were also voices of caution about how these results should be interpreted.\nProf David Spieghalter from the University of Cambridge said \"we should be very cautious in the lessons to be learned\" - and that measuring quality in education was not straightforward.\nHe also highlighted that while South Korean teenagers were at the top end of test results, they were also the unhappiest about their time in school.\nProf Alan Smithers from the Centre for Education and Employment Research, University of Buckingham said there were many factors outside school that shaped test results.\n\"It is disappointing that the UK's 15-year-olds should come so far down the Pisa tables, but is it the fault of the schools? So many other things affect the scores. In the Asian countries that do so well, there are tiger mothers and a lot of out-of school tuition.\"\nHe said that the UK could boost its position by training students to take the tests, but that was not the same thing as improving the education system.\n\"The danger in the exaggerated importance that politicians attach to Pisa, is that implicitly they are pushing the world to a narrow and particular view of education,\" said Prof Smithers.\n [OUT] ",

The court gave the state six months to write a law legalising it.\nMr Quinn vigorously opposed a concealed carry law, but the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal.\nIn May, the state legislature passed a bill despite his objections. He vetoed the bill, suggesting restrictions on concealed weapons that would satisfy him.\nOn Tuesday, legislators in the House and Senate easily mustered a two-thirds majority needed to override Mr Quinn's veto, barely beating the court deadline.\n\"Following a weekend of horrific violence in Chicago in which at least 70 people were shot and 12 killed, this was the wrong move for public safety in Illinois,\" Mr Quinn said in a statement after the vote.\nHe said legislators had \"surrendered\" to the National Rifle Association, a powerful gun rights lobby funded in part by weapons manufacturers.\nHe warned the new law would allow people to carry guns in pubs and bars, and allow people to carry virtual arsenals on their persons.\nGun rights proponents, meanwhile, celebrated.\n\"This is a historic, significant day for law-abiding gun owners,'' Representative Brandon Harris, a southern Illinois Democrat said, according to the Associated Press.\nReferring to the clause in the US constitution that refers to gun ownership, he said, \"They finally get to exercise their Second Amendment rights.\"\n [OUT] ",

Others in the audience booed him for spoiling the atmosphere and shouted \"Cuba, Cuba, Cuba\".\nPresident Castro was among those attending the service.\nIn his speech at the airport, President Castro said socialist Cuba allowed full freedom of religion and enjoyed good relations with the Catholic Church.\nHe said Cuba shared the Pope's concerns over global poverty, inequality and environmental destruction.\nAnd he stressed that Cuba was determined to defend its independence in the face of the US embargo.\n'New horizons'\nBoth leaders looked back to the visit by the late Pope John Paul II 14 years ago, which Pope Benedict said \"was like a gentle breeze that gave new strength to the Church in Cuba\".\nBy Sarah RainsfordBBC News, Havana\nAt most 10% of Cubans are practising Catholics, but in a politically isolated country like Cuba, this visit is a big event.\nBefore he arrived the Pope criticised Marxism, talking of the need for new models.\nBut greeted here by Cuba's communist president, Pope Benedict referred instead to the island broadening its horizons.\nSome hope this visit can help accelerate reforms in Cuba.\nThe Church is looking to boost its standing and influence in a country where so much is controlled by the state.\nIt is also a chance to revitalise the faith, after four decades of state atheism.\nAhead of his visit, Pope Benedict had suggested Cuba's Marxist structure \"no longer corresponds to reality\" and called for the adoption of a \"new model\".\nBut on his arrival, he recognised Cuba's efforts to \"renew and broaden its horizons\".\nObservers say relations between Church and state have warmed in Cuba in recent years.\nRaul Castro has accepted the Church's mediation on issues such as political prisoners, recognising its position as the most influential organisation outside the communist government.\nThe Pope's visit is seen as an effort to further improve relations and increase the role of the Church in Cuban society at a time of rapid change.\nHis visit to Santiago coincides with the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the icon that is Cuba's patron saint, the Virgin of Charity of El Cobre, which he cited as the main reason for his trip to the island.\nFound floating in a bay in 1612 by fishermen, the icon was revered by Cuba's independence heroes and sits in the foothills of the Sierra Maestra mountains from which Fidel Castro and Ernesto 'Che' Guevara staged the 1959 Cuban revolution.\nThe Pope is expected to make a private visit to the sanctuary where the icon is housed before travelling to Havana later this week for private talks with President Castro.\nChurch officials have said there is no time in his schedule to meet dissidents.\nOpposition groups say dozens of dissidents were detained ahead of the visit, and others were prevented from attending the service in Santiago.\nPope Benedict's trip to Cuba follows a visit to Mexico, where he celebrated a huge open-air Mass at the Christ the King monument in the central city of Silao.\nHe urged the 500,000 Catholics gathered for the sermon to look to their faith in response to poverty and crime and to reject violence and revenge.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Police Scotland is among a number of UK forces investigating allegations.\nJohn Swinney told BBC Scotland he would not extend the Scottish government's inquiry to include football clubs but said that the SFA should consider a review.\nThe SFA said it was \"open minded\" to an independent inquiry.\nA spokesman for the governing body added that any review must have the \"right scope and terms of reference\".\nThe SFA is due to hold a meeting with Police Scotland on Monday to discuss the issue of sexual abuse in football.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Swinney ruled out extending the remit of the government's inquiry looking into the historical abuse of children in care in Scotland.\nHe said: \"I won't do that.\n\"Survivors group want that [the inquiry] to proceed. They don't want the timescale extended, which would be an inevitable consequence of extending into other sectors, whether that was football or any other sector.\"\nBut asked whether the SFA should look at establishing its own inquiry, Mr Swinney said he thought it should.\n\"I think first and foremost the police have got to be given the time and the space to address any complaints made by any individual who has had the whole experience of being affected by child abuse within football,\" he said.\n\"They must go to the police, there are helplines available to assist people to make that contact, and I encourage people to do that.\n\"I think the SFA should recognise the extent of the actions that various clubs have taken individually to examine previous conduct in handling these issues.\n\"But I think the existence of that information is now so widespread that I think the SFA has got to consider setting up an independent inquiry that will satisfy that these issues have been properly and fully addressed by everyone in football.\"\nHe said any inquiry set up by the SFA should be fully \"independent\".\nHe added: \"It should be conducted by an authoritative, independent, respected figure who will be able to look at these issues without fear or favour, and to examine all of the issues to the satisfaction of the wider debate within Scotland.\n\"I think that's a necessity of the current situation that football in Scotland finds itself in.\"\nThe English Football Association has commissioned an independent investigation into the way it dealt with abuse allegations.\nEarlier this week, former SFA chief executive Gordon Smith called for an inquiry into historical sexual abuse.\nHe said it should look at how clubs and national bodies responded to allegations.\nHis comments came after Partick Thistle confirmed that physiotherapist John Hart, who died in 1995, was dismissed from Firhill in 1992 after allegations of abuse were made.\nA BBC Scotland investigation has also revealed that former youth coach and referee Hugh Stevenson was allowed to carry on working in football for several years after being reported to police and the SFA over child sex offences.\nOpposition parties have said the Scottish government, rather than the SFA, should take the lead on any inquiry into abuse in football.\nResponding to Mr Swinney's comments, a Scottish Conservative spokesman said: \"Given the volume of allegations that have emerged over the past week, an independent inquiry is something that should now be considered.\n\"However, there will be questions as to whether the SFA is best placed to lead such an investigation.\n\"A government-instructed inquiry may be a better option to restore public confidence, and would avoid any conflict of interest concerns.\"\nScottish Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said: \"Last week Kezia Dugdale called for the remit of the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry to be extended, which is what survivors' groups want to see.\n\"It is difficult to see how an SFA-commissioned inquiry, effectively into itself, could hold public confidence.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes is now himself under investigation by the House Ethics Committee.\nThe panel is looking into claims that the Republican disclosed classified intelligence.\nMr Nunes called the charges \"entirely false\" and \"politically motivated\".\nHe said his decision to step aside came after \"several left-wing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics\".\nMr Nunes added he would continue to fulfil his other responsibilities as chairman, requesting to speak to the ethics panel \"in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims\".\nDemocrats have criticised Mr Nunes for his handling of the inquiry, which is also looking at possible links between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\nThe House Ethics Committee said in a statement on Thursday: \"The Committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Devin Nunes may have made unauthorised disclosures of classified information, in violation of House rules, laws, regulations, or other standards of conduct.\"\nWatchdog groups Democracy 21 and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington had asked the House ethics panel to investigate Mr Nunes.\nHis political foes have accused him of helping the White House to divert attention from several investigations into links between the Trump team and Russian officials.\nMr Nunes has acknowledged making an after-dark trip to the White House grounds last month that even the congressman's own aides were apparently unaware of.\nThe next day at a hastily arranged news conference he announced he had learned that post-election communications of Mr Trump's team had been monitored by US intelligence agencies as they snooped on foreign officials.\nHe expressed alarm that information about the then-incoming president's aides had been swept up in US intelligence reports.\nMr Nunes' Democratic colleagues on the panel were furious that he had not shared such information with them before going public.\nIn the face of much scepticism, Mr Nunes maintains White House officials were not his original source for the claims.\nDemocrats questioned whether the investigation into Russia's alleged role in the election could proceed objectively.\nIt's never a good sign when the investigator becomes a bigger story than the investigation.\nSuch was the case with Congressman Devin Nunes, with his shifting explanations for where and how he acquired sensitive intelligence documents, his decision to keep details from his fellow intelligence committee members, his apparent behind-the-scenes co-ordination with White House sources and his penchant for dramatic press conferences.\nAll this made him a liability for Republican congressional leadership and the White House. Now he is, at least temporarily, out of the picture.\nHe may blame an ethics complaint filed by \"leftwing activist groups\" for forcing the move, but there's little doubt that many Republicans are breathing a sigh of relief. Mr Nunes, at times, seemed out of his depth on the big political stage.\nThe committee's investigations effectively had been ground to a halt by partisan bickering, and this move is a first step toward rebooting the efforts.\nIt may be too late, however, as the concurrent Senate intelligence committee investigation has launched more smoothly and with a greater show of bipartisan co-operation.\nMembers of the House of Representatives often complain of being viewed as the \"baby brother\" to the upper chamber. The dual Russia probes haven't done much to dispel that notion.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said he fully supported Mr Nunes' decision.\nMr Ryan said he trusts Mr Nunes, but the ehtics inquiry \"would be a distraction\" for the House Intelligence Committee investigation.\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, a ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he respected Mr Nunes' decision.\n\"We have a fresh opportunity to move forward in the unified and nonpartisan way that an investigation of this seriousness demands,\" he added.\nA White House spokesman said in response to the announcement: \"This is an internal matter for the House\".\nTexas Representative Mike Conaway will take over that inquiry with the help of fellow Republicans Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney.\n\"We're going to proceed with the investigation and follow every lead to its logical conclusion,\" Mr Conaway said on Thursday.\nIt is unclear whether Mr Nunes' departure will end the partisan bickering that has brought the committee's investigation to a virtual halt.\nBut a separate Senate Intelligence Committee probe into Russia's alleged role in the US election appeared to be moving forward, conducting its first round of hearings on the issue last week.\nMeanwhile, the FBI also recently acknowledged it is running its own probe into claims of Kremlin political meddling.\nMr Nunes said he plans to return to the House investigation, but he did not provide a timeline.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The 48-year-old former Borussia Dortmund coach has been received by adulation bordering on hysteria since replacing sacked Brendan Rodgers - but now it was time to get down to the football.\nAnd the German declared himself satisfied with a point after his first experience of Premier League football as Liverpool manager.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nKlopp has made much of his desire for \"full-throttle football\" at Liverpool - preferring a \"heavy metal\" approach to the game as opposed to what he called the \"silent symphony\" of passing favoured by Arsene Wenger at Arsenal.\nAnd it will be a style in the manager's own image if the first glimpse of Klopp in the Premier League is anything to go by.\nWhite Hart Lane's press box offers a low-down, close-up view just feet behind the visiting manager - and watching Klopp is a show all of its own.\nHe was at the centre of the action even before the game, standing in the centre circle to see his players warm up before turning his back on them to observe, with equal intensity, Spurs' players going through their paces.\nKlopp made a low-key entrance in front of a bank of photographers before taking his seat. In fact, he took his seat for only 30 seconds and did not return until the 31st minute. And only then for a few seconds.\nEvery piece of pressing, which he so loves, was greeted with applause with hands above his head, while crucial pieces of defensive work were saluted with a clenched fist.\nIt was not all praise though.\nHe turned to Liverpool goalkeeping coach John Achterberg to complain at how they had marked at a corner and teenager Jordon Ibe felt the rough end of Klopp's tongue when he was too slow getting ready to come on as an 87th-minute replacement for Philippe Coutinho.\nKlopp smiled as he engaged Spurs counterpart Mauricio Pochettino in conversation on a couple of occasions in the second half, then turned to embrace Jerome Sinclair at the final whistle as the youngster was denied an appearance just as he was about to come on.\nHe then joined his new Liverpool players in the centre circle before acknowledging the applause of the travelling supporters, both parties delighted to be in each other's company.\n\"I'm satisfied,\" Klopp said of the draw. \"Football is a result sport.\n\"We need all the results, we have to try and improve, work together and do the things together we want to see. The nil on the right side is OK, the nil on the other side doesn't give you the same feeling.\"\nOne of Klopp's first statements of significance as Liverpool manager was to say everyone at the club had to turn from \"doubters to believers\".\nAnd proof of the galvanising effect the charismatic German has had was not only seen in the giant flag bearing his image in the away section, emblazoned with the slogan \"We Believe\".\nOn the trains heading to White Hart Lane out of Seven Sisters - and around the Seven Sisters Road - there was a spring in the step of Liverpool's fans and an air of genuine optimism inside the stadium judging by the noise even before kick-off.\nThere was a staleness to the latter days of Brendan Rodgers' time in charge, on and off the pitch, but this has been lifted by the arrival of a manager who forged an unbreakable bond with supporters at his previous clubs Mainz and Borussia Dortmund.\nLiverpool fans rallied noisily any time their men chased down Spurs' players, especially when Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris was hurried into a second half clearance, knowing this was what they can expect to see more of under their new manager.\nThey rose to team and manager at the final whistle. It may have only been a point at a ground where they won 5-0 on the way to almost winning the league in 2013/14 - but Liverpool's fans had seen enough to justify their early faith in Klopp.\nKlopp has been acquainting himself with all facets of Liverpool life since touching down at John Lennon Airport on a private plane from Dortmund - and discovered another on Saturday.\nAnd this is that he cannot rely on Daniel Sturridge as the England striker was once again missing through injury.\nWith Â£32.5m summer signing Christian Benteke sidelined with a hamstring injury and Danny Ings out for the season with knee ligament damage, the last thing Klopp needed was for Sturridge to suffer a knee problem - a slight one it is said - in a training ground challenge with Ibe.\n\"Afterwards he had a little pain in the muscle - I'm not a specialist for this but we screened him only to be sure,\" said Klopp.\n\"There is a little bit of swelling but nothing serious so we will have to see. I hope on Thursday he will be ready to play.\"\nNo-one questions Sturridge's talent and he proved his importance when fit with two goals in Liverpool's 3-2 win against Aston Villa at Anfield, the final victory for Rodgers.\nThe problem is the number of times the 26-year-old is absent. Can Klopp really be convinced he can count on him? A study of the statistics suggests not, and that is even before the questions about whether the languid striker can fit into his pressing style are answered?\nIn Sturridge's first two seasons at Liverpool, his appearance record was respectable. In 2012/13, after signing from Chelsea, he played 14 league games out of 18 he was available for at a rate of 67.4%.\nSturridge played 29 out of 38 in 2013/14 at a rate of 66.52% - but that has dropped alarmingly since then.\nLast season, plagued by a variety of injuries, Sturridge's ratio was reduced dramatically to 21.93%. He figured in only 12 games out of 38, playing only 750 minutes out of 3,420.\nSturridge took his time returning this season and has been available for three out of nine league games.\nThis rate is going to have to improve significantly as Klopp demands maximum fitness and effort from every player.\nKlopp's \"gegenpressing\" style is well-known - high intensity pressure on opponents.\nIt was clear from the first whistle at White Hart Lane that he is already making this demand of his players - and when Spurs keeper Lloris was chased and hustled into a rushed clearance in the second half, Klopp turned to his backroom team with a huge smile and a clenched fist.\nThe problem Klopp has is whether he has the players to suit this new style and whether they are built to last the pace of a physically taxing system. It takes exceptional fitness to maintain the physical approach Klopp wants for 90 minutes.\nAdam Lallana and Coutinho ran themselves into the ground before being substituted but it may be that the stricken Ings - who Klopp will not see until next season - is the player best suited to what he wants with his busy, tireless style.\nWill Sturridge or Benteke fit the bill?\nThere must be doubts but there was encouragement for 20-year-old Belgium striker Divock Origi as Klopp revealed he wanted to bring him to Borussia Dortmund before he went to Liverpool from Lille.\n\"We are going to have a lot of fun with this player,\" said Klopp. Time will tell.\nKlopp's news conferences promise to be hugely entertaining - but at White Hart Lane he was calm and measured, almost giving off an air of relief that he could talk about a football match after his hectic first few days in the spotlight.\nHe praised his players and understood he had only had three days to work with most of them. The real work will begin this week at Melwood.\nKlopp's smile beamed around the room on several occasions but he was suitably sombre when asked for his thoughts on the death of former Everton manager Howard Kendall, provoking a sadness that has united Merseyside's football community.\n\"I don't have the right words for things like this - give me time\", said Klopp, perfectly understandably.\nEven in this low-key performance, it is clear Klopp will be an exciting addition to the Premier League.\nKlopp's first few days on Merseyside have revealed what cars he likes to drive, where he is going to live, how little he enjoys having his photograph taken while out for a meal - and now we know more of how he will fare as Liverpool's manager.\nFor all the excitement about his appointment, only dreamers would expect him to turn up and transform a team that has struggled this season in a matter of 90 minutes.\nIt was important Klopp avoided defeat, showed something of what Reds fans can expect in the days ahead and also gain knowledge of what he has and what he needs to do.\nKlopp left White Hart Lane with a tick next to all those boxes - so ended a satisfactory day without the dream start of a victory.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] But there's also quite a lot of eagerly-awaited in-house business too: the timetable for elections to the new Brexit and International Trade Committees, and to replace Keith Vaz in the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee.\nAnd when will MPs vote on whether or not to move out of the Victorian Palace of Westminster to allow refurbishment work? And what will the government do about the powers and size of the House of Lords? Some announcement on those issues is apparently brewing behind the scenes.\nHere's my rundown of the week's action:\nThe Commons returns (2.30pm) with Education questions - and after question time, expect the usual post-recess clutch of ministerial statements on issues that have come up since Parliament last sat, three weeks ago. Fracking, anyone?\nThe main legislative action is the debut of the Neighbourhood Planning Bill, which is intended to accelerate the delivery of new homes, and speed up the neighbourhood planning system which will create a locally-decided framework for what development is permitted where - all important components of Theresa May's agenda.\nIt will also aim to simplify the compulsory purchase order process, which can be essential in delivering big and complex schemes. (The bill was originally supposed to cover infrastructure planning, as well, but that section has been dropped, at least for the time being.)\nOne key issue will be the section of the bill designed to ensure that planning conditions which require developers to take action before work starts are only used where strictly necessary - on the argument that they lead to too many delays in new developments.\nThe bill will require that planning permission can't be granted \"subject to a pre-commencement conditions, without the written agreement of the applicant to the terms of the condition\". And the communities secretary will be given the power to make regulations about what kind of conditions \"may or may not be imposed on a grant of planning permissions, and in what circumstances\".\nThe adjournment debate, led by the Conservative Stephen Hammond, continues his campaign for the government to give parents of summer born and premature children the right to defer their start to school. He used a similar debate last year to press ministers for changes.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) Green Party Peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb has a question on strengthening provisions in the Investigatory Powers Bill to protect data relating to trade union and political activities - an appetiser for the report stage debates on the IP Bill, which start on Tuesday.\nThen peers have their first debate on the Wales Bill - this tweaks the constitutional settlement for the Welsh Government, moving from a \"conferred powers\" model to a \"reserved powers\" model - and devolving responsibility for ports policy, speed limits, bus registration, taxi regulation, local government elections, and sewerage; and grant powers over planning permission for smaller electricity generating stations.\nKey issues may be the calls to devolve youth justice, control of air passenger duty, and to create of a separate legal jurisdiction for Wales; and expect attempts to test UK government assurances that the Wales & the Borders rail franchise would be devolved through secondary legislation.\nThe Conservatives' former leader on the Welsh National Assembly, Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, the artist formerly known as Nick Bourne, leads for the government - and he will be responding to speeches from at least four former Welsh secretaries, because the speakers' list already includes Lord Crickhowell, Lord Hain, Lord Murphy of Torfaen and Lord Hunt of Wirral, and there are even rumours that a fifth, Lord (William) Hague might pop up as well. Someone ought to coin a collective noun.\nThat is followed by a debate on the report from the Lords Select Committee on Sexual Violence in Conflict.\nThis calls for a new tribunal to deal with allegations of sexual violence or exploitation by peacekeeping forces, the involvement of women in all peace negotiations - including in Syria - and provide funding to support their participation. And the report urges the government to ratify and implement the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence at the earliest opportunity.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Health questions - followed, probably, by more ministerial statements.\nThen comes an interesting Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour MP Conor McGinn. His bill seeks to introduce \"Helen's Law\" which would see killers kept behind bars until they reveal the whereabouts of their victims' bodies.\nAt the moment, English law does not require a convicted murderer (at the end of their determined sentence) to admit guilt or reveal the location of a victim's remains before being released.\nMr McGinn's constituent Marie McCourt has been campaigning for Helen's Law following the murder of her daughter Helen in 1988 - her killer has refused to reveal the whereabouts of Helen's body - denying her family the chance to grant her the dignity of a funeral and resting place.\nIn effect his bill would impose a whole-life tariff for murderers who refuse to disclose the location of their victims and enable their remains to be recovered to give families a chance to pay their last respects. It would not affect convicted killers' ability to maintain their innocence, as they would still be able to use the full appeals process.\nThe day's main legislating is the second reading of the Small Charitable Donations and Childcare Payments Bill which makes changes to the Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme, including removing requirements that prevent newly formed charities from making claims.\nThe adjournment, led by Labour's Holly Lynch - a member of the all-party parliamentary group on policing, is on police officer safety - she is concerned about an increase in assaults on police officers and unsafe staffing levels - and she recently shadowed officers on an evening shift, where she saw the dangers they face when responding to incidents on their own.\nIn Westminster Hall, the debates cover forced organ removal in China, the future of Coventry Football Club, the reintroduction of the Royal Yacht Britannia to boost international trade, and HS2 in the North West of England. But the one to watch may be the former immigration minister, Mark Harper, who went on to be chief whip, and has now returned to the backbenches, talking about immigration policy and the disability employment gap after the EU referendum.\nHe recently suggested employers should be challenged about taking on people with disabilities, rather than hiring people from abroad.\nOn the committee corridor, there are three good hearings in an otherwise humdrum week: first up is the Business Committee hearing on industrial strategy, with three heavyweight witnesses: former BIS Secretaries Vince Cable and Michael Heseltine plus the former Chancellor, George Osborne.\nThen, watch out for the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs hearing (9.45am) on the role and effectiveness of ACoBA and the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests - this is the body charged with preventing the \"revolving door\" between government office and commercial employment by people former minister had previously dealt with...the witnesses include Alexandra Runswick of Unlock Democracy and Ian Hislop, the editor of  Private Eye (at 10.45am).\nFinally, the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, and Tim Farron, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, are before the Home Affairs Committee (2.15pm) to talk about anti-Semitism.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) two more beneficiaries of David Cameron's resignation honours list take their seats as peers: Baroness Sugg, Liz Sugg, former Head of Operations at Downing Street, and Baroness Cavendish of Little Venice, the journalist Camilla Cavendish, best known for her campaign to open up family courts to media reporting.\nAfter questions, peers get to the crucial stage in their detailed consideration of the Investigatory Powers Bill - with the first of three days of report stage debate.\nLabour's Baroness Hayter and Lord Rosser have an amendment down to remove the home secretary's power to make regulations under the bill, and there is a battery of amendments down from several  Lib Dem peers. They look set to press an amendment from Lady Hamwee and Lord Lester, which toughens up the wording of the restrictions on use of interception techniques.\nBut my sense is that any danger of a government defeat is rather draining out of this bill - the compromise agreed in the Commons between government ministers and Labour's (then) shadow minister Kier Starmer suggests Labour peers will probably not seek to fricassee this measure in the manner of other recent bills, and without Labour weighing in, the government will not be in danger, however hard the Lib Dems try.\nThere will also be a short debate on the quality and affordability of housing in the UK, led by Labour's Baroness (Joan) Bakewell of Hardington Mandeville\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am for Scotland questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time. After a masterful debut in July, Theresa May followed up with two below par performances, as Jeremy Corbyn upped his dispatch box game,\nThe day's Ten Minute Rule Bill from Conservative Barrister Alex Chalk is on Stalking (Sentencing) - Mr Chalk has argued for a series of detailed improvements to various aspects of the criminal law, and this time he wants to increase the maximum sentences available to the court for stalking offences.\nThe day's main debate will be on a Labour motion to be announced.\nIn Westminster Hall, the debates will cover relations between Britain and Iran (led by the Conservative, Seema Kennedy, a member of the increasingly active all-party group on Iran), the future of the European Medicines Agency, government plans to restrict tax credits to two children and the potential effect of the UK leaving the EU on UK tourism.\nIn the Lords (3pm), the main event is the start of report stage consideration of the Bus Services Bill - where Labour plan to press a series of amendments to ensure that the extra powers to run bus services by adopting a franchise model of delivery are available to all local authorities, if they feel it's in the best interests of local communities, and are not restricted to those with elected mayors.\nThey argue that many rural areas will probably not acquire elected mayors for years, but have an urgent need for better bus services, and should not be made to wait. They also want to remove a clause (21), which would prevent local authorities setting up their own company to run services, arguing that existing municipal bus companies are some of the best in the country, and the option of setting up more should remain open; and they want to protect bus routes as assets of community value in the same way as pubs can be, so a local community can stop a route being axed if it brings real benefits.\nFrontbencher Lord (Roy) Kennedy of Southwark, is clearly relishing the chance to \"speak up for the countryside\".\nAnd that is followed by a debate on the BBC's new charter - among the speakers will be the former Chair of the BBC, Lord Patten of Barnes.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions, and then mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission, the Public Accounts Commission and the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission.\nWith the promise of the Great Repeal Bill to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act to pave the way for Brexit, (Theresa May told her party conference it would come in the next Parliamentary session, starting next May, but might a draft version be put out for pre-legislative scrutiny?) plus the suggestion of a free vote on airport expansion in the south-east of England (ie Heathrow vs Gatwick) there will be more than the usual level of interest in the Business Statement from the new Leader of the Commons, David Lidington. MPs will want to know when these goodies are coming.\nThe main debates are on two subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - the first is Baby loss which will be led by MPs Antoinette Sandbach and Will Quince, who have both spoken in debates about their experience of infant death and stillbirth. (You can read Mr Quince's debate on bereavement care in maternity units here; Ms Sandbach's contribution to the debate is here.)\nThe second debate is on the inquiry into hormone pregnancy tests - an Expert Working Panel Group Inquiry was set up by the government to assess the evidence on children born with serious deformities due to hormone pregnancy test drugs taken by expectant mothers between 1953 and 1975; and the motion before MPs \"notes with concern\" that its terms of reference do not clearly allow for an investigation into the systematic regulatory failures of government bodies at the time and warns that some  panel members have a conflict of interest. It says that unless changes are made, the ability of the inquiry to achieve a fair outcome will be \"significantly compromised\".\nMeanwhile in Westminster Hall (1.30pm) there's a debate on the tobacco control plan - Alex Cunningham, Norman Lamb and Flick Drummond lead.\nThe Committee Corridor highlight is Boris Johnson's debut as foreign secretary before the Foreign Affairs Committee (9.15am). There should be plenty to talk about.\nIn the Lords (11am) another new peer arrives - Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate - the former leader of the Conservative MEPs, Timothy Kirkhope.\nThen, after question time, there will be two backbench debates. First, peers debate government proposals for the extension of grammar schools and selection in education. Actual legislative follow-up for Theresa May's new pro-grammar policy is probably some way off, but listen out for the markers thudding down.\nThe second debate is on the cultural, civic and educational significance of local libraries and independent bookshops in the UK from Lord Bird.\nNeither House is sitting.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Following his Golden Globes triumph, Eddie Redmayne is expected to get a best actor nod for Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything.\nOther British acting talent in the mix could include Benedict Cumberbatch, David Oyelowo, Felicity Jones, Rosamund Pike and Keira Knightley.\nThe shortlists are revealed in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, at 1330 GMT.\nUnder the current voting system, the best picture category could have anything between five and 10 films. For each of the last three years, nine films have made the cut.\nThe shortlist is likely to include dark satire Birdman, coming-of-age drama Boyhood, quirky comedy The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Theory of Everything and another British biopic, The Imitation Game.\nOther films jostling for position include civil rights story Selma, jazz drumming indie hit Whiplash, Iraq war thriller American Sniper and wrestling drama Foxcatcher.\nCaroline Frost, entertainment editor of The Huffington Post UK, says this year looks set to be a tight race, with some casualties among the early favourites.\n\"The whole vibe has changed going into awards season,\" she says.\n\"Films that people thought would have been shoo-ins - like Interstellar, Unbroken or Selma - set awards bells clanging.\n\"But instead more interesting, idiosyncratic films, like Boyhood, Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel, have put their noses in front.\"\nBoth Boyhood and The Grand Budapest Hotel were released in the first half of 2014 - long before the autumn/winter months, when movie bosses like to bring out their awards hopefuls.\n\"The fact that Boyhood and Grand Budapest came out so early in 2014 may give studio execs pause for thought about their distribution model,\" observes Frost.\n\"Maybe it's not such a guaranteed goal-scorer to save up your best films for November or December, because they get caught in the rush.\n\"As audiences and voters, we are so aware of being sold products these days that we feel warm towards films that we discover for ourselves, that don't have that awards ribbon wrapped round them.\"\nIn the acting categories, Redmayne is likely to find himself up against his friend and fellow Brit Cumberbatch, who plays computer pioneer Alan Turing in WW2 drama The Imitation Game.\nPerhaps his biggest challenger will be Michael Keaton, who has resurrected his career in surreal dark comedy Birdman in the role of a washed-up superhero actor who is starring in a play on Broadway.\nBoth Redmayne and Keaton won Golden Globes for their roles this week in separate categories. At the Oscars they will be going head to head.\nOther actors who could make the shortlist include David Oyelowo (Selma), Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler), Bradley Cooper (American Sniper) and Steve Carell (Foxcatcher).\nAnother Golden Globe winner hoping for Oscar success is Julianne Moore, who plays a linguistics professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's in Still Alice. Her powerful performance has made her the bookmakers' favourite to win an Oscar for best actress.\nHer rivals could include Redmayne's co-star Felicity Jones, Gone Girl's Rosamund Pike and Reese Witherspoon, who plays a woman who undertakes a gruelling hike in Wild.\nThere's much speculation that Jennifer Aniston could appear on the shortlist for her role as a woman struggling with prescription painkiller addiction in Cake.\n\"If Jennifer Aniston has ever had a chance of winning an Oscar, it's got to be this year,\" says Frost.\n\"But I think it's Julianne Moore's year, because she's never won an Oscar before and it's her time, as they say, and she's done something worthy of it.\"\nIn the supporting actress field, Golden Globe winner Patricia Arquette (Boyhood) is almost guaranteed a nod, alongside Keira Knightley (The Imitation Game) and Birdman's Emma Stone.\nIf Meryl Streep makes the list for her turn as a fairytale witch in musical Into the Woods, it would be her 19th acting nomination - breaking her own Oscar record.\nExpect to see JK Simmons, who plays a terrifying music teacher in Whiplash, in the mix for best supporting actor alongside the likes of Edward Norton (Birdman) and Mark Ruffalo (Foxcatcher).\nAfter storming the Baftas with 11 nominations last week, though, will The Grand Budapest Hotel do as well with Academy voters?\n\"It will probably do very well,\" writes The Hollywood Reporter's Oscars analyst Scott Feinberg. \"But I'm not sure that it will resonate nearly as much with the American-heavy Academy as it has with voters abroad.\n\"It has a very particular style and dry sensibility that I think Europeans appreciate more than Americans.\"\nFeinberg thinks Richard Linklater's Boyhood is the one to beat in the race for best picture. \"Quite simply, it stands out, with its unique narrative, in a year in which few other films do, and I'd be very surprised if its momentum stops anytime soon.\"\nFrost agrees. \"This film has been around for 12 years and there won't be a film like this to vote for again, possibly ever. It's a once-in-a-lifetime accomplishment.\"\nThe nominations in all 24 Oscar categories will be announced by actor Chris Pine, Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs and directors Alfonso Cuaron and JJ Abrams, on 15 January.\nThe two-part live news conference at the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theatre in Beverly Hills will be streamed live on the BBC News website.\nThe Oscars ceremony takes place in Hollywood's Dolby Theatre on 22 February.\n [OUT] ",

Few would disagree with that motive, and even Tim Cook has acknowledged the compelling moral argument for unlocking the phone.\nBut if there's one things Americans worry about more than terrorists, it's the erosion of their constitutional rights. In Apple's court motion on Thursday, the company ticked the biggest box of all: freedom of speech.\nThe code it writes, the company argues, is the company's speech, it's expression.\nForcing it to write code and create a \"GovtOS\" - a play on iOS, the software that powers the iPhone - would be forcing Apple to write code it disagreed with, the company says.\nIt may be the argument that tips the balance in the court of public opinion.\nApple's boss hits back at FBI conduct\nBill Gates calls for terror data debate\nApple v the FBI - a plain English guide\nOn Thursday FBI director James Comey, said the government's dispute with Apple was, \"the hardest\" he had faced in government.\nTestifying before congress Mr Comey said: \"This is the hardest question I have seen in government and it's going to require negotiation and conversation.\"\nThe row between Apple and the FBI blew up last week when the bureau asked the electronics firm for help to unlock the smartphone of Syed Rizwan Farook - who along with his wife killed 14 people in December 2015.\nSo far, Apple has refused to unlock the phone.\nIn an interview aired yesterday with US TV network ABC, Apple boss Tim Cook said the FBI was asking it to make \"the software equivalent of cancer\".\nHe added: \"Some things are hard and some things are right. And some things are both. This is one of those things.\"\nApple has argued that the FBI's request violates its constitutional right to freedom of speech, because a 1999 court case ruled that computer code is considered speech.\nBy forcing Apple to create a new code the FBI was violating a constitutional right, the company said.\nApple's attorney, Bruce Sewell will testify before Congress on 1 March about the encryption case.\nTech leaders, including Google's boss, and Apple customers have praised the company for standing up to the FBI.\nApple supporters rallied in front of the company's stores on Tuesday to show their support.\nA Department of Justice court filing from February accused Apple of refusing to help to boost its \"marketing strategy\".\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] But the sixty-minute session in which Facebook's founder was first interviewed by a journalist from Wired, then joined on stage by three mobile operators, was one big yawn, a missed opportunity.\nOkay, the subject of the session - Facebook's mission to get people in the developing world online via something called internet.org - was not, on the face of it, controversial.\nAnd Mr Zuckerberg was allowed to paint his business, in that typically happy-clappy Californian way, as motivated only by a desire to enrich more lives through an internet connection.\nBut there are some nagging questions to be asked about internet.org. It may sound great that mobile phone users in Kenya, for instance, are getting free internet access to sites like Wikipedia, one local Kenyan news site, BBC Swahili - and, of course, Facebook.\nBut who acts as the gatekeeper for this walled garden - and what about those other local news sites that aren't on the site and have to charge for access?\nAnd what price net neutrality in Africa? A two-speed internet has just been ruled out in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission. But the laudable mission of internet.org could end up creating fast lanes for those deemed worthy by Mr Zuckerberg and his lieutenants.\nThen there's the thorny question of Facebook's relationship with mobile phone operators. It was amusing to reflect that the three mobile companies represented on the stage could probably be gobbled up for breakfast by the hugely wealthy social network without a second thought.\nMobile networks are seeing their revenues threatened by messaging apps like WhatsApp, bought by Facebook a while back. Meanwhile, they are still much more heavily regulated - Deutsche Telekom's boss made a call in Barcelona for internet firms to face the same level of regulation.\nBut on stage the mobile operators joined in the love-in, praising Mr Zuckerberg's campaign for increasing the flow of data across their networks.\nFacebook's founder was briefly asked about regulation. His answer, somewhat bizarrely for the chief executive of a major communications company, was that he did not understand the subject - \"I'm not a regulator\".\nHe kept repeating this phrase and was allowed to laugh off the very idea that regulation was anything to do with him.\nThe self-congratulatory session ended with little light shed on how the fractious relationship between the social network and the companies which have built the internet's infrastructure might develop.\nBut some time soon - just as Google has already discovered - the regulators will come knocking. Mr Zuckerberg will need to have some answers then.\n [OUT] ",

Crowds lined the streets in Windsor, church services were held in her honour, and the Queen took part in a walkabout at Windsor.\nWhile her 91st was a more private affair, there was a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park and 21-gun salute in Windsor Great Park at midday, ahead of a 62-gun salute at the Tower of London at 13:00 BST.\nThe event at Windsor - where the Queen is believed to be currently staying - was different to most military salutes however, with children chosen to fire the 1ft (0.3m) cannons.\nWhile it is not known what the Queen has received for her 91st birthday, she is known to favour practical gifts over more extravagant presents.\nHer children have given her items including a casserole dish and apron over the years, while the Duchess of Cambridge made her some chutney for Christmas - following her own grandmother's recipe.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 1 on Friday, the Duke of Cambridge admitted it was \"quite hard to know what to get\" his grandmother \"that she hasn't already got\".\nHe said now \"the great-grandchildren can make stuff\", which \"goes down really well\", adding that three-year-old George is \"very good at arts and craft\".\nMany of her favourite presents over the years have reflected her love of animals.\nWhen she was four, the Queen's grandfather King George V gave her her first horse, a Shetland pony called Peggy.\nAnd when she was 18, she was given a corgi called Susan, sparking a lifelong affection for the dog breed.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The Northern Ireland Affairs committee said the \"one-sided, secretive scheme of  letters\" sent to over 180 Irish republicans should never have existed.\nIt came to light when one letter caused the Hyde Park bomb trial to collapse.\nThe On The Runs (OTRs) were republicans suspected of involvement in terrorist crimes but who had never been charged.\nThe scheme involved the provision of so-called \"comfort letters\" by the government designed to give them assurances that they were not being sought by police.\nOne of those who held a letter was John Downey who had been accused of the murders of four soldiers in the IRA Hyde Park bomb in 1982.\nThe report published on Tuesday said the people of Northern Ireland had been \"kept in the dark to the greatest possible extent\".\nIt said the lawfulness of such letters was questionable.\nAnyone already convicted of paramilitary crimes became eligible for early release under the terms of the Northern Ireland Good Friday agreement of 1998.\nThe agreement did not cover:\nâ¢ Anyone suspected of, but not charged with, paramilitary offences committed before the Good Friday Agreement.\nâ¢ Those who had been charged with offences but who had escaped.\nâ¢ Those who had been convicted of offences but who escaped.\nCommittee chairman Laurence Robertson, MP, said the scheme had caused \"further hurt to people who have suffered far too much already\".\nHe said  victims of the Troubles and their relatives had been \"let down\" by the government.\n\"If any scheme had been put in place at all, which is questionable, it should have been properly introduced and correctly administered,\" he said.\n\"It also should have been open and transparent. This scheme was none of those things.\"\nMr Robertson said the government must ensure that no letter provided \"a shield from prosecution ever again\".\n\"That is the least people can expect and is the minimum our committee requires,\" he said.\nThe government letters were addressed to republican paramilitary suspects, informing them that they were not being sought by the police for questioning about Troubles-related offences.\nThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee launched its inquiry after one of the letters resulted in the collapse of the trial of a man charged with four murders.\nJohn Downey was one of more than 180 republicans who were given letters telling them they were not wanted by the police. But he was wanted by the Metropolitan police\nEven though his letter was sent by mistake, a judge ruled that it would be an abuse of process for him to stand trial for the murders of Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young on 20 July 1982 in the Hyde Park attack.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) was blamed for what was described as a catastrophic mistake.\nUnionists reacted with outrage. First Minister Peter Robinson said the letters were get out of jail free cards. He said they were unlawful and should be rescinded.\nDuring its public evidence sessions held in the House of Commons, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee questioned a number of serving and retired senior politicians.\nThey included former prime minister Tony Blair, who rejected claims that the letters were unlawful and said the scheme was essential for the success of the peace process.\nIn its report, the committee said it was questionable whether the OTR scheme was lawful, but said its existence had distorted the legal process.\nThe report's authors said the integrity of both the criminal justice system and parts of the government had been damaged by the stay on the Downey case.\nThe committee said no letters should have been sent out by the Northern Ireland Office.\nIt recommended that all steps should be taken to ensure that OTR letters have no legal effect.\nThe report said the public had been \"deceived\" and that transparency was key to public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system.\n\"It is clear the intention was that the people of Northern Ireland and other political parties were kept in the dark about the scheme to the greatest possible extent,\" it said.\nThe report said that during the peace process, Sinn FÃ©in had pushed for OTR letters at the highest level and promises had been made by the prime minister.\nIt said Mr Blair put much effort into ensuring those promises were kept, but did so without telling other Northern Ireland party leaders about the exact nature of the scheme.\nThe report also accused the Irish government of \"trying to persuade HM government to introduce an amnesty for republican terrorist suspects\".\nIt said that if the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had known about the entire scheme and had been involved in checking letters sent to OTRs, then \"it is almost certain that the Downey judgment could have been prevented\".\nIt also stated that the availability of the scheme to one section of the community \"at the whim of one political party\" raised questions about equality rules in Northern Ireland.\nThe report said the PSNI believes 95 of those who hold OTR letters could be linked to nearly 300 members and that the Metropolitan Police wished to speak to some of them.\nIt called on the government to provide the resources to enable police to reassess those cases quickly.\nPSNI chief constable George Hamilton welcomed the report's acknowledgement that \"speeding up the scheme in 2007 made it more difficult for thorough and competent reviews to be carried out and that the PSNI knew nothing about the content of letters sent to suspects until December 2011.\"\nSpeaking to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee last September, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the government was no longer standing by the On the Runs letters.\nShe said those who received letters should no longer rely on them as a defence.\nLast July, a separate review into the scheme by Lady Justice Hallet found that it was flawed but not an amnesty for those who received letters.\nThe judge found the administrative scheme was kept 'below the radar' due to its political sensitivity, but said it would be wrong to characterise the scheme as \"secret\".\n [OUT] ",

At times of possible unrest, the internet in Iran has almost come to a halt.\nAs well as phishing campaigns, BBC Persian has seen many recent complaints on Iranian social media sites that the internet has become extremely slow.\nBut if this is indeed an attempt by the authorities to block the flow of information into and out of the country, then it doesn't appear to be working. Over the past few days BBC Persian has received many emails, photographs and videos from people inside Iran charting the final days of the election campaign.\n\"The timing and targeting of the campaigns suggest that the attacks are politically motivated in connection with the Iranian presidential election on Friday.\"\nMr Grosse said victims targeted in the attacks had received an email containing a link to a web page purporting to perform account maintenance.\nIf they clicked the link, they were taken to a fake Google sign-in page, which would steal their username and password.\nThe threat was detected by a phishing detection feature added to the firm's Chrome web browser in 2012.\nMr Grosse warned Iranian users to take extra measures to protect their accounts from \"state-sponsored attacks\".\nIn the latest case, users received a message which appeared to come from Google itself using the official-looking address: email.settings@gmail.com.\nIt suggested they assign an extra email address to their existing Google account to make password recovery easier.\nThe bogus link they were asked to click also contained the search firm's name adding to the appearance of authenticity, Google says.\nHowever, the attempt was spotted by a Safe Browsing feature added to Google's Chrome browser last year.\nMost of the six candidates in Friday's election are conservatives close to Ayatollah Khamenei.\nThe opposition says more than 80 of its supporters were killed in a crackdown over a period of six months after the 2009 election - a figure the government disputes.

We're at the start of something really special,\" Andy Stroomer, from Airbus in Stevenage, told BBC News.\nStill being worked on in Pathfinder's big cleanroom are Esa projects worth more than a billion euros in total.\nThese are satellites to visit the Sun and observe the Earth.\nAnd just a stone's throw away is a brand new facility under construction which will house the assembly of the robotic rover that Europe plans to send to the surface of Mars in 2019.\nThe two parts of Lisa Pathfinder heading out of Stevenage comprise the main satellite and the propulsion unit that will push it away from Earth to begin its mission.\nAt the moment, the spacecraft's all-important science instrument package is absent. This will be installed in the coming weeks at IABG.\nLisa Pathfinder is a demonstrator for a future satellite idea that Europe hopes to launch in the 2030s.\nThis is a concept known as the Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (Lisa), which will endeavour to detect gravitational waves.\nEinstein's theory of general relativity predicts that these ripples in the fabric of space-time should be generated when massive objects like black holes coalesce and merge.\nAnd although the signal is expected to be extremely faint, it should still be apparent to an ultra-stable, super-fine measurement system. The Pathfinder's job is to prove the metrology.\nTo do this, it will try to put two small gold-platinum blocks into a perfect free-fall and then track their relative movement using lasers.\nThe intention is to get these blocks following a line that is defined only by gravity. To do that requires that all other forces that might interfere with the demonstration are removed.\nThis means, for example, carefully controlling the influence of temperatures and magnetic fields. Even the vacuum state will introduce \"noise\" into the system if some residual gas molecules are allowed to collide with the blocks.\nThe experiment has been designed such that disturbances to the blocks as small as just a few picometres should be noticed. One picometre is a small fraction of the width of a hydrogen atom.\nCesar Garcia is the European Space Agency's project manager on Lisa Pathfinder. He describes the satellite as perhaps the most exquisite ever built.\nHe said: \"The final objective is to be convinced that we can achieve and then measure a pure geodesic motion. That is, a motion subject only to the Riemann tensor - to the curvature of space-time.  This is what we aim to do - to work on the noise sources, to suppress the noise sources, to learn the noise sources; and then what remains must be a straight line.\"\nIt is in these conditions of perfect free-fall that one would look for gravitational waves. Lisa Pathfinder itself cannot sense them, however.  The ripples produced by merging black holes are at too low a frequency.\nBut if the methodology is scaled up as proposed for the Lisa mission proper, with precision measurement of blocks separated by millions of km, the very delicate signal ought then to show itself.\nDavid Southwood was the director of science at Esa in 2004 when the agency contracted Airbus to build Lisa Pathfinder.\nNow on the steering board of the UK Space Agency, he was present on Friday to see the spacecraft modules packed up ready for the transfer to IABG.\nHe told BBC News: \"It's a fascinating mission right at the frontier of understanding and it could lead one day to the detection of gravitational waves in space. But these technologies don't need to be used just to measure gravity. It's in the nature of things that once you've pushed something to the extreme for a particular purpose, another smart person is inspired to take those ideas and put them to use in another application. What that is, no-one can predict. That's the beauty of it.\"\n [OUT] ",

What can we do?\"\nOn other days, they were stuck at school while shots rang out around them.\nThe outbreaks of violence in Mare were so frequent this year that the local authorities shortened the school day to lessen the risk of students being caught in crossfire between gangs and the police.\nClasses now start at 08:00 rather than at 07:15, and finish at 11:30.\n\"Seven AM is critical because police change their shifts, so that's when the shooting starts,\" explains Glauce Arzua, campaigns coordinator at ActionAid, a non-governmental organisation which works with local organisations to defend residents' rights.\nBut the new timetable means that students miss 75 minutes each class a day, a big setback to their education, Ms Arzua argues.\nComplexo da Mare is home to about 140,000 people.\nLast year, ahead of the World Cup, security forces occupied the area to implement the state's \"pacification policy\", which seeks to establish a permanent police presence in the area.\nBut the twins' mother, 46-year-old Sirlene da Silva says the \"pacification policy\" has actually increased tension in the area and clashes have become more frequent.\nMs Silva is on the minimum wage (around $250; ÃÂ£168 per month) and cannot afford to send her children to a private school in a safer area, so the family has little choice.\n\"We live in the crossfire,\" she says. \"There's violence from criminals and violence from the police.\n\"When the police come in, they shoot first and ask questions later.\n\"When there are police operations, the kids can't go to school, the teachers can't come to class and the residents can't go to work.\"\nThe Rio authorities say extra classes are held to compensate for violence-generated gaps, and assure all schools fulfil the 200-day school year.\nBut the problem goes far beyond timetables.\nRoberta de Sousa, 38, has been a teacher in a state school in Mare for eight years.\nShe says the frequent outbreaks of violence seriously undermine the children's performance and self-esteem.\n\"They go to school hoping it will lead to a better life, but instead, violence invades the walls. They feel that here, too, they are abandoned as citizens and aren't entitled to their basic rights,\" she explains.\nMs Sousa says she has had to switch classrooms or seek refuge in the school corridors for fear that bullets would come through the windows.\n\"I've had to teach literature with a shoot-out raging outside. It's not easy.\"\nShe is one of the teachers trained through a partnership between the state of Rio and the International Committee of the Red Cross to reduce the impact of violence on education.\nSince 2009, the programme has been training teachers to deal with the violence which surrounds the pupils in both practical and psychological terms.\nThis ranges from drills on how to stay safe during shoot-outs to debating problems in class.\n\"Children don't talk about violence openly for fear of being punished,\" says Patricia Tinoco from Rio state's education office.\n\"We create a room for dialogue and this helps them deal with fear and understand what's happening.\"\nShe says that while pupils' performance has been consistently below average in troubled areas, the programme has led to improvements.\nMeanwhile, Samir and Samira dream not only of their future careers but also of earning enough money to be able to leave Complexo da Mare and move somewhere safer.\nTheir mother hopes the constraints they are currently living under will not affect their chances of achieving their dreams\n\"I can't offer my children the education they deserve,\" she says. \"It's a huge disadvantage but I have to have faith the situation will improve, or else nothing will make sense.\"\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] This issue hit me with both barrels between the eyes this week when I had to wrestle with a series of images from besieged Aleppo.\nThey had been taken by Syrian doctors in an underground hospital and forwarded to me by Dr David Nott, the pioneering war surgeon who has been using social media to teach his colleagues over the internet how to, for example, rebuild a man's face.\nI first covered war in 1988 and I've seen more than enough real horror with my own eyes.\nBut the Aleppo hospital pictures were grim beyond the saying of it. Be warned. What I must write and you will now read is a terrible litany of suffering.\nThey include a boy, so coated in cement dust I can't say whether he is alive or dead; a boy, dead; two boys, lying on the floor next to a drain because there are no beds left, both dead; a boy, alive, his face a river of blood; a boy, alive, holding up his broken arm; a boy, dead; a girl with ginger hair, dying.\nA boy, his face white from dust apart from a smear of blood running from his eyes to his nose; the 17th, a baby girl, dying; a teenage girl in a white headdress, it and her face splotched with arterial blood; a dead infant; a father, covered in cement dust, dead, holding the arm of an infant, also dead, the infant headless.\nMost of these images we cannot show you. The reason is simple: there is no watershed on the internet and you cannot put out these kind of images without causing people, especially children, real upset.\nI understand this completely.\nI returned from Rwanda and Burundi in 1988 from reporting a massacre for the Observer, and back in London described a machete wound to a friend, who wrote TV comedies. His face went green.\nI realised that from then on, I should be careful about what I said about the details of man's inhumanity to man; still more about what I showed via image and video.\nBut then the other thing. Something truly horrible is happening to the people of eastern Aleppo.\nThey rose up against Bashar al-Assad five years ago. They are not with Isis but against them; they seek a third path between the tyrant and the fanatics.\nThey are trapped inside a siege. They have nowhere to hide. So when the cluster bombs fall - the ones that don't go off are marked Shoab 0.5m in Russian, so we have a pretty good idea who is dropping them - they kill.\nOn our BBC Newsnight film we did show something of what happens when a cluster bomb lands on a city packed with children.\nThe doctors in the underground hospital filmed one little boy with a ball bearing from a cluster bomb in his spine; a second with a ball bearing that had entered the back of his head and lodged in the skull just behind his nose.\nWe did show blood on the floor of the hospital - there is no time to get rid of it and, since the waterworks has been bombed, no good water supply. We did show neurosurgery taking place on the floor because no beds were free.\nBut we didn't show what often happens: that cluster bombs kill children. The danger is that, for fear of causing upset, we end up sanitising war.\nThis matters because Western policy on Syria is in deep trouble. Assad's strategic narrative - it's a choice between me or Isis - is becoming more and more true.\nThe danger for Western security is that policy may drive good people into the hands of Isis because they hate Assad so much. But if people in the West do not see the reality on the ground because media organisations don't want to cause upset, then the story gets obscured or buried.\nHollywood hoovers up the dreadful dust of war. In multiplex movies you see machine-guns spit and shells fall -  but not people with no eyes because of the percussion effect from high explosives; you see heroism, but not children with ball bearings in their spine.\nAssad and Russia say they are fighting terrorism. None of the dead children pictured on my phone and indelibly in my memory are terrorists.\nCorrecting these falsehoods - both benign and malign - is the job of journalism. Right now we are not showing you the full horror of the war in Syria.\n [OUT] ",

Natural Capital is our single, greatest ally as we try to defend vulnerable communities from the onslaught of more frequent storms, flood and drought.\"\nDelegates were being invited to sign a letter that called on world leaders attending the Paris summit to recognise that tackling climate change could not be achieved unless the loss of the world's natural capital was halted.\n\"What we are saying is protection of that natural capital is a prerequisite for tackling the climate crisis,\" Jonathan Hughes explained.\n\"The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, which the governments from around the world are taking to Paris, [reveal that] a lot of the emissions are from land-use change and land-use degradation.\n\"So we cannot solve the climate crisis without solving the biodiversity crisis.\"\n [OUT] ",

This is really special.\"\nThe United States have now won five of the last seven competitions and 10 from 15 since the Solheim Cup began in 1990.\n\"The Europeans fought hard today and made it really close,\" said US captain Juli Inkster who joined Judy Rankin as the only women to captain back-to-back winning US Solheim Cup teams.\n\"I really haven't been nervous all week but today I was a little bit. It's an honour to captain this team and I'm really proud of the girls.\"\n\"We just got outplayed, there's no doubt about it,\" said European captain Annika Sorenstam.\nIn the first and best match of the day, world number two Lexi Thompson was four down to Europe's leading player Anna Nordqvist after nine holes.\nThe American rallied superbly with eagles on the 11th and 15th and birdied the 16th to take a one up lead heading into the last.\nBut Nordqvist, who had won all three of her matches over the first two days despite still recovering from a bout of glandular fever, hit an inspired approach shot on the last to halve the match.\n\"That had to be the weirdest round of golf I've ever played,\" 22-year-old Thompson said.\n\"Front nine I don't think I was awake and back nine I played lights out. It was just a crazy round but Anna played great.\"\nNordqvist added: \"I got a little shaky there in the middle watching her make birdies and eagles but she gave me the chance missing that putt on 17,\" said the Swede.\n\"I'm very impressed with her back nine and very proud of myself.\"\nThompson's comeback gave the American team momentum and Kerr wrapped up a 2&1 victory over Mel Reid on the 17th and moments later Creamer won one up against Georgia Hall.\nThat left the hosts needing one more point to triumph but victories from Germany's Caroline Masson, who beat Michelle Wie 3&2, and veteran Scot Catriona Matthew, who trailed all the way until the 15th before beating Stacy Lewis one up, made the scoreboard look more respectable.\nAngel Yin looked like she would complete the hosts' victory but the 18-year-old bogeyed the 17th and halved her match with France's Karine Icher, but with the US ahead in other matches it was enough to confirm they would retain the cup.\nSpain's Carlota Ciganda thrashed Brittany Lincicome 4&3 before Salas held off England's Ewart Shadoff for a one up victory on the 18th.\nEngland's Florentyna Parker lost 4&2 to Gerina Piller but Charley Hull, who missed all of Saturday's play because of a wrist injury, battled to a one up victory over Brittany Lang, and Sweden's Madelene Sagstrom earned a 3&2 win over Austin Ernst.\nThe competition finished with Emily Kristine Pedersen losing 3&1 to Danielle Kang but the European team showed their team spirit by walking arm in arm down the 16th fairway with the Dane.\nSorenstram confirmed afterwards she would not return as Europe's captain for the 2019 tournament at Gleneagles.\n\"I said this was a one-time thing for me,\" she said. \"It is time to move the torch to the next person.\"\nBBC golf correspondent Iain Carter:\nEurope simply had too much to do. The decisive session came on Friday afternoon when the visitors were whitewashed in the fourballs and in the singles Europe produced a spirited display.\nThe half between Anna Nordqvist and Lexi Thompson will be remembered as one of the greatest Solheim singles matches.\nCatriona Matthew completed a remarkable match, gaining three points out of four. The Scot should have been named in the team rather than as a late replacement for the injured Suzann Pettersen.\nThe Norwegian's absence was crucial, as was Charley Hull's departure from the fray throughout Saturday to rest her injured wrist as Europe do not possess the strength in depth to cope with the loss of such talents.\nLexi Thompson Halved Anna Nordqvist\nPaula Creamer wins 1UP Georgia Hall\nCristie Kerr wins 2&1 Mel Reid\nStacy Lewis loses 1UP Catriona Matthew\nAngel Yin Halved Karine Icher\nMichelle Wie loses 4&2 Caroline Masson\nLizette Salas wins 1UP Jodi Ewart Shadoff\nBrittany Lang loses 1UP Charley Hull\nBrittany Lincicome loses 4&3 Carlota Ciganda\nGerina Piller wins 4&2 Florentyna Parker\nAustin Ernst loses Madelene Sagstrom 3&2\nDanielle Kang 3&1 Emily Pedersen\n [OUT] ",

Sierra Leone and Guinea both had much larger outbreaks and it took a little longer. Sierra Leone was declared Ebola-free on 7 November 2015, Guinea followed in December.\nLiberia has been the worst-hit, with more than 4,800 dead and 10,672 becoming infected. The WHO said that at the peak of transmission, during August and September 2014, Liberia was reporting between 300 and 400 new cases every week.\nThe epidemic seemed to abate and the outbreak in Liberia was declared over on 9 May 2015 - only to re-emerge seven weeks later when a 17-year-old man died from the disease and more cases were reported. The same happened in September,  which is why the latest declaration of Liberia being Ebola-free, while welcome, should be treated with caution, say correspondents.\nThe WHO has warned that West Africa may see flare-ups of the virus.\nResearchers from the New England Journal of Medicine traced the outbreak to a two-year-old toddler, who died in December 2013 in Meliandou, a small village in south-eastern Guinea.\nIn March, hospital staff alerted Guinea's Ministry of Health and then medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).  They reported a mysterious disease in the south-eastern regions of Gueckedou, Macenta, Nzerekore, and Kissidougou.\nIt caused fever, diarrhoea and vomiting. It also had a high death rate. Of the first 86 cases, 59 people died.\nThe WHO later confirmed the disease as Ebola.\n\"Biggest health challenge since Aids\"\nHow not to catch Ebola\nWhy is Ebola so dangerous?\nEbola diary\nTracing the outbreak\nFull special report\nThe Gueckedou prefecture in Guinea, where the outbreak started, is a major regional trading centre and, by the end of March, Ebola had crossed the border into Liberia. It was confirmed in Sierra Leone in May.\nIn June, MSF described the Ebola outbreak as out of control.\nNigeria had its first case of the disease in July and, in the same month, two leading doctors died from Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nIn August, the United Nations health agency declared an \"international public health emergency\", saying that a co-ordinated response was essential to halt the spread of the virus.\nSenegal reported its first case of Ebola on 29 August. A young man from Guinea had travelled to Senegal despite having been infected with the virus, officials said.\nBy September, WHO director general Margaret Chan said the number of patients was \"moving far faster than the capacity to manage them\".\nDirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, Thomas Frieden, said in October that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was unlike anything since the emergence of HIV/Aids. But Senegal managed to halt transmissions by mid October.\nAuthorities in Mali confirmed the death of the country's first Ebola patient, a two-year-old girl, on 25 October. The girl had travelled hundreds of kilometres by bus from Guinea through Mali showing symptoms of the disease, the WHO said.\nAn infected Islamic preacher from Guinea, who was initially diagnosed with a kidney problem, was treated at a clinic in Bamako. The preacher died a few days after entering the country.\nTwo health workers who cared for the preacher also died after contracting the virus. In total, Mali recorded six deaths from Ebola.  By January 2015 however, the country was declared ebola-free.\n*In all but three cases the patient was infected with Ebola while in West Africa. Infection outside Africa has been restricted to health workers in Madrid and in Dallas. DR Congo also reported a separate outbreak of an unrelated strain of Ebola.\nThe first case of the deadly virus diagnosed on US soil was announced on 1 October. Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who contracted the virus in Liberia before travelling to the US, died on 8 October.\nHe had not displayed symptoms of the disease until 24 September, five days after his arrival. Other people with whom he came into contact are being monitored for symptoms.\nTwo medical workers in Dallas, Texas, who treated Duncan tested positive for Ebola since his death but have both recovered.  The second death on US soil was  surgeon Martin Salia, from Sierra Leone. He was flown back to the United States in November and treated for Ebola at a hospital in Nebraska. But Dr Salia, who had US residency and was married to an American, died a short time later.\nSpanish nurse Teresa Romero was the first person to contract the virus outside West Africa. She was part of a team of about 30 staff at the Carlos II hospital in Madrid looking after two missionaries who returned from Liberia and Sierra Leone after becoming infected.\nGermany, Norway, France, Italy, Switzerland and the UK have all treated patients who contracted the virus in West Africa.\nEbola was first identified in 1976 and occurs in regions of sub-Saharan Africa. There are normally fewer than 500 cases reported each year, and no cases were reported at all between 1979 and 1994.\nIn August 2014, the WHO confirmed a separate outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. By the beginning of October there had been 70 cases reported and 43 deaths.\nHowever, the outbreak in DR Congo was a different strain of the virus and unrelated to the epidemic in West Africa, which now dwarfs all previous outbreaks.\n [OUT] ",

Football fans reporting rival supporters or friends who've fallen out and want to make a point.\nBut at times, lives are at risk.\n\"We prioritise based on how serious something could potentially be,\" Julie said.\n\"So if we feel that someone is being bullied or there's a risk of real-world harm we are going to prioritise those reports ahead of the rest and they'll be reviewed in a matter of hours.\"\nFacebook has faced criticism in the past for being inconsistent in the way it handles sensitive content.\nControversy over pictures of women breastfeeding and beheading videos are examples of the company's policies proving unpopular.\nBut the social network insists there are hard and fast rules about what users can or can't post.\n\"There is a line and there is content that we won't allow, we have a whole set of rules that are available on our site,\" said Julie.\nJess Lathan, 26, is one of many people who posted a comment on the Newsbeat Facebook page expressing frustration at how the reporting process works.\n\"I've tried to report several different indecent images on Facebook, really graphic or pornographic images.\n\"I'm not sure how bad it has to get before something violates Facebook's terms and is actually removed,\" she said.\nFacebook Content Policy Manager Ciara Lyden described the process of responding to rules as \"a balancing act\".\n\"It comes from the starting point of how do you keep people safe, but Facebook is also a place for sharing and we want to connect the world and allow people to be open.\"\nBut the company admits it doesn't always get it right.\n\"Because we have teams of people, sometimes we make mistakes.\n\"We're human and we're very sorry when we do make a mistake,\" said Julie de Balliencourt.\nFacebook won't say exactly how many people work in their Community Operations team.\nNewsbeat understands some of its work is outsourced to companies in various countries around the world.\nWhile Facebook promises that every report is looked at by a human being, automated systems are also used.\n\"We have things in place relating to spam,\" Julie explains.\n\"Facebook is highly attractive to spammers and phishers. We have automation in place to flag fake accounts and remove them.\"\nHowever, decisions to remove content reported for being violent, explicit or offensive are open to interpretation.\n\"Where it can become tricky, you need to take into account who is making the report, maybe the relationship they have with the person they are reporting.\n\"The language they speak, the country they come from - maybe if it's a photo that is posted on a page we will want to look at the whole page not just the photo in isolation.\"\nA common complaint from users is a lack of feedback on why content is or isn't removed.\nFacebook admits there is room for improvement, promising changes to the reporting system.\n\"In the next few months we want to be more explicit and explain in much more detail why something was ignored or why something was actioned,\" Julie said.\nBut still, users should expect to be challenged by some of the content they see, suggests Julie.\n\"The same thing will apply if you choose to watch the news, you're going to see different types of content that are thought provoking.\n\"Those are real things happening in today's world that would maybe raise really good questions.\n\"The fact is that you see great things and sometimes you see things that shouldn't be there.\"\nWith 1.3 billion users, Facebook will never keep everyone happy.\nIt is clearly trying to strike a balance, but as the number of users continues to grow, that challenge may only become harder.\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] A state television announcement said the missile, which landed in the Sea of Japan on Tuesday, could hit targets anywhere in the world.\nBut the US and Russia said the missile had a medium range and presented no threat to either country.\nNorth Korea has increased the frequency of its missile tests, in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council.\nChina and Russia  called on Pyongyang to freeze its missile and nuclear activities.\nThe announcement on North Korea state television said the Hwasong-14 missile test was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un.\nIt said the projectile had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea.\nNorth Korea, it said, was now \"a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world\".\nIt would enable the country to \"put an end to the US nuclear war threat and blackmail\" and defend the Korean peninsula, it said.\nWhile Pyongyang appears to have made progress, experts believe North Korea does not have the capability to accurately hit a target with an ICBM, or miniaturise a nuclear warhead that can fit onto such a missile.\nOther nuclear powers have also cast doubt on North Korea's assessment, with Russia saying the missile only reached an altitude of 535km and flew about 510km.\nThe big question is what range it has, says the BBC's Steven Evans in Seoul. Could it hit the United States?\nDavid Wright, a physicist with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, says that if the reports are correct, this missile could \"reach a maximum range of roughly 6,700km on a standard trajectory\".\nThat range would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the large islands of Hawaii or the other 48 US states, he says.\nIt is not just a missile that North Korea would need, our correspondent adds. It must also have the ability to protect a warhead as it re-enters the atmosphere, and it is not clear if North Korea can do that.\nOnce again North Korea has defied the odds and thumbed its nose at the world in a single missile launch. With the test of the Hwasong-14, it has shown that it can likely reach intercontinental ballistic missile ranges including putting Alaska at risk.\nKim Jong-un has long expressed his desire for such a test, and to have it on the 4 July holiday in the US is just the icing on his very large cake.\nDespite this technical achievement, however, it is likely many outside North Korea will continue to be sceptical of North Korea's missile. They will ask for proof of working guidance, re-entry vehicle, and even a nuclear warhead.\nFrom a technical perspective, though, their engines have demonstrated ICBM ranges, and this would be the first of several paths North Korea has to an ICBM with even greater range.\nNorth Korea's missile programme\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in has called on the UN Security Council to take steps against North Korea.\nJapan described \"repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable\" and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would \"unite strongly\" with the US and South Korea to put pressure on Pyongyang.\nRussia and China said the launch was \"unacceptable\".\nChinese President Xi Jinping is in Moscow, where he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe two leaders urged Pyongyang to suspend all its tests. They also asked the US and South Korea to not hold joint military exercises.\nUS President Donald Trump also responded swiftly on Tuesday.\nOn his Twitter account he made apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying: \"Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?\"\n\"Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!\"\nPresident Trump has repeatedly called on China, Pyongyang's closest economic ally, to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programmes.\nOn the prospect of North Korea being able to strike the US, he tweeted in January: \"It won't happen\". However experts say it might - within five years or less.\nBeijing called for \"restraint\" following the latest test on Tuesday.\nForeign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was opposed to North Korea going against clear UN Security Council resolutions on its missile launches.\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK \"stood alongside the US and our allies to confront the threat North Korea poses to international security\".\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n [OUT] ",

Many are learning to knit for the first time, just to take part.\nThe project has caught the imagination of people all over the world - but \"craftivism\" isn't a new idea.\nIn Canada, there's the Revolutionary Knitting Circle, which first made headlines for their protest at the 2002 G8 summit. Australia has the Knitting Nannas, who protest about environmental issues by holding \"knit-ins\".\nIn the UK, activists from Wool Against Weapons knitted a seven-mile-long pink \"peace scarf\" to protest against the country's Trident nuclear weapon programme. Then, a year later, they repurposed it into thousands of blankets for those in need in warzones and developing nations.\nBut down in Chile, it's the hombres tejedores (knitting men) who break down stereotypes and teach other men to embrace the creative hobby.\nAnd in cities across the world, \"yarn bombing\" reclaims urban spaces with a pair of needles, covering everyday items in brightly coloured knits. Like other forms of graffiti, yarn bombing can convey a message of protest - or it can just be street art for the sake of art.\nKnitting for change is a global activity.\nAs far back as the 1960s in Britain, when anti-nuclear protesters - mainly women - set up a peace camp at Greenham Common, they turned an air force fence into a work of art with their knitting and material crafts.\nIn fact, knitting's association with political dissent goes back hundreds of years - to the grim days of the the French revolution.\nWomen known as les tricoteuses (knitting women) famously sat by the guillotine in Paris during the \"reign of terror\" - and were later immortalised by Charles Dickens in the sinister character of Madame Defarge in A Tale of Two Cities.\nThey would watch the executions calmly - knitting the symbolic red \"liberty cap\" between deaths, according to some stories. Those bonnets rouges are a symbol still worn by the figure of Marianne, the embodiment of France.\nThe United States adopted that patriotic-yet-productive spirit during its own revolution, when women knitted clothing for soldiers during the war of independence - a wartime tradition that continued into the twentieth century.\nBut craftivism has come a long way, and is more likely to be hot pink than blood red.\nToday, Instagram and Twitter are awash with tens of thousands of #pussyhatproject posts.\nPunk icon Patti Smith, comedian Amy Schumer, and actress Krysten Ritter have all been seen wearing the recognisable shape, and the hosts of US television programme The View closed Wednesday's show wearing them.\nThe response, one workshop organiser says, has been overwhelming.\nDiana Kane, a feminist and boutique owner in New York, started making and selling the hats for those who don't knit themselves - with the proceeds going towards a pro-choice political fund.\n\"We hit capacity a week ago - all volunteer labour,\" she said. \"I've been turning people away for days.\"\n\"I think women have been able to channel their frustration and anger into something communal, creative and productive. It feels good.\n\"And it's given women who otherwise won't be able to participate in the marches a way to contribute and voice their anger.\"\nIt's not yet clear just how many people will attend the Women's March on Washington - perhaps as many as 200,000. The Washington DC metro is opening early and putting extra trains on to cope with demand, and hundreds of buses have registered to park in the city.\nIt will certainly be a large demonstration - but at least there'll be a warm hat for every marcher, and a country's supply of pink wool on show.\n [OUT] ",

Sitting in the local Green councillor's kitchen he told me that \"during the election we had dozens of people here leafleting, canvassing, it was a bit of an HQ.\" He said \"we'd had so many new members as well, people coming through with no experience in politics, polling, mucking in, it was fantastic\".\nSince the general election 7,000 people have joined the Green Party but more than 3,000 have left.  Peter Kellner, the president of the polling organisation YouGov told me many are heading to Labour.\n\"There is no doubt that Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is siphoning votes off from the Greens,\" he said. \"Quite a lot of Green members joined the Labour party to vote for him. I think the Greens have a real challenge - one of the reasons for the challenge is that they face a very hostile voting system.\"\nHe added: \"They have one MP. They had what, one million plus votes at the general election. Had we had a proportional voting system they'd have had what, 20 MPsÃ¢â¬Â¦ The Greens are not a big party and if so many of their active supporters decided to sign up for Labour that's a real problem for the Greens.\"\nMartha Everett from Buxton in Derbyshire was a Labour voter but joined the Greens before the election. Now that Jeremy Corbyn has been elected leader she has switched back to Labour. She paid ÃÂ£3 and signed up as an affiliated supporter to vote for Mr Corbyn and intends to vote Labour at the next general election.\n\"It purely comes down to thinking that my vote will actually make a difference rather than just being a protest vote\" she told me, adding that \"the policies don't seem to be widely different although obviously Labour have a bit more experience of actually being in power as well so in that respect more likely to get things done I would have thought.\"\nBut Caroline Lucas dismissed concern that Mr Corbyn's Labour could start siphoning off votes from the Greens and that the so-called Green surge could turn out to be temporary.\n\"I think the core of that is significant and will stay,\" she told me.\n\"Yes some people are leaving,\" she admitted, \"but others are joining and we're still seeing net increase in the number of our members.\"\nShe continued: \"There is just a general churn in politics. In the old days people would join a party and stay with it for life. They'd often join it because their parents were members of it beforehand. I think now people are much more flexible, fluid.\n\"Politics is very different, it's moving much faster. It wouldn't surprise me if those people who have left come back again. The Greens are doing something distinctive and I hope people will stay with us because they recognise that.\"\nBack on the streets of Islington the Greens are keeping up the fight.\nThe local Green councillor, Sarah Russell, is optimistic. She stood against Jeremy Corbyn in the general election and told me she managed to increase the Green share of the vote three-fold: \"It shows even up against Jeremy Corbyn himself the Green vote can hold strong.

To be able to play and not have games postponed would be a huge bonus too.\"\nCardiff Blues are currently the only Pro 12 side with a synthetic pitch, which they installed ahead of the 2013-14 season, following the lead set by English Premiership champions Saracens at their Allianz Park home.\n\"In the matches we have played at the Blues, I have enjoyed playing on a surface that you know is going to be consistent every time you play on it,\" said Glasgow wing Lee Jones. \"I think it could really benefit the team.\"\nGlasgow managing director Nathan Bombrys said they are \"very close to a breakthrough\" over a new pitch.\n\"It is important to note that Scotstoun is a multi-sport facility and it also hosts athletics events,\" he told BBC Scotland.\n\"It is owned by Glasgow City Council and it's done pretty well for us. We are a tenant but have been able to make Scotstoun feel like home, but it has a weakness.\n\"When we get wet weather, the pitch does struggle and our expectations and requirements have grown.\"\nBombry said negotiations are continuing with Glasgow Life, the agency that runs the facility for the council, about an artificial surface.\n\"The way forward for us would be to get a 3G pitch in there,\" he said.\n\"It would give us a good surface to play on and to train on and would open up opportunities for the community and for athletics to use it as well.\n\"Where it falls short is that it is not conducive to throwing javelins and hammers on it. We are looking for solutions with Glasgow Life.\"\nBombry explained that, although there would be financial implications, the decision was taken early to switch the 23 January game to Kilmarnock to allow supporters plenty of time to make arrangements.\n\"Scotstoun has been flooded a number of times with the heavy rain,\" he said.\n\"The rains have been phenomenal. It does drain away, but it leaves a very unstable surface and then we get more rain and it is under water again.\n\"We have had multiple different expert groundsmen look at it for us and, by not playing or training on it for a while, we hope it will recover.\n\"We are not going to have a game of rugby there in a week's time and we thought we had a good facility available at Rugby Park.\"\nBombry pointed out that, should Glasgow win at Northampton on Sunday, the final pool match against Racing could give his side a chance to reach the quarter-finals.\n\"We were already heading for a sell-out and we can accommodate a few more people at Rugby Park,\" he added.  \"It should be a good arena for a big game in European rugby.\"\n [OUT] ",

Tate Modern opened free from May 2000 and the Imperial War Museum North from July 2002.\nGovernment figures show visits to museums that had previously charged for entry in London increased by 151% between 2000-01 and 2010-11. The total visitor numbers to DCMS-sponsored museums for 2010-11 was 43.8m.\nIn that 10-year period, visits to the National Maritime Museum were up 200% - from 800,000 to 2.4m; visits to the Natural History Museum rose by nearly 190% - from 1.6m to nearly 4.7m and visits to the Victoria & Albert Museum rose by about 180% from close to 1m to 2.6m.\nMuseums that still charge an entrance fee include Tate St Ives, the Imperial War Museum's HMS Belfast, the Cabinet War Rooms and the Imperial War Museum Duxford.\nFull list of DCMS-sponsored museums\nThe DCMS says free admission attracts huge numbers of international visitors. In comparison, it says, museum charges apply at the Museum of Modern Art in New York ($25; Â£21), the Louvre in Paris (â¬10; Â£8.50) and the Vatican Museum in Rome (â¬15; Â£12).\nAccording to tourism body Visit Britain, Britain's major museums and galleries earn the country Â£1bn a year in revenue from overseas tourists.\nMr Hunt said: \"Our free museums and galleries ensure that culture is for everyone, not just the lucky few.\n\"I am particularly proud that we have secured the future of free museums despite the current financial climate.\"\nLord Smith said he had been determined to change the rising tide of charging for entry to museums.\n\"I had always felt that it was important to open up these storehouses of our nation's culture and history and art and science and knowledge to the widest possible range of people, and charging, in some cases quite steep admission charges, was a barrier facing very large numbers of people who might otherwise want to come,\" he said.\n\"Removing that barrier was, I thought, a really important thing to do and it has proved to be very successful.\"\nMichael Fayle, chairman of the British Association of Friends of Museums, an independent organisation that represents friends and volunteers across the UK, said the figures showed there was \"true benefit\" to the public in having free museums.\nBut he said museums often had to foot the bill for extra visitors. For example, longer opening hours mean there is a need for extra staff.\nMany museums have cafes, while others ask for a minimum donation to support the attraction.\nMr Fayle believes this is justified.\n\"One of the comments I heard this morning was that if you make the wider availability as free as you can at a time when central government funding isn't available, there simply has to be an alternative way of making money,\" he said.\nHowever, he said charging for \"blockbuster\" exhibitions was a \"difficult equation\".\nSuch exhibitions bring in large numbers of visitors but the high cost of running them - and the need to recoup that money through entrance fees - means some people miss out, said Mr Fayle. He added that many visitors might find the experience diminished because of overcrowding.\n\"One wonders whether [holding paid-for exhibitions] is in the spirit of the free access that everyone wants to achieve,\" he said.\nContinued access to free museums is part of the coalition government's agreement and funding to secure this was put in place in last year's Spending Review.\nNational museums in Scotland and Wales have been free to enter since 2001. In Northern Ireland, one of its three national museums - the Ulster Museum in Belfast - is free while the other two charge a fee.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Government plans to remove the right of senior doctors to opt out of weekend working have provoked an angry response.\nIn a sign of the sensitivity of the issue, there have been differences of opinion over the status of the talks.\nThe Department of Health argued it was \"encouraging\" that both sides were sitting down for discussions.  The BMA response was that these talks, which also cover junior doctors' contracts, are \"exploratory\" and it should not be presumed that they will definitely pave the way for substantive negotiations.\nThe Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called in mid-July for the BMA to decide quickly whether to enter negotiations over seven-day working for consultants in non-emergency care.\nIf there was no decision within six weeks, he said, he would impose a new contract for newly qualified consultants.  The Whitehall interpretation of when those six weeks expire is mid-September, allowing for holidays.\nIt is understood that BMA consultants' representatives will review early next month whether there is scope, in their view, for formal negotiations to take place.\nMr Hunt's argument is that the public should be entitled to an NHS which provides a genuinely seven-day service.\nHe says patients can be needlessly detained in hospital over a weekend because consultants are not available till Monday to analyse test results and authorise discharges.\nHe has repeatedly pointed to higher death rates for weekend admissions - 16% higher on a Sunday and 11% higher on a Saturday compared to admissions on a Wednesday.\nSome have argued, though, that this has more to do with people arriving at hospital more seriously ill at weekends than during the week, rather than anything to do with staffing.\nQuestions have been asked about the Government's suggestion that 6,000 excess deaths per year are caused by what's described as the \"Monday to Friday culture\" in the NHS.\nOfficials said that this figure had been extracted from research which is due to be published soon.\nSir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, has for some while been trying to encourage hospitals to move towards a more extensive weekend service.\nHe and his officials have been working on an authoritative analysis of higher death rates for patients admitted at weekends.\nThey say it is an issue facing international healthcare systems as well as the NHS and want to develop a consensus on tackling the problem and changing working practices.\nConsultants, both through their union the BMA and personally on social media, have voiced their anger at what they see as a provocative move by Mr Hunt.\nA  Twitter campaign branded #ImInWorkJeremy was launched by doctors working over the weekend after the Secretary of State's announcement.\nThey are aggrieved at suggestions they only work Monday to Friday.   Many consultants already work or are on call on some weekends.\nWhat's not clear is how many consultants exercise their right not to work at weekends and how much senior doctor weekend cover there is at different hospitals.\nSome trusts have already introduced contracts obliging consultants to work on Saturdays and Sundays if required.  Others pay a locally negotiated premium for weekend work.\nThe government says these local deals are sometimes too costly and there should be a single nationally negotiated weekend rate.\nWhile battle lines have formed, Mr Hunt himself has become the focus of much of the doctors' criticism.\nAn online petition has called for a parliamentary debate and vote of no confidence in the health secretary - it has gathered more than 212,000 signatures, well above other such petitions since the election but not yet at the level of a couple organised during the last parliament such as a demand to stop the badger cull.\nAny petition with more than 100,000 signatures has to be considered for a debate by a parliamentary committee.  The government response is to re-state its commitment to making NHS care at weekends as safe as during the week through the delivery of seven-day services.\nThe debate will simmer on during the sluggish August weeks ahead.  It may come to the boil next month as MP's return from their holidays and consultants' leaders deliver their verdict on talks over the government's plans.\n [OUT] ",

It is one of the longest-running small mammal monitoring projects in the world.\nThe creatures live mainly in hedgerows and woods, weaving ball-like nests in the undergrowth from bark in the summer and hibernating on or near the ground in winter between October and May.\nThey are extremely tricky to locate - a populated area the size of two football fields will only contain four dormice. A giveaway sign is a nibbled hazelnut.\nToday's report shows that they are more difficult to find than ever. Over the last 16 years, the population has declined by almost 40%. Populations are now restricted to the Welsh borders and southern England. They have never been recorded in Scotland or Northern Ireland.\nIan White is dormouse officer at the People's Trust for Endangered Species. He has been monitoring the species for the last decade and describes the decline as \"dramatic\". He says: \"Dormice have been around for 40 million years, but their future in Britain is now precarious and there's a pressing need for action to ensure their long-term survival.\"\nIn 1885, dormice were present in 49 English counties; today, they're known in 32 - excluding those counties where they have been reintroduced.\nMr White said the evidence pointed towards a few key factors in their decline. They are a woodland animal and there has been a loss of woodland and hedgerows. Their habitats are more fragmented and they can't disperse through the landscape.\nThe management of farmland and woodland has also changed making it harder for them to survive. They are also vulnerable to changes in the weather, in particular wetter springs and summers, when foraging for food becomes harder. Warmer winters also interrupt successful hibernation.\nMr White said: \"This is a sad tale, the raw data is a bit doom and gloom but my personal experience is that there is a lot more interest in what we can do about this and a lot of enthusiasm from the public to help.\"\nThere have been efforts to bring hazel dormice back to the wild. More than 850 animals have been reintroduced at 26 sites. The latest was at Aysgarth in Wensleydale in June. At five of these release sites the population has died. The others have shown signs of success, such as breeding or dispersal to new areas beyond the site.\nPTES monitors 400 sites regularly along with building a national dataset from the information that the public sends in. They also help to train woodland managers and landowners.\nFollow Claire on Twitter\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The club who were once so penniless they required a bucket collection to survive now find themselves mixing it in the billionaires' playground of English football's top flight.\nJust seven years ago they were five minutes from liquidation, a year later they were a game away from going out of the Football League. Now, after a 3-0 win against Bolton which means only a loss, a Middlesbrough win and a 20-goal swing on the final day can deny them, they are celebrating a different piece of club history - playing in the Premier League for the first time.\nBournemouth's place in the elite of English football is a far cry from the financial problems the club has experienced over the past two decades.\nIn January 1997, the club were so penniless a bucket collection was arranged at the Winter Gardens in Bournemouth town centre. Players attended, money was raised and under the guidance of former chairman Trevor Watkins, Europe's first community club was formed as they came out of administration.\n\"I don't think many of us Bournemouth fans could have dreamt this was a possibility,\" Watkins told BBC Sport.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"We were down on our knees and collecting money in buckets. Current manager Eddie Howe was a player when the fans led the rescue. Our assistant manager Jason Tindall was one of the first signings the supporters' trust made at the end of the first season. Steve Fletcher was a player and they are all still together with that passion, spirit and togetherness.\"\nThat rescue act did not signal the end of the club's financial troubles, though. Problems continued and in 2008 the Cherries were placed in administration for the second time in just over 10 years.\nGerald Krasner of Begbies Traynor was appointed as the man tasked with saving the south coast club - who had debts of around Â£4m at the time. Krasner recalls one particular occasion when he came within five minutes of closing them down.\n\"There was one press conference at 12 o'clock when, at five to 12, I didn't know if I had the money to continue trading,\" Krasner told BBC Sport. \"I came within five minutes of liquidating the club.\n\"It was only through the good grace of its current chairman Jeff Mostyn, who came up with the money for the next month, that the club came through that ordeal and successfully out of administration.\"\nKrasner revealed Mostyn paid out sums running into \"hundreds of thousands\" and never imagined they would be in the Premier League during those dark days.\n\"I can't honestly say I ever envisaged a time when Bournemouth would be in the Premier League in such a short time,\" he added. \"When I see them on Match of the Day next season I'll just have a big smile on my face.\"\nWhile the club survived administration they did not survive relegation and began the 2008-09 League Two season with a 17-point deduction and a transfer embargo.\nThings looked grim for the Cherries and when Jimmy Quinn was sacked on 31 December, the club appointed Howe as manager. He led them to a remarkable escape, with Fletcher's goal 10 minutes from time against Grimsby in their last home game of the season confirming survival.\n\"I vaguely remember the commentary 'It's Fletcherâ¦Legend!' as he smashed home a loose ball in the box,\" recalls BBC Radio Solent commentator Laurence Herdman.\n\"The big man ripped off his shirt during the goal celebration in front of the main stand revealing a muscular physique and rippling bodybuilder biceps. The goal kept AFC Bournemouth in the Football League and the Great Escape was complete.\"\nAll those struggles will now seem a world away as they prepare for life in the most popular - and most financially rewarding - league in world football.\n\"The reach of the Premier League is extraordinary,\" said Trevor Birch of business advisory firm BDO.\n\"It's now in over 200 countries and it reaches four billion people, so Bournemouth are going to be catapulted into the world's view.\"\nHowe, 37, has only been a manager for six years but has already achieved enough to be named as the first Football League manager of the decade.\nHe first arrived at the club as a shy 13-year-old defender and went on to break into the first team, establishing himself as a key player. Injury forced his early retirement from the game in 2007 but the lessons he learned as a player from various coaches were soon put into practice as a manager.\nHe was just 31 when he first took charge of the Cherries in January 2009, becoming the youngest boss in the Football League in the process.\nMeticulous in his preparation, Bournemouth's style as they have gone through the leagues has never altered, with Howe sticking to his philosophy of free-flowing, passing football.\nIn two spells he has guided them to Football League safety, promotion into League One the following season and - after a brief spell as manager of Burnley - a rise from the foot of League One to promotions to the Championship and, now, the Premier League.\nHarry Redknapp has always been considered Bournemouth's greatest manager - but even Redknapp accepts his status has gone.\n\"I had 10 years at Bournemouth and I was the most successful manager in their 100-year history. Eddie Howe has come along and blown me out of the water. He is fantastic - I love watching them play.\n\"If I wasn't involved next year, I'd buy a couple of season tickets and watch them every week.\"\nSo little is known of Bournemouth's mystery Russian millionaire owner, Maxim Demin, he could wander through the town centre and not be recognised.\nHe was introduced to the club by former chairman and owner Eddie Mitchell, who had been building Demin's house in Sandbanks. As time passed his influence grew, he became co-owner in 2011 and bought out Mitchell in 2013.\nDemin is based in Switzerland and is said to have been too superstitious to attend games during their run-in this season. He has made his money in petrochemicals and transformed the club both on and off the pitch. He is yet to give an official interview but Krasner is in no doubt how big his influence has been.\n\"He's made the difference between Bournemouth being just another Championship club fighting for survival and now having Premier League status,\" he said. \"The manager and the owner seem to work very well. If the owners and manager work well together you've got a much better chance of success.\"\nThe Cherries began the campaign with a 4-0 victory at Huddersfield, which sent them to the top of the Championship. It set the tone for the rest of the season.\nSix weeks of indifferent form followed before a 2-1 victory over Bolton sparked a six-game winning run that sent them back to the summit. From 4 November onwards, the club did not drop out of the top six as they held off the challenge of former Premier League clubs Middlesbrough and Norwich.\nTheir 8-0 win over Birmingham in October was the first time they had scored eight in a league game, barring a 10-0 win in 1939 which was expunged after World War Two broke out the next day.\nMore club records would tumble: most league goals in a campaign, most away league wins, most away league goals, highest points total, best league finish and the ultimate record: first time in the Premier League.\nAll this was achieved on a relatively small budget, with the arrival of Callum Wilson for around Â£3m their big summer outlay. The majority of the squad were the players that helped achieve promotion from League One.\n\"This is the best Bournemouth side I have seen going back to 1986,\" former Cherries defender John Williams told BBC Sport. \"I speak to fans of 50 and 60 years and they say they have never seen such dynamic football.\"\nThe Cherries recorded an annual turnover of Â£5.1m in their last official financial results. The figure is about to be dwarfed by the riches awaiting them in the Premier League.\nThe club lost Â£15.3m in the financial year ending July 2013 and in total, their net debt is just over Â£15.5m. They only just passed Financial Fair Play regulations earlier this season.\n\"A prudent estimate for a newly-promoted club is upwards of Â£120m,\" Sheffield Hallam University football finance expert Rob Wilson told BBC Sport.\n\"We are looking at a figure of anywhere between Â£100-Â£120m in terms of the value of promotion and the lion's share of that will come from television broadcasting. Depending on how well the club can leverage commercial and sponsorship opportunities you are talking about another Â£20m.\"\nMaking the most of such opportunities might be a challenge for the Cherries, particularly since no club has ever been in the Premier League with a smaller stadium.\nAnd if they are to survive in the top flight, Howe may want to break the club's transfer record. That was set last summer when Wilson, who has gone on to score 23 times this season, joined from Coventry.\nA busy summer awaits on the south coast.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] George Osborne is not just standing up to make a few tweaks to public spending here and there, not just to make a political statement, but to set out the size and shape of the state for the next five years, in a time when money is tight and he has little room for manoeuvre.\nThe government wants to show the country it has a clear mission, and a determination to balance the books in an effective and coherent way.\nThat means making choices and deciding priorities.\nMinisters in the majority Conservative government believe their ability to set priorities ought to be both a strength and an opportunity.\nThis won't be a Spending Review, they say, that displays an attitude of cutting a little bit here and there, moving money around the balance sheet to try to smooth out the pain.\nInstead they see it as a programme of strategic cuts that, while difficult, add up to something: a country where work is rewarded, where anyone who wants to get on is helped to do so, and where the state has a careful approach to spending taxpayers' money, using it judiciously where it helps and not being afraid to scrape it back where it does not.\nBut choosing priorities - not just protecting but substantially increasing spending on areas like health, significant new spending on house building including billions going directly to house builders to encourage them to get spades into the ground, and retaining what many see as generous welfare payments to the older generations - inevitably means others will lose out.\nNo minister would argue that doesn't cause political pain.\nThis spending review will mean, for example, some police officers disappearing from forces around the country, some families taking hits to their incomes through changes to welfare, or some grants to business being cut back.\nEach cut will be analysed in public, just as it has in recent weeks been argued over in private.\nAnd with each saving comes a political risk.\nAs the chancellor knows from bitter experience, the details in statements like these can blow up unpredictably into political problems.\nRebels to the government's planned cuts to tax credits are hopeful of pretty substantial changes. Speculation in Westminster suggests pulling back cuts of more than Â£1,000 a year to some families' incomes to Â£300 or Â£400.\nThe actual details are being kept tightly under wraps.\nBut be in no doubt, the decisions the chancellor has made in recent weeks will be felt around the country.\nHe faces an economic test of trying to stick to his own rules on spending - not just getting the books back into balance but into surplus by the end of the Parliament.\nIt is a political test too.\nMinisters have consistently expressed their desire to make the Conservatives the party of the centre ground, standing up for the so-called \"strivers\", making their party the natural home for the mythical swing voters of Middle England.\nBut the pressure is on to make a programme of cuts meet that goal.\nThe Spending Review is a hefty challenge for the new Opposition too.\nLabour has an opportunity to show they are capable not just of agreeing positions among themselves in order to make an articulate case, but also that they are up to the job of providing proper scrutiny of the government's biggest decisions.\nAfter a very shaky few weeks for Jeremy Corbyn's Labour, it is not certain they'll be able to do that.\nLabour, the SNP and the Lib Dems face a government fresh from an election victory that believes - especially on the economy - that it has a mandate to act.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The 74-year-old, born near Huddersfield, survived a revolt by independent investors after receiving the support of billionaire owner Mike Ashley who said he had his \"full backing\".\nAshley has previously spoken of his belief that Hellawell is the right man to run Sports Direct with him, saying: \"He knows my strengths, he knows my weaknesses.\"\nYet independent investors had been urged to vote against Hellawell's re-election because of a \"catalogue of governance and operational failures\" under his watch.\nMany of these were acknowledged in a September 2016 report commissioned by the firm, following MPs saying that its treatment of staff was closer to \"that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern, reputable High Street retailer\".\nHellawell has faced pressure in other high-profile roles as the government's \"drugs czar\" and the chief constable of West Yorkshire Police.\nHe started a 36-year career in the police at the age of 20 after beginning his working life as a coal miner once he left school at the age of 15.\nHe became Britain's youngest sergeant aged 23 and progressed through the ranks to become assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire in 1983.\nWhile in that role, he was criticised for his tough treatment of fellow officers. He shut police station bars and sacked some deskbound senior officers so he could appoint more to go on the beat instead.\nHe moved up to chief constable in 1993 after a spell in a similar role in Cleveland, where he won praise for the way he dealt with allegations of sexual abuse in the area as families were separated after controversial tests.\nIn between, he served in most departments and was awarded the Queen's Police Medal for Distinguished Service in 1990.\nAfter the arrest of the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, in the 1980s, Hellawell was moved on to the case and managed to extract more confessions of attempted murder from him.\nHowever, he also attracted criticism after spontaneously giving Sutcliffe a Christmas card, although he told the Sunday Times in 2000: \"It was just part of the rapport thing to get him to open up.\"\nDuring the 1960s, he launched one of the first dedicated drugs squads, while during his police career he also found time to study for a degree in social policy and take another one in law.\nIn 1998, he was appointed as Tony Blair's government's new UK anti-drugs co-ordinator - also known as \"drugs czar\" - with a remit of dealing with the problems of drug use and reducing the amount coming into the UK.\nEven that move was criticised because during his time in West Yorkshire he had operated a policy of widespread cautioning of cannabis-takers instead of automatically prosecuting them.\nTwo years into the job he called for police to stop pursuing cannabis users so rigorously in an attempt to focus on drugs which cause \"the major harm\", such as heroin and cocaine.\nHowever, he told the BBC he did not support \"legalisation nor decriminalisation\" of cannabis.\nIn 2001, his role was changed to make him a part-time adviser on international drug issues after the new Home Secretary, David Blunkett, took over his responsibilities.\nHe won praise for his work in the role from Mr Blunkett, who said: \"Keith has done an excellent job in helping lay the foundations for the future.\"\nA year later and Hellawell was gone - announcing his resignation on BBC Radio 4's Today programme over Mr Blunkett's decision to downgrade cannabis from a Class B to a Class C drug.\nIn May 2006, he became chairman of pharmaceuticals business Goldshield, which had been one of five companies charged by the Serious Fraud Office with conspiracy to defraud a month earlier. However, the case collapsed in late 2008.\nThe following year, Hellawell became chairman of Sports Direct - replacing David Richardson who had quit the role two years earlier.\nAlthough the company's shares soared in recent years, 2016 saw a downturn with the firm dropping out of the FTSE 100 in March.\nThe company was also accused of exploiting its workers, many of whom are employed on zero-hours contracts, although Sports Direct has now pledged to abolish these terms for its directly employed, casual retail staff.\nAnd at a parliamentary inquiry in 2015, Hellawell faced a barrage of criticism from MPs over his lack of knowledge about the collapse of one of Sports Direct's subsidiaries.\n [OUT] ",

They don't want to be just football fans, but be something more.\n\"When football fans have been seen as political groups they have usually been associated with being right wing, particularly in Italy.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Universities UK head Professor Steve Smith wrote to vice-chancellors saying this week's Browne Review set out figures that \"confirm our worst fears\".\nHe says they signal a Â£3.2bn or 79% cut from teaching and Â£1bn from research in next week's Spending Review.\nThe government said it could not comment.\nThis is because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it could not speculate about the Chancellor's spending review plans.\nCurrently universities are given around Â£11bn in government grants a year - this covers undergraduate and post-graduate teaching, research funding and infrastructure.\nThe UCU lecturers' union said cuts of the order being discussed would lead to university closures while the National Union of Students warned the government was stripping away the public funding of universities.\nIn his letter to fellow vice-chancellors, the UUK president suggests the impact of the Spending Review will be more important than Lord Browne's review of fees published this week.\nThis is \"because potential cuts have been getting worse and worse\", he says.\nHe continues: \"Browne explicitly says that Hefce (England's university funding body) will have teaching funding of Â£700m; the current sum is Â£3.9bn.\n\"This implies a cut of around Â£3.2bn in state funding.\"\nThis would represent a 79% cut in the teaching grant.\nHe adds: \"Browne's figures confirm our worst fears. Cuts in the order of Â£1bn for research also appear to be proposed.\"\nA Â£4.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government.\nProfessor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\".\nAnd he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says.\nBut he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees.\nHe adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\"\nResponding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making Â£4.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth.\n\"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\"\nShe called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\".\nPresident of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission.\n\"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\"\nHe accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down.\nA spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation\nHe added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay.\n\"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.  Ensuring the university sector is properly funded remains a key objective for the government.\"\nBut Shadow Business Secretary John Denham said the coalition was clearly planning unprecedented cuts in higher education.\n\"It will mean pushing all or most of the cost of the university education onto students.\n\"For Britain in a global economy it will damage one of the main drivers of growth, jobs and prosperity,\" he added.\n [OUT] ",

Just as each and every one of us found something unique in David's music, we welcome everyone's celebration of his life as they see fit.\"\nBowie had released a new album, Blackstar, just two days before his death,  which has been retrospectively interpreted as his epitaph.\nAlthough the record features lyrics such as \"Look up here, I'm in heaven,\" its producer Tony Visconti said the star had written and demo-ed five new songs in recent weeks.\nSpeaking to Rolling Stone magazine, Visconti said Bowie had called him about a week before his death and \"at that late stage, he was planning the follow-up to Blackstar\".\n\"I was thrilled,\" said the producer, who worked on key Bowie albums including The Man Who Sold the World, Low and 2013's surprise comeback The Next Day.\n\"I thought, and he thought, that he'd have a few months, at least. So the end must've been very rapid. I'm not privy to it. I don't know exactly, but he must've taken ill very quickly after that phone call.\"\nVisconti will be one of the musicians performing at a memorial concert for Bowie at New York's Carnegie Hall in March.\nThe Music of David Bowie had originally been billed as a tribute show, with artists including Cyndi Lauper and The Roots also performing, but the event will now give fans the opportunity to mourn.\nTributes will also be paid at next month's Brit Awards, with a performance celebrating the \"extraordinary life and work of one of our greatest icons\".\nMeanwhile, Blackstar is set to become Bowie's first number one album in the US, as sales surged after news of his death broke on Monday.\nThe critically acclaimed record is also headed to number one in the UK, while 13 of his previous albums are expected to enter the top 100.\nWatch a special tribute programme David Bowie: Sound and Vision on the BBC iPlayer\n [OUT] ",

They have now been told to move to new housing elsewhere.\nPolice spokesman Supt Micky Rosenfeld said a local man had driven at speed towards officers deployed during an operation to demolish 15 structures deemed to have been built without a permit on state land.\n\"A vehicle driven by a terrorist from the Islamic Movement intended to strike a number of officers and carry out an attack,\" he said in a statement. \"The officers responded and the terrorist was neutralised.\"\nThe Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement was outlawed in November 2015, after the Israeli government accused it of fomenting a wave of knife, gun and vehicle-ramming attacks by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs that has killed at least 42 people in the past 16 months.\nThe movement's Southern Branch, which recognises Israel's legitimacy and engages in national politics, has not been banned.\nSupt Rosenfeld said the officer who died was 34-year-old Sgt Maj Erez Levi.\nThe driver was meanwhile named as Yaakub Abu al-Qiyan.\nVillage activist Raed Abu al-Qiyan said he was a member of his Bedouin tribe and owned one of the structures that had been scheduled for demolition.\n\"The Israeli narrative is a lie.

A spokesman said it showed Mr Abu al-Qiyan had accelerated as he drove towards Sgt Levi.\nHowever, Israeli media said the video also appeared to show other officers walking towards the vehicle and opening fire before it increased speed.\nPublic Security Minister Gilad Erdan wrote on Twitter that the officers had called on the vehicle to stop and fired warning shots into the air, only aiming at the vehicle when it continued moving.\nFollowing Wednesday's incident, there were further clashes in Umm al-Hiran in which several other police officers were wounded, Supt Rosenfeld said.\nLocals accused them of using excessive force to remove protesters.\nPolitician Ayman Odeh, head of the Arab Joint List in the Israeli parliament, was wounded during the clashes and accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to \"enflame the area\".\nMr Erdan accused Mr Odeh of travelling to Umm al-Hiran to \"incite violence\" and warned there might be \"criminal implications for him\".\n [OUT] ",

So any increment to interest rates still looks implausible this side of an election.\nIf there is a big noise from these figures it is in the magical world of pre-election politics.\nHence this was the reaction of the Tory side of the Treasury:\n\"Final plank of Labour economic argument collapses five months before polling day with regular pay rising significantly above inflation\".\nHmmm.\nIt is true that one huge plank of Labour's attack on the Tories and Liberal Democrats was that living standards have been falling for year after grinding year on the coalition's watch.\nBut it will still be a few years yet before the net, after-everything income of a typical household is back to its previous peak.\nAnd also the Tories would presumably not wish voters to be too confident that good times are back - because history shows the electorate is less frightened of a change of government when they take prosperity for granted (by the way, I think there is little prospect of such generalised economic sangfroid).\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Highlands Fashion Week will officially launch its Bring Back The Cape (BBTC) project on its website on 4 December.\nDescribing it as an \"exclusive\" and \"secret\" project, the organisers have said that they hope to revamp the clothing that is usually worn with a kilt and \"make it current\".\nFor hundreds of people across the world, the cape as worn by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous fictional sleuth, continues to have great appeal.\nHow the popular image of Sherlock Holmes' look came about is a curious case.\nThe illustrated monthly magazine, The Strand, printed many of Conan Doyle's mysteries in the 1890s, with the author's words accompanied by engravings by talented Finchley-based artist Sidney Paget.\nAccording to The Sherlock Holmes Society of London, it was Paget who gave the detective his \"now iconic image\" - the \"hawk-like features, deerstalker cap and Inverness cape\".\nPaget produced 201 Sherlock Holmes's illustrations between 1891 and 1893 and a further 155 between 1901 and 1904.\nBut Paget had been sent the commission for the artwork by mistake.\nPinacotheca Holmesiana, a website dedicated to Sherlock stories and illustrations, said the job was meant for his younger brother Walter.\nWalter still managed to put his stamp on the sleuth. He modelled for his brother's illustrations for the magazine.\nDecades later, in television adaptations of the stories, the cape and cap continued to be a key part of Sherlock's wardrobe.\nMore recent TV portrayals, such as BBC's Sherlock and CBS series Elementary, have since restyled the detective.\nIn Sherlock, Benedict Cumberbatch's character wears a Belstaff Milford Coat - a heavy, wool tweed overcoat first made in the 1920s and inspired by the late 19th Century great coat.\nYet the image of Holmes in an Inverness cape of more than 120 years ago endures.\nMister Antony (Inverness Cape Specialists) in Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, makes Inverness raincapes in various waterproof fabrics for pipe bands all over the world.\nAbout 90% of the business's work is concerned with manufacturing this garment for pipers and drummers.\nIn 2003, the firm developed a new waterproof cape called the Bandspec Raincape. The company worked with Robert Mathieson, at the time pipe major with Shotts and Dykehead Caledonia Pipe Band, on the new design.\nMister Antony is also one of the few business that makes and supplies traditional wool and Harris Tweed Inverness capes to \"professional, discerning\" customers.\nThe patterns on offer include stony blue fleck, grey herringbone and brown and tan houndstooth.\nAntony Mistofsky, who has run the firm for 32 years and whose family has been making waterproof clothing for more than 100 years, said the custom-made items represented \"a specialised, niche market\".\nHe said: \"It would be fair to say that they are not a big selling item.\n\"We sell hundreds and not thousands of them. They can cost upwards from ÃÂ£600 depending on what the customer wants.\"\nMr Mistofsky added: \"We export them all over the world. Sixty to 70% of the woollen capes are exported, mainly to the USA.\n\"The customers who want these items are mainly professional individuals - lawyers and doctors, a High Court judge - and they buy either to wear with a kilt or as an alternative to a heavy overcoat.\"\nA few of those buying the woollen capes also have a keen interest in Sherlock Holmes, he said.\nOther Inverness Cape enthusiasts include fans of steampunk, a genre that mixes Victorian-style clothing with science-fiction technology and draws inspiration from writers such as HG Wells. Various online retailers offer the capes in colours suited to steampunk aficionados.\nHighlands Fashion Week's BBTC project, meanwhile, is timely.\nLast month, Museum of London opened the exhibition Sherlock Holmes: The Man Who Never Lived and Will Never Die.\nIt features displays of Conan Doyle manuscripts, copies of The Strand and some of the 27 surviving original drawings Paget did for the magazine stories.\nThe museum also commissioned a new tweed of a design and colour inspired by the trademark deerstalker and cape.\nAlex Werner, head of history collections at the museum, said: \"Sherlock Holmes is a global icon indelibly linked with London, so it is fitting that we are able to host this major celebration of Conan Doyle's creation at the Museum of London.\n\"This exhibition is really about gaining a deeper appreciation of the stories and it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see such a diverse collection of Sherlock Holmes artefacts and material under one roof.\"\nThe museum exhibition runs until April next year, while Highlands Fashion Week takes place in Inverness next month.\n [OUT] ",

He kept fit by swimming.\nHe had difficulty breathing last summer and eventually went to the doctor, where an X-ray examination found mesothelioma.\nMr Roberts was told he had only between nine and 12 months to live, and died at Easter of this year. He was 70.\nMs Innes said her uncle, who had been a plumber, also died of mesothelioma after discovering pains in his shoulder.\nShe said: \"It was just a simple x-ray that picked up my dad's cancer. It doesn't cost a lot of money to give an X-ray to somebody. (Carrying out screening) within a certain generation, over a certain period of time, would be ample to try and catch it at an early stage.\n\"If you catch it at an earlier stage the chemotherapy may shrink the tumour, you may then not get nine to 12 months - you can get up to five years.\"\nAt its annual general meeting on Saturday, Clydeside Action on Asbestos - the biggest asbestos charity in Scotland - called for more investment in screening, either through routine X-rays or a simple blood test that would detect illnesses.\nPhyllis Craig, the charity's chairwoman, said catching the disease at the earlier possible opportunity would allow patients to \"start making plans for their life and their families and so forth, but also to receive any form of treatment that may be available.\"\nA Scottish government spokesman said it took advice on national screening programmes from the National Screening Committee, and screening programmes are only introduced after a detailed assessment of clinical and cost effectiveness and public health benefit.\nHe added: \"The National Screening Committee has not considered screening for asbestos exposure.\"\nHe encouraged anyone who has symptoms such as difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, coughing and chest pains and who has a history of working in occupations or industries associated with asbestos exposure to contact their GP.\n [OUT] ",

The Romanians are doing all the dirty work like spam and maintenance so they are not really involved in developing malware,\" he said. \"But, today, is it mainly Russian? Yes.\"\nThose vibrant underground marketplaces have a long history and Anton adds that he tracks the malware makers to gain insights into what they might do next.\n\"I was there from the very early stages,\" Anton told the BBC. \"I guess I started at about the age of 12, when there was not much online community.\n\"Instead it was many channels where hackers exchanged information and exploits and kind of stuff like that,\" he said.\nIn those early days few wanted to break the law, he said.\n\"Back then there was not much money involved at all,\" he said. \"It was only about sharing knowledge, sharing information, sharing various scripts or downloading warez - which is pirated content.\"\n\"It gives us an insight into the directions these communities are taking.\n\"We have to monitor these to understand what they are doing, the success they are having and what they are about to do next.\n\"You have to be prepared rather than just sit back and wait for it to happen to you. It's essential for us to have this kind of contact because without it we are blind.\"\n\"There's a lot of criminality going on on the open web, particularly when you get into the Russian federation. They do not need to be on the dark web. Some are quite brazen and quite public whereas others have a much higher level of operational security.\n\"If we are tracking a criminal location and we find chatter about our clients that can be of value,\" he said. \"In the longer term it's what's coming over the horizon. What are they dialling up next?\n\"It's not trivial to do something like that, it's definitely not easy to do although I think there's definitely value in working out what they are doing.\"\nThe underground changed after the millennium turned and e-commerce took off. Forums popped up that talked about how to cash in via spam, phishing, malware and web attacks.\nThere was another big shift in 2007-08, said Anton, as the criminals sought a way to fleece people that gave better returns than the cruder techniques. The first wave, which started the modern era of cybercrime, used fake anti-virus software.\n\"They installed some really, really poorly written software on your machine,\" he said, explaining the scam. \"It looked like anti-virus but it actually does nothing.\n\"It tells you: 'We just scanned your PC and we have found many problems. You need to fix it now, you need to buy this software. It only costs $35-40 (Â£28-32)',\" he said.\nThis worked better than earlier scams, said Anton, but it took a lot of effort to catch people out and get them to pay.\nOften, he said, when people paid via a credit card they reversed the transaction once they found out they had been tricked. Conversion rates, meaning the number of victims who handed over cash, stayed low.\n\"This meant they must do something better, something more scary.\"\nFrightened people pay up, said Anton, adding that this drove the next evolution: lockers.\n\"What they do is they attack your browser and put up a big page on your main desktop, saying you were found with illegal child pornography or something very, very scary,\" he said.\n\"People got afraid saying 'OK, maybe one of my kids did it, maybe, I'm not sure, I'll pay',\".\nThe one-page attacks asked for more money, up to $200 (Â£160), and proved so successful that many police forces issued warnings that urged people not to pay.\nThe success, and also the publicity, forced the next stage of crimeware - ransomware, Anton explained.\n\"I call it an evolution because the same people that did the fake anti-virus before are doing ransomware now. And they were doing the fake police page in the years between 2010 and 2013,\" he said.\nRansomware has the best conversion rate, he said, because victims cannot ignore its effects.\n\"It's real damage so that you can see that your files are no longer working. And that's the best proof for the user that he must pay,\" he said.\nIts rise has also been helped by the advent of virtual currency Bitcoin, because it has few of the drawbacks of credit cards or other payment systems.\n\"Today you cannot talk about ransomware without mentioning Bitcoin because that's what made this evolution come,\" said Anton.\nThe damage is not just limited to the amount people pay. Estimates from the FBI suggest that the 992 cases of ransomware carrier Cryptowall reported during a 14-month period cost victims $18m (Â£14.4m). Some of the cost was in the ransom, up to $10,000 (Â£8,000), but this was multiplied by lost productivity, legal fees and work done to remove the infections.\nIt is popular, he said, because of another shift in the way that the underground is organised. In the past the groups writing the malware sent the spam, analysed the results and fleeced the victims.\nNot any more, he said. Now, many groups writing ransomware run it as a service.\n\"They will give you the software with your affiliate ID so if you spread it they will know that it's from you and you will get a payout,\" he said. \"You will get 70% and they will get the 30% out of each payment.\"\nCompetition among ransomware writers means some other groups give better returns.\nBut, he said, those groups may be producing poorly-written malware that struggles to get past the digital defences people and businesses use.\nThe evolution of the underground has hit a peak with ransomware and Bitcoin, said Anton, and their combined success has kicked off a gold rush.\n\"It's getting more and more people attracted to it, like from the criminal side. More and more people are starting to spread it.\"\nThey will not stop, either, he said. \"I think if you get easy money and it just keeps coming, why not continue it, right? It's obvious.\"\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] A study looked at the alcohol drinking habits of more than 6,100 Danish women aged between 21 and 45 years old, between June 2007 and January.\nIt found consuming less than 14 \"servings\" a week seemed to have no discernible effect on fertility, compared with women not drinking.\nBut Prof Simon Fishel said the study did not take into account miscarriages.\nOne in six couples in the UK struggles to conceive, making fertility concerns one of the most common reasons women visit their GP.\nIn the UK the current guidance on alcohol, as endorsed by the Department of Health, says that \"if you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum\".\nFertility treatment 'works for most'\nThe authors of the Danish study, published in the British Medical Journal, agree with this advice and recommend couples to abstain from alcohol during their fertile window until a pregnancy is ruled out, because the foetus may be particularly vulnerable to alcohol during the first few weeks following conception.\nThe study assessed overall alcohol consumption as well as intake of specific types of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and spirits.\nAlcohol consumption was self reported and one serving of beer was measured as a 330ml bottle, while red or white wine was a 120ml glass, dessert wine was a 50ml serving and spirits were categorised as 20ml.\nEach female participant completed a bi-monthly questionnaire for 12 months, or until conception occurred, on alcohol use, pregnancy status, menstrual cycles, frequency of intercourse, and smoking.\nWomen who drank more than 14 servings a week had an 18% lower chance of getting pregnant, the study suggested.\nThis is an observational study, and so the research cannot arise at any firm conclusions.\nHowever, in a linked editorial, Annie Britton from University College London, said that the results \"offer some reassurances\" to couples trying to get pregnant.\nShe suggests that \"total abstinence may not be necessary to maximise conception rates\" because \"if alcohol is consumed moderately, it seems that this may not affect fertility\".\n\"However, it would be wise to avoid binge drinking, both for the potential disruption to menstrual cycles and also for the potential harm to a baby during early pregnancy. If a couple are experiencing difficulty in conceiving, it makes sense for both partners to cut down on their alcohol intake,\" she said.\nWomen:\nMen:\nSource: HFEA\nBut Prof Simon Fishel, who is the managing director Care Fertility, said that while the sample size of the study was large and it showed \"excellent statistical methods\" we must not confuse a healthy pregnancy with the ability to conceive.\n\"The study implies that with up to 14 'servings' per week the chance of conceiving was no different from those who did not consume alcohol.\n\"However, as the study ended at a home pregnancy test, no measure of miscarriage or even the presence of a foetal heart was reported, giving no insight into the health of the conception.\"\nHe also said that the study said nothing about those who may be struggling to conceive, for whom alcohol intake may \"exacerbate a sub-fertile condition\".\nHowever, Prof Darren Griffin at the University of Kent said the overwhelming message of the study was \"steady as she goes\".\nHe said: \"If you do drink while trying to have children, do it in moderation and don't binge drink. One might argue that this should be a maxim for life in general.\n\"The Danish study is robust and well conducted, it is also refreshingly aware of its own limitations, such as that alcohol intake is self-reported - and thus may be under-reported - and the effect of alcohol consumption on the male partner is not measured.\n\"One interesting finding is that, although some previous studies have reported a positive effect of moderate drinking on fertility, this current study found no such association.\"\n [OUT] ",

But one that asks - how are we growing the country?\"\nScottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said the programme lacked ambition and failed to address the \"big questions\" Scotland faces in areas such as public services and jobs.\nShe added: \"Over the past decade, this parliament has become more and more powerful, but the government's programme has become less and less ambitious.\n\"The first minister and the SNP have had nearly a decade. They now have another five years.\n\"Let this be five years where focusing on jobs, public services and our economy rank as highly as the SNP's fight for independence.\"\nScottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie reminded the first minister that she was leading a minority government, and that there would need to be compromise and open-minded discussion in order for its legislative programme to be passed by Holyrood.\nHe said the new challenges brought by Brexit were against a backdrop of pre-existing challenges, and that there had not been enough progress made in working towards a \"fairer, more equal and healthier society\".\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: \"Nine years after they came to power there is no sign of the SNP are willing to drop independence and get on with the job of making our economy and services the best again.\n\"The first minister spent the whole summer talking up the prospect of a second independence referendum instead of getting on with the day job.\"\n [OUT] ",

But the music industry is concerned that fans are being excluded from concerts by \"professional\" resellers, who scoop up tickets as soon as they go on sale, then advertise them at vastly inflated prices.\nEarlier this year, tickets to see Radiohead and Adele were listed at more than 100 times their face value this year; while tickets to see Justin Bieber's Purpose tour in November are currently being advertised at Â£1,200, against a face value of Â£74.50.\nMcAndrew said this practice was \"the number one grievance\" he heard from fans.\n\"Parents write letters and fans write letters because they feel they've been ripped off,\" said Harry Magee, who manages One Direction and Little Mix.\n\"When it falls at the artist's door, you have to do something about it because it damages their career,\" he told BBC News.\nHowever, the four main secondary ticketing websites - Seatwave, Viagogo, Stubhub and Getmein - say these high prices are rarely achieved.\nStubhub has previously pointed out that 10% of their stock is sold for less than face value; and Viagogo told the BBC that \"while a seller can list a ticket at any price he likes, it doesn't mean the ticket will actually sell at that price\".\nThe sites also say that the majority of their sellers are fans, not touts.\nBut the FanFair Alliance claims the \"black market\" in ticket resale has \"reached an industrial-scale\" with touts \"operating anonymously and with impunity on under-regulated secondary ticketing sites\".\nThey are urging the government to enforce existing legislation, which would force secondary ticketing sites to reveal the identity of their sellers.\nA government-commissioned review of the market, published in May, said the sites \"are seemingly falling short\" when it comes to ensuring compliance with the legislation.\nThe review panel, chaired by Professor Michael Waterson, recommended that a body ,such as Trading Standards, \"should carry out a concerted investigation of compliance, followed by action coordinated with the police\".\nThe FanFair Alliance calls for such an investigation to begin promptly; and also asks the government to outlaw the use of \"bots\" - automated computer programs which \"harvest\" tickets when they go on sale - \"and attach appropriate penalties\" for people who employ them.\nAccording to the group, such technologies marred Black Sabbath's recent seven-date tour of the UK. It says that 11,695 tickets were listed for resale \"within minutes\" of the tour going on sale.\nThe FanFair campaign is supported by the Musicians' Union, the Association of Independent Festivals, the Association of Independent Music and the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers & Authors, amongst others.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n [OUT] ",

Four times isn't it?'\"\nAluko's evidence continued: \"This comment about the player was made with derogatory, racial and prejudicial connotations.\n\"It was also a defamatory, untrue statement given that the player has never been arrested and MS's comment indicates an assumption (subconscious or conscious) that being mixed race from London suggests a criminal record with the police.\n\"Although I was not present at the meeting, other players confirmed MS made this comment and that it was not received as a joke and created an awkward atmosphere in the room.\n\"I was deeply concerned and felt it was highly inappropriate for the national team coach to make such a sweeping negative generalisation about a new player in the team.\"\nSince making the complaint, Chelsea forward Aluko has not been picked for England and last played for country in April 2016 despite being the Women's Super League One top scorer the same year.\nHowever, she still remains a centrally contracted player, on a deal worth about Â£30,000 a year.\nReferring to the alleged incident she added: \"As a black female in the team, understanding the unfavourable, racial and social connotations underlying MS's comment further heightened my feelings of fear and isolation, especially in light of the previous instances where I have been negatively singled out, too.\"\nIn a statement, the FA said: \"Following an internal review into allegations raised by Eniola Aluko last year, The FA commissioned an independent investigation conducted by a barrister, Katharine Newton, who is an expert on employment and discrimination law.\n\"The detailed independent investigation report did not uphold any of Eniola Aluko's complaints and found no wrong-doing on behalf of The FA or others.\"\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Mrs May said the convention, which is separate from the EU, \"can bind the hands of Parliament\".\nDavid Cameron has previously refused to rule out leaving the convention.\nEx-cabinet minister and Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said her \"remarkable intervention\" had \"utterly undermined\" the government's position.\nIn her first major speech of the referendum campaign, Mrs May said the UK had to \"stand tall and lead in Europe\" rather than leaving the EU, and that membership made the UK  \"more secure from crime and terrorism\".\nShe also raised concerns about more countries joining the EU.\nThe ECHR, which is separate from the EU institutions, was incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act.\nThe Conservatives have pledged to replace the Human Rights Act with a \"British Bill of Rights\" but have not proposed leaving the convention altogether.\nBBC political editor\nThe home secretary is one of the most senior politicians in the country. Of course, her backing of the Remain campaign is important. And it's certainly better for the prime minister and the Remain campaign to have her In, rather than Out.\nBut her qualified support suggests there are three, rather than two, positions at the top of the Conservative party - 'Remain', 'Leave', and perhaps now, 'Reluctant Remain'.\nIt was the Out campaign struggling to contain their internal differences. Tonight, it feels like cracks might appear on the other side too.\nRead more from Laura\nA Downing Street spokeswoman urged journalists not to \"overdo the differences\" between the prime minister and the home secretary on withdrawal from the ECHR.\nShe said Mr Cameron \"rules nothing out\" as he seeks reform of the convention, saying the home secretary had been \"setting out a clear distinction between the ECHR and the EU\".\nRegardless of the outcome of the 23 June EU referendum, Mrs May said she still believed the UK should leave the ECHR which she said \"adds nothing to our prosperity\".\nIt was the ECHR, not the EU, that was responsible for controversial human rights decision affecting the UK, she said.\nEarlier pro-Leave Justice Secretary Michael Gove  warned that five potential new members of the EU - Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania and Turkey - would result in millions more people having the right to move to the UK.\nMrs May said Albania, Serbia and Turkey had \"poor populations and serious problems with organised crime, corruption, and sometimes even terrorism\".\nShe added: \"We have to ask ourselves, is it really right that the EU should just continue to expand, conferring upon all new member states all the rights of membership?\"\nShe said the UK had \"forgotten how to lead\" in Europe and must re-assert itself to force change from within, adding that it could veto Turkey joining the EU.\nIn her speech - and during a question and answer session - Mrs May admitted that being in the EU made it harder to control the \"volume of immigration\". But she said the UK was able to control its border by blocking entry to terrorists.\nShe praised David Cameron's leadership in trying to seek a better deal for the UK, but said the UK's collective posture was too often to \"blame Europe\" for its problems and the UK \"has to have more confidence to get things done\" rather than \"shouting from the sidelines\".\nMrs May said the issue the British public faced on 23 June was how the UK \"maximised\" its \"prosperity, security, influence and sovereignty\".\nIn what she said was an analysis of \"the risks and opportunities\" of EU membership rather than an attack on Leave campaigners, she said the post-war order had seen the UK and other countries \"cede sovereignty in a controlled way\" by co-operating to prevent a greater loss of sovereignty through military conflict or economic decline.\nMrs May said the question was not whether the UK could \"survive\" outside the EU given that it was the world's fifth largest economy which had \"friendships and alliances across the world\" - but whether the UK was \"better off in or out\".\nWhile \"the sky would not fall\" in the event of Brexit, she said she had concluded it was a matter of \"hard-headed national interest\" to remain in, based on security, trade and prosperity.\nOn security, she said EU membership enabled the UK to access EU-wide information, such as criminal records, to allow the UK to turn away serious criminals and terrorists at the border, fast-track the extradition of offenders and simplify the deportation of prisoners.\nThe UK had extensive intelligence-sharing with the US and other allies outside the EU, she said but being excluded from the EU-wide information sharing would make the UK \"less safe\".\nHowever, she called for major changes to the way the UK did business in the EU, including reducing the power of the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice.\nMr Duncan Smith told the BBC the home secretary's comments on the ECHR and EU expansion had \"thrown the gauntlet down\" to the government.\nOn EU expansion, he claimed, the prime minister is \"in favour of extending our borders to Syria\" by allowing Turkey to join the EU.\n\"She actually basically questions the very campaign she says that she supports,\" he said.\n\"This is a remarkable intervention. She has really thrown the gauntlet down and undermines the whole of the 'vote stay in' campaign.\"\nMr Duncan Smith said immigration was \"out of control\" and free movement of people rules meant the UK had to accept criminals coming into the country.\n\"An elected government in the UK elected on a platform to reduce immigration right now cannot deliver that because the EU is an open border,\" he told Radio 4's Today.\n\"You cannot reject anyone unless you can demonstrate categorically that they pose an immediate threat to the life and livelihood of the UK.\"\n [OUT] ",

Mr Fillon has already said he employed the pair for specific tasks.\nMPs and senators in France are allowed to employ family members, but Le Canard Enchaine said it had found no evidence that Penelope Fillon had ever done any work.\nThe couple were interviewed separately on Monday by investigators for more than five hours as part of a preliminary inquiry that may or may not lead to formal investigation.\nOn Tuesday morning, anti-corruption police raided parliamentary offices, reportedly in a search for contracts covering Mrs Fillon's work there.\nMr Fillon's lawyer, Antonin Levy, told French radio that the candidate had not had a constituency office while working as an MP and had instead used his home.\n\"And who is at home? Penelope Fillon of course,\" he said.\nThe head of the parliamentary Republican party, Christian Jacob, has said that MPs are unanimous in their support for Mr Fillon, 62, and are standing by him.\nBut an opinion poll for BFMTV on Tuesday suggested that 76% of French voters were unconvinced by his explanation and the affair has already hit his poll ratings.\nHe is now running neck and neck with centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, who is also likely to pick up votes from disenchanted supporters on the right of the Socialist party.\nBoth are a few points behind far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who would win 25% of the vote, but either candidate would beat her in the second round run-off in May, polls suggest.\nMr Fillon, who campaigned on his reputation for integrity and beat former president Nicolas Sarkozy and former prime minister Alain Juppe to his party's nomination, had been leading in opinion polls.\nHe has vowed to slash 500,000 public sector jobs, cut benefits and increase working time.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Because by giving the Qatari capital the chance to stage a week of running, jumping and throwing, the governing body had to let them do it away from the blast furnace that is the Gulf state's summer.\nThis means \"the world's third biggest sports event\" will start on the last weekend of September, in the middle of Japan's hosting of the Rugby World Cup, which itself claims to be the \"third biggest sports event in the world\".\nSuddenly it all makes sense. The IAAF's 27 voters were not influenced by Qatar's offer to cough up the prize money, bring in an as yet unnamed new sponsor and build 10 tracks at deserving locations. They just wanted to settle, once and for all, who gets sport's bronze medal in the mega-event stakes.\nWhich they will do, just as soon as they work out a way to go head-to-head with the Asian Games, the Champions League, the European Football Championship, the Paralympics, the Ryder Cup, the Super Bowl and every other event that has claimed to be third only in size, significance or some mix of the two, to the Summer Olympics and World Cup.\n\"Everyone knows the Olympics and World Cup are the two biggest sporting events in terms of interest and media coverage,\" explained Professor Simon Shibli, the head of Sheffield Hallam University's Sport Industry Research Centre.\n\"The best other events can hope to be is 'third biggest' and this provides a considerable unique selling point when it comes to maximising commercial rights.\n\"By claiming to be the third biggest, promoters position themselves above all other events and create the illusion they are in the same league as the big two. This is very seductive for would-be commercial partners and public-sector bodies.\"\nOr, as the man who brought the Tour de France to Yorkshire, put it: \"Saying you're the 11th biggest event in the world just lacks 'wow'.\"\nAnd that was not a message Gary Verity could take to the region's local authorities when he passed the metaphorical cloth cap around for contributions to the Grand Depart's Â£27m budget.\n\"What got the councils excited was that it is cycling's biggest event, it is unique, relatively cheap and it was outrageously ambitious,\" said the man who has spent the last five months collecting awards for pulling it off.\nVerity got his money, eventually, because he was able to look councillors in Harrogate, Holmfirth and Huddersfield in the eye and say this French bike race is the biggest event Yorkshire can ever hope to stage.\nThe Rugby World Cup's pitch is based on a combination of the number of participating nations, its television audience and the number of tickets it sells.\nIf you take those individually, it barely makes the top 10 for participants or ratings. Only for paid-up spectators will the 2015 RWC get near the medals, with its projected 2.3m tickets sold close to the London Paralympics' 2.7m.\n\"It is the third biggest global event of an international flavour,\" clarified World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper in London last month, ranking it behind a \"combined Olympics\" and football's World Cup.\n\"It's a big one, alright, and it's getting bigger.\"\nWhether he meant a combined Summer and Winter Olympics, which are different events, or a combined Summer Olympics and Paralympics, which are also different events, was unclear, but he was on a roll and it seemed rude to interrupt.\nHis answer, however, revealed how complicated this third biggest business is: how do you define big? And what is an event?\nFor Gosper, the Rugby World Cup is the culmination of a series of qualifying events over four years. So his count includes the 102 countries that entered qualification for the 2015 tournament.\nBut does that mean football's Champions League final should be viewed as the last act in a 10-month play? Is the Super Bowl the last day of a single five-month event that dominates US conversation like nothing outside of a presidential election?\n\"The problem we have is that we are comparing apples, oranges, pears and coconuts,\" explained Mike Laflin, the chief executive of the sports business analysis firm Sportcal.\n\"All the measurements are made by the relevant sports bodies themselves, so there is no uniformity.\n\"You end up with a lot of rhetoric about an event's economic impact, but most of us don't believe the numbers so there is also a lack of credibility.\"\nNowhere is that credibility more stretched than in the fantasy world of TV figures.\nLet us take the Rugby World Cup's claim of a cumulative global TV audience of 4.2bn as an example.\nThat is 87.5m per game, which is going some for a sport with only 3,000 registered players in China, 24,000 in India, 670 in Indonesia, 16,000 in Brazil, 7,000 in Pakistan, 800 in Nigeria and an unknown figure for Bangladesh - so that is 51,470 players in countries that make up half of the world's population.\nAsked to explain how a sport with patchy global appeal can generate such huge audiences, World Rugby's Alan Gilpin, who heads up organisation of the World Cup, said more than 20,000 hours would be broadcast from next year's tournament to 200 countries, including, for the first time, Greenland (population 56,483).\nWhen pushed for more detail on this, Gilpin said, whilst fighting a smile: \"It is based on the number of segments people watch, and that is the same metric everybody else uses.\"\nA segment, in case you are wondering, is somebody watching for 20 minutes, so it is possible that 25m people could deliver an audience of 100m. That still seems far-fetched for Tonga versus Georgia.\nBut Gilpin is right: everybody is at it. The last big football tournament in this country, Euro 96, claimed an audience of 6.7bn, the Tour de France talks about its 3.5bn viewers and some of the more excitable Chinese sources suggested as many as 4bn watched the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\"We need an agreed framework of what is meant by TV audiences and to apply it consistently,\" said Sheffield Hallam's Shibli.\n\"There has been a lot of bravado in the battle to be the world's third biggest sports event, and TV audiences have been stretched to the point of being ludicrous.\n\"We now routinely get estimates of how many households a broadcast can reach, rather than how many people actually watched it.  Other tenuous inclusions feature coverage on news programmes and in-flight entertainment on aeroplanes!\"\nYou could argue there is no harm done if everybody is doing it, but Sportcal's Laflin thinks harm is being done to sport's inherent value.\n\"We need a better way to sell these events than just these figures that nobody really believes,\" he explained.\n\"These events are actually undervalued because sport doesn't understand its product very well.\n\"We should focus more on the social benefits, national pride, volunteers, that kind of thing. The 2011 Rugby World Cup had huge intangible benefits for New Zealand.\n\"Ask London or Vancouver if they would have the Olympics back - of course they would!\"\nThis \"more holistic approach\" to measuring size is behind Laflin's Global Sports Impact (GSI) project.\nMore than 200 experts were asked to come up with a list of the most important factors in ranking an event - tickets sold, tourists attracted, media impact and so on - and these were applied to 700 events over a 12-year period.\nThe results are fascinating, as the 2011 Rugby World Cup is ranked fourth, behind London's Olympics, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and 2012 Paralympics. So Gosper was on to something.\nThe IAAF will be less happy, though, as the 2013 Worlds in Moscow are down in 11th, sandwiched between this year's Asian Games in South Korea and the Youth Olympic Games in China.\nWhile it is fun to puncture a few puffed-up claims, there is a serious point.\nWith western democracies increasingly reluctant to put up the cash required to win bids for big sporting events, there is a danger they will give up, leaving the field clear for politicians from countries where they are less worried about things like elections.\nClearly, there are benefits for sport in dealing with nations that can stage events without too many questions, particularly if they happen to be wealthy, but nobody wants these bidding contests to become walkovers.\nIt is something Simon Morton spends a long time pondering. As the boss of the team at UK Sport that uses National Lottery money to bid for world-class events, Morton needs to know where the value is.\n\"The global market for sports events is quite immature, which can be a bad thing in that there are some real turkeys out there, but also an opportunity because you can pick up some bargains,\" said Morton, who has secured 10 world or European-level events between now and the Rio Olympics in 2016.\n\"But we don't talk about size so much, we talk about strategic value to the UK, and on that basis we are delighted to have won the bid to stage the World Athletics Championships in 2017.\n\"This concept of biggest can be misleading. We look for public engagement, how it will benefit our elite performers and what the event's legacy will be. They are things we can measure.\"\nSo perhaps size is not important, after all, and what really matters is not how big your event is, but what you do with it.\nThat said, it can only be a matter of time before people start arguing about which event has the third best legacy.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] But this is not a country which often finds itself dominating the headlines.\nSo what do people actually know about Qatar, apart from it hosting the football World Cup in 2022?\nHere are five facts to get you started.\nIn a country of about 2.5 million people, there are fewer than 700,000 women.\nThis imbalance can be attributed to Qatar's sudden population explosion: this is a state built by immigrants, who are overwhelmingly young and male.\nThe promise of a job has meant people have flooded into Qatar - which is about the same size as Yorkshire - in recent years, taking its population from less than 700,000 in 2003, to an estimated 2.5 million in 2016.\nWhile there are female migrants, the vast majority are men building the infrastructure needed for the upcoming World Cup.\nThey come from all over the world, although the largest numbers come from India and Nepal, making Hindus the third largest religious group in the country, after Muslims and Christians, according to the CIA's World Factbook.\nHowever, despite the promise of work and a better future, several reports in recent years have said migrants are being forced to work in appalling conditions, with more than half still living in labour camps around the country.\nQatar has promised to improve life for its workers, but Amnesty International's report for 2016/17 said they  \"continued to face exploitation and abuse\".\nQatar has been busy over the last decade or so buying up large swathes of London.\nIts portfolio includes, but is not limited to, the Shard, Harrods, Chelsea Barracks and the Olympic Village, as well having a stake in Canary Wharf.\nAli Shareef al-Emadi, the country's finance minister, told the BBC in March he estimated the country had \"more than Â£35bn to Â£40bn ($45bn to $51bn) of investments already in the UK\".\nWhat's more, Mr Emadi said the country was planning to invest another Â£5bn in the UK over the next three to five years - including more property.\nQatar is known as a conservative country, yet, in the last few years it has sponsored a number of exhibitions - including hosting the somewhat controversial artist Damien Hirst's first solo retrospective in the Middle East, in 2013.\nThe same year Sheikha al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani - the sister of the emir, and head of Qatar Museums Authority - topped the Art Review's Power 100.\nAt one time, it was rumoured she was spending up to $1bn a year on art, with work from Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Paul Gauguin and Paul CÃ©zanne all making their way into the collection.\nThe country also boasts the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, which opened in 2008. It is said to house one of the most comprehensive collections of Islamic art in the world, exhibiting works from across three continents and 1,400 years.\nQatar's love of art has spilled over from the museums and into its public spaces.\nIndeed, anyone who has ever been through Doha's Hamad International Airport could not have missed the 23-foot yellow teddy sitting in the middle of the terminal.\nLamp/Bear was created by Swiss artist Urs Fischer more than a decade ago, is cast from bronze and weighs almost 20 tonnes.\nAccording to Hamad International Airport's official description, the bear is a \"playful piece that humanises the space around it and reminds travellers of childhood or precious objects from home\".\nBut this playful piece did not come cheap: the cast bronze sculpture was bought at auction in New York for $6.8m (Â£5.3m) back in 2011.\nHow does such a small country pay for all this? Well, thanks to its oil and gas reserves, as well as some good investments, Qatar has the highest GDP per capita in the world.\nIn 2016, it was $129,700 (Â£100,500) - more than $20,000 higher than the next closest country, Luxembourg, the CIA's World Factbook said.\nAt the other end of the scale, Somalia's GDP was estimated to be just $400 per head.\nHowever, Qatar's wealth is in no way equally spread. The former Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, is reportedly worth $2.4bn.  But migrants interviewed by the BBC in 2015 revealed they were earning as little as $350 a month.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Mr Mohamed told me at the World Economic Forum in Jakarta that a single monetary policy was out of the question in the near future, as we discussed lessons from the European experience that could apply to the Asean Economic Community (AEC) that is due to launch at the end of year.\nHe pointed to the vastly different levels of income in Asean which would make sharing a currency - and therefore monetary policy - infeasible. He told me that there would not be the equivalent of the European Central Bank in the AEC in the foreseeable future.\nMalaysia is chair of Asean and will lead the conclusion of the talks to form a single market that will rival the EU in terms of population.\nWith more than 600 million people, Asean is seeking to link together 10 countries ranging from rich Singapore to poor Laos in a free trade area, with free movement of labour, removal of tariffs, and common standards.\nMr Mohamed is confident that the AEC will soon rival the EU and could overtake it by 2025. He cited the 5%-plus economic growth rate of Asean, as compared to the 1-2% growth of the EU.\nStill, there are numerous challenges facing the formation of the AEC. There aren't many pan-regional institutions, for one.\nTony Fernandes, the chief executive of AirAsia, one of the few pan-Asean companies, called for a strong commission for the AEC. Instead of going to 10 different governments, he would like to see the equivalent of the European Commission in the AEC. Although, Mr Fernandes added, he would prefer a less bureaucratic version of the Commission in Asean.\nOthers, such as the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, have called for institutions to protect human rights and workers, including a court like the European Court of Justice.\nThat will be challenging, as political differences in the region - including numerous non-democratic states - will make it tough to integrate politically, as well as socially. Those are the two other unsurprising pillars of the AEC, which mirrors the development of European institutions, since tying markets together requires more than just economic agreements.\nBesides institutions, the region also faces challenges in terms of what economists call \"deep\" integration. There are many trade links in the region, but intra-regional trade in Asean is only about a quarter of total trade as compared with the EU or, in particular, the eurozone, where the biggest trade partners are the other economies in Europe.\nTrade has increased in the past few decades, but it is non-tariff barriers protecting some home industries that remain barriers.\nMr Mohamed also emphasised that the impetus behind the AEC is to compete with the sizeable markets of the EU and US, as well as neighbouring China and India.\nMr Fernandes also pointed to the rise of regional free trade agreements being negotiated, such as the TPP linking America to Asia, and TTIP tying the US to the EU, as to why there is urgency for South East Asia to link their economies to compete.\nWith twice the population of the United States and one that is similar to the scale of the EU, the AEC has potential to become one of the largest economic entities in the world. And Mr Mohamed is not only confident that the AEC will overtake the EU, he also believes that the AEC could rival the United States one day.\nWe'll soon see if the AEC becomes a common reference point for the rest of the world like the EU is, and if it can become a market like the US that global businesses have to be in. It seems that South East Asians certainly have that ambition.\n [OUT] ",

I reject these.\n\"While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will, I am innocent of any part in the abduction, killing or burial of Mrs McConville.\"\nHis party colleague Alex Maskey condemned the timing of the arrest, just over three weeks from the European and local government elections.\nHowever, Mrs McConville's son Michael, who was 11 when his mother was murdered, welcomed the arrest.\n\"We're just happy to see everything moving as it is moving at the minute,\" Mr McConville said.\n\"Me and the rest of my brothers and sisters are just glad to see the PSNI doing their job. We didn't think it would ever take place [Mr Adams' arrest], but we are quite glad that it is taking place.\n\"All we're looking for is justice for our mother. Our mother, on the seventh of next month, would have been 80 years of age.\n\"Although we didn't spend much time with our mother, we'd have like to have spent a lot of time with her. If the IRA hadn't have killed our mother, God knows, she still might have been alive today.\"\nMr McConville said what he really wanted was for the perpetrators to be tried as \"war criminals\" at the international court in the Hague, rather than being brought before courts in Northern Ireland.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson said he \"commends the police for the action they have taken\".\nSources: Chronicle of Higher Education, New York Times\nSpeaking to the media on Thursday, he said: \"It strengthens our political process in Northern Ireland for people to know that no one is above the law, everyone is equal under the law and everyone is equally subject to the law.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron said there had been \"absolutely no political interference in this issue\".\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny also rejected suggestions from senior Sinn FÃ©in figures that the arrest of Mr Adams had been politically motivated.\n\"This is still a live murder case, this is still a live investigation,\" he said.\n\"All I can say is that I hope the president of Sinn FÃ©in answers in the best way he can, to the fullest extent that he can, questions that are being asked about a live murder investigation.\"\nMrs McConville, one of Northern Ireland's Disappeared, was kidnapped in front of her children after being wrongly accused of being an informer.\nThe claim that she was an informer was dismissed after an official investigation by the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman.\nMrs McConville was held at one or more houses before being shot and buried in secret.\nThe Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Troubles.\nThe IRA admitted in 1999 that it murdered and buried at secret locations nine of the Disappeared.\nThe Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains was established in 1999 by a treaty between the British and Irish governments.\nIt lists 16 people as \"disappeared\". Despite extensive searches, the remains of seven of them have not been found.\nOn its website, the commission said all information it received was privileged - it can not be passed on to other agencies or used in a court of law.  It can only be used to try and locate the remains of the Disappeared.\nJean McConville's remains were found in 2003 by a man walking at Shelling Hill beach, near Carlingford.\nIt is understood that because Mrs McConville's body was found by accident by a member of the public rather than through information given to the commission, a criminal investigation can take place.\nLast month, Ivor Bell, 77, a leader in the Provisional IRA in the 1970s, was charged  with aiding and abetting the murder.\nThere have also been a number of other arrests over the murder recently.\nThe case against Bell is based on an interview he allegedly gave to researchers at Boston College in the US.\nThe Boston College tapes are a series of candid, confessional interviews with former loyalist and republican paramilitaries, designed to be an oral history of the Troubles.\nThe paramilitaries were told the tapes would only be made public after their deaths.\nHowever, after a series of court cases in the United States, some of the content has been handed over to the authorities.\nMr Adams has never been charged with membership of the IRA. He was, however, interned in 1972 under the controversial Special Powers Act, but briefly released in order that he could take part in talks in London between representatives of Sinn Fein and the then Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw.\nHe was later re-arrested and interned at Long Kesh.

Colleges across Scotland have merged into a series of so-called \"regional supercolleges\".\nMergers in any field can often be difficult - they can lead to job losses and the inevitable challenges of  bringing together the culture and practices of different institutions.\nThese concerns were exacerbated by rows over pay offs for some senior staff. The public spending watchdog raised concerns about the practices followed by some.\nAt the former Coatbridge College there were claims of collusion though, when questioned by MSPs, the former principal denied any wrongdoing.\nIndeed at some colleges, the merger process itself has been difficult.\nA distinct but related debate has also been going on. This is the question of  just what role colleges should have in the education system.\nColleges were told to focus on full time courses which led to recognised qualifications - such as HNCs And HNDs.\nTheir principle aim is to help develop the skills of the workforce and, perhaps inevitably, an even higher proportion of the students than before are in their teens or 20s.\nThe number of part time student numbers fell dramatically.\nA report by Audit Scotland argued there was no evidence that students had suffered from the shake up but also questioned whether there had been any actual benefits beyond savings.\nThis big shake up in the system inevitably colours the question of pay.\nEach college used to have its own pay and conditions. But a move back to national pay deals has thrown up discrepancies between institutions.\nDealing with those would inevitably be an expensive, long term business.\nA formal vote on industrial action is expected within weeks and some in the EIS Further Education Lecturers Association anticipate a strike in February if the issue is not resolved.\nSome in the colleges sector have long complained that they can feel as if they're overlooked: political, media and public attention can, some argue, tend to focus unduly on schools and universities.\nAny national college dispute, in the run up to May's Holyrood election, could certainly put the focus on the sector.\n [OUT] ",

Gradually they sort of got the message through. But it took a few knocks at the door.\"\nTwelve months on, he is mouthing very similar sentiments as he owns up to a positive test for cocaine.\nFriday's apology, on the second floor of a West London hotel, sounded impressive and genuine - but Evans does not need anyone to knock on the door to remind him what a complete and utter fool he has been.\nHe has worked very hard in the past two years, from a nadir of 772 in the rankings, to establish himself as a top-50 player.\nWith the assistance of coach Mark Hilton, he has reached at least the third round in three of the past four Grand Slams, and at 27 could perhaps have been approaching the most successful and lucrative years of his career. He has won over half a million pounds in the past 12 months alone, and earned generous praise from Andy Murray.\nBut now he rightly faces a lengthy ban from the sport, and who knows what his motivation levels will be when he returns, presumably unranked, to the lower levels of the Futures circuit.\n\"Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.\" So reads the tattoo on Evans' left forearm, and he has done his best to live up to Oscar Wilde's words throughout his career.\nIf the past two years represent his saintly period, and I appreciate I am stretching the analogy here, his previous history was a chequered one.\nHe has twice been stripped of his LTA funding: in 2008, for four months, when he was caught drinking until the early hours with Daniel Smethurst on the eve of a Wimbledon junior doubles match. The governing body has brandished both carrot and stick over the years - mindful of his prodigious talent.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEvans had a glorious 10 days in New York in the late summer of 2013 as he not only qualified for the US Open but also beat Kei Nishikori and Bernard Tomic before falling to Tommy Robredo in the third round. But one swallow did not make a summer in that particular year.\nThe ranking points had presented him with a platform to break into the top 100 for the first time, but 12 months later he was outside the world's top 250. It was known he was not putting in the necessary hours in the gym, and by late 2014 Evans was virtually estranged from the LTA's performance department.\nIn the words of his former coach, the late Julien Hoferlin, at Wimbledon that year: \"He has the potential to make himself a top-60 player, but he makes no sacrifices for his sport.\n\"He doesn't understand that tennis has to be his priority. For him, it's just a brief interlude in his life.\"\nIn March of the following year, Evans failed to show up for his singles match at a Futures event on the Wirral. He had been celebrating St Patrick's Day, and was fined Â£350.\nBut then something fell into place and, until this positive test, Evans had managed to balance the life of a top professional with the lifestyle of a thrill-seeker who likes a beer and the company of his mates. A non-playing member of the squad, he celebrated the Davis Cup victory of 2015 with British fans in a Ghent hostelry.\nAnd he has not been afraid to express an opinion.\nHe has made it quite clear what he thinks of Aljaz Bedene playing under the British flag, and took Kevin Pietersen to task in Melbourne earlier this year for refusing to pose for a photo with him outside the city's casino.\nBut then, all of a sudden, Evans' newly discovered self-discipline faltered. Temptation became too great, and his ability to self-destruct resurfaced.\nHis legal team will be far busier during Wimbledon than will he. Their work over the next few months may determine how likely Evans is to return to Grand Slam tennis.\nHis former Davis Cup captain John Lloyd is in two minds.\n\"Dan's become such a world-class player and has just looked the part in so many ways, I was quite frankly flabbergasted,\" he told the BBC.\n\"This is obviously the most serious thing that he's done by a long, long way. It's very sad but at some stage you've just got to say how many chances do you need to have?\n\"You're an adult and you can't keep getting away with things and rebounding.\"\n [OUT] ",

At the end, the agreement must of course be approved by the Council and European Parliament. Finally the UK will have to approve the agreement - all within the two year period.\n\"All in all there will be less than 18 months to negotiate. That is short. Should the UK notify by the end of March as Prime Minister Theresa May said she would, it is safe to say negotiations could start a few weeks later and an Article 50 deal reached by October 2018.\"\nMr Barnier, making his first public speech on the issue, was appointed to the post of chief Brexit negotiator on 1 October this year by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who said he \"wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job\".\nThe chief negotiator said he had spent time speaking to European member governments and said the Brexit negotiations had been informed by four main principles.\nThese included the \"determination for unity\" and a pledge to not start negotiations before being officially notified by the UK of its desire to leave, via the triggering of Article 50.\nHe also said: \"Being a member of EU comes with rights and benefits. Third countries (non members as the UK will be after Brexit) can never have the same rights and benefits since they are not subject to the same obligations.\n\"The single market and its four freedoms (which includes freedom of movement) are indivisible. Cherry picking is not an option.\"\nThe BBC's Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas asked Mr Barnier if the UK \"paying in\" to stay in the single market was a possibility after Brexit Secretary David Davis said last week the government \"would consider it\".\n\"There is access to the single market, but this is accompanied by predetermined, very specific contribution to the EU budget,\" said the chief negotiator.\n\"That is one of the models that already exists and that is one of the closest models there is to the EU without being a member.\"\nBut Mr Barnier added there were various options and until Article 50 had been called, there was little more he could say.\n\"It is up to the UK to tell us what they have in mind, then it is up to us at the 27 [member states] to say what we are prepared to conceive of.\"\nMr Barnier said he \"didn't like to speculate very much\" on what the future relationship between the EU and the UK would be, but it was time to \"keep calm and negotiate\".\n\"The sooner, the better,\" he added. \"We all have a common interest in not prolonging the lack of certainty and we for our part need to concentrate on the European agenda on this new page that we will be writing in the history in the construction of the EU.\n\"There will be rebalancing but my conviction remains the same. Europe has to be the bedrock on which European citizens can lean in order to push ahead and construct the EU further for their safety, security, defence and prosperity.\"\n\"It is much better to show solidarity than to stand alone.\"\nAnalysis - Damian Grammaticas, BBC Europe correspondent\nThe EU appears to be signalling loud and clear what is on offer to the UK - and what isn't.\nThis isn't the EU playing hardball. That's to misread the EU's cues. And it isn't new. EU leaders have reiterated the same principles ever since the UK referendum.\nFrom their point of view, their position is logical and consistent. EU leaders believe they have built the world's most integrated single market. They don't want to unpick parts of it for one nation that is leaving. Preserving their union is their priority.\nSo, Michel Barnier made clear that the UK cannot expect better terms outside the EU than inside. UK talk of getting a special deal that privileges the car industry or the City of London may not to be acceptable to the EU. As for paying to get access to the Single Market, that's possible Mr Barnier hinted - if, like Norway, you accept the EU's rules.\nBut 'cherry-picking' won't happen, he said. Importantly too, he indicated, a Brexit deal will cover the exit terms.\nThe UK's future relationship with the EU will, in all likelihood, have to be settled later, once the UK is out of the EU and has the status of a third country. It's not about driving a hard bargain. The EU is signalling it has its rules and principles, and isn't offering to change them.\nDowning Street said it was sticking to its timetable despite the speech from Mr Barnier.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"In terms of how long the negotiations actually take place, clearly that is a matter that will resolve itself as a result of the negotiations.\"\nHe said that the position of the rest of the EU on the timetable was a \"matter for them\".\nBut on the 18-month timetable, he said: \"It is the first I have heard of it.\"\nMrs May said getting the right deal for British people would benefit the EU.\nSpeaking to the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar - before Mr Barnier's comments - on her two-day trip to Bahrain, Theresa May said: \"People talk about the sort of Brexit that there is going to be. Is it hard or soft? Is it grey or white?\n\"Actually we want a red, white and blue Brexit; that is the right Brexit for the UK, the right deal for the UK. I believe that a deal that is right for the UK will also be a deal that is right for the EU.\"\nOn the issue of revealing more of those plans to Parliament, the prime minister said she still wanted \"to keep some cards close to my chest\".\nBut Mrs May said regardless of the outcome of this week's Supreme Court case - on whether the government can trigger Article 50 alone or need parliamentary approval - she would \"deliver on the vote of the British people.\"\nHilary Benn, chairman of the Brexit Select Committee and Labour MP, believes talk of an 18-month time limit will add extra pressure.\nHe told BBC News: \"It means there is going to be a very short time from the triggering of Article 50 to negotiate the divorce arrangements and crucially what our new relationship with Europe is going to be once we have left, when it comes to trade and the single market.\n\"What I think he has said reinforces the argument that I have been making that we are going to need transitional arrangements [around the negotiations].\"\nMr Barnier said a short term agreement \"could have some point\" in helping move towards a final deal.\nBut Boris Johnson said 18 months is \"ample time\" for the UK to negotiate with the EU.\nSpeaking as he arrived at a NATO meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, the Foreign Secretary said: \"With a fair wind and everybody acting in a positive and compromising mood, as I'm sure they will, we can get a great deal for the UK and for the rest of Europe\".\nWhen in charge of regional policy, Mr Barnier said he worked on a programme supporting Northern Ireland and the Good Friday agreement.\nWhen asked by The Irish Times whether he would dismiss the idea of a hard border being put in place post-Brexit, he would not commit either way.\n\"The UK decision to leave the EU will have consequences, in particular perhaps for what are the EU's external borders today,\" he said.\n\"All I can say at this moment in time is I am personally extremely aware of this particular topic. We will throughout these negotiations with the UK and of course with Ireland, do our utmost to uphold the success of the Good Friday Agreement and of course retain the dialogue there.\"\nA former EU commissioner, Mr Barnier led the EU's banking reforms and was dubbed \"the most dangerous man in Europe\" by some in the financial services industry.\nBut after he championed capping bankers' bonuses, he won respect as a tough but even-handed negotiator.\nMr Barnier has refused to take part in any pre-negotiations before Article 50 is triggered, but he did meet Brexit Secretary David Davis for coffee last month.\nSpeaking in November in Brussels, he said: \"Don't ask me to tell you what will be at the end of the road, we haven't begun to walk yet.\"\n [OUT] ",

Uganda's Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi said that the video wrongly gave the impression that the country was still at war.\nTitled Kony 2012: Beyond Famous, the new release begins with the huge media reaction to the initial release, highlighting the mainstream media coverage the video gained across the US.\nBy Martin PlautAfrica editor, BBC News\nThis film is a huge improvement on the first version. Still very slick, it uses African voices to make the case for ending the threat from Joseph Kony. As the former Ugandan presidential candidate Norbert Mao puts it: \"Let those who are the professors write their books and create academic awareness. But this one grabs your gut and shakes you until you are forced to pay attention.\"\nThe campaign says it has already chalked up achievements: two resolutions in the US Congress signed by nearly 100 members. Without this kind of pressure political support for the US special forces tracking Kony could easily evaporate. It's claimed that since the first film was shown another 57 people have been abducted by his murderous group - the Lord's Resistance Army.\nThe need for action is real and immediate, even though the campaign is somewhat vague about whether it wants Kony dead or in custody. But who can argue with the basic message: \"The human connection extends around the world?\"\nBut it quickly switches focus to Africa, with more voices from Uganda than were featured in the emotive first release.\nThat film struck a chord with a younger generation not often engaged with the traditional news agenda.\n\"This generation has responded to the call to make Joseph Kony famous,\" the group said, promising to take the \"next step\" on 20 April.\n\"Part II gives a closer look at the Lord's Resistance Army, the international efforts to stop them, the progress that has already been made, and what we can all do to help,\" the group said.\nSome US senators claimed to have been alerted to the problem by their children amid the popularity of the first release.\n\"All three of my kids, in different context and different times have said: 'So what are you doing about Joseph Kony and the LRA?\"' Senator Chris Coons told the Associated Press.\nMr Coons is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations African affairs sub-committee. He has travelled to Africa to hear about the issue firsthand.\nA recent report from the US Pew Research centre concluded that the first film represented a new way for young people consume news.\nIt found that 40% of 18-29 year-olds had heard about the video, compared with 20% of 30-49-year-olds and 18% of 50-64-year-olds.\nThe younger age group was also far more likely to have viewed the video. The majority had heard about it via social networks such as Twitter.\n\"The 30-minute video... provided striking evidence that young adults and their elders at times have different news agendas and learn about news in different ways,\" the report said.\nInvisible Children's co-founder Jason Russell is currently in hospital after he was found semi-naked and screaming at traffic in the streets of San Diego.\nHe made himself the focus of the first film and came in for some heavy criticism from other advocacy groups and aid agencies.\nMany criticised the Kony 2012 project for prescribing a \"colonialist\" approach to the issue of the LRA without empowering Africans to fix their own problems.\n [OUT] ",

This is the question on the minds of many South Africans after the deaths of 13 soldiers in fighting with rebels in the troubled Central African Republic.\nSouth Africa has for years prided itself on having one of the most organised armies in Africa but the deaths of these men begs the question: \"Could the government have avoided this?\"\nPresident Zuma says just over 200 troops were deployed to the CAR in  January, half the number that was expected to have been sent to  support and train the poorly trained and ill-equipped forces of ousted President Francois Bozize. But officials are now hard-pressed to explain the role the South African soldiers were expected to play in the event of an attack.\nCritics say the government may have underestimated the rebel threat and therefore did not react appropriately. Others have questioned why South Africa's role did not change from trainer to fighter when it became clear weeks ago that the rebels were gaining ground.\nThere are still many unanswered questions but some have accused the government of poor judgement, saying the incident has not only caused embarrassment for the army, but for South Africa as a key player in peace missions in Africa.\nHowever, another rebel leader, Nelson N'Djadder, told Associated Press news agency that he did not recognise Mr Djotodia as the new leader of CAR.\n\"We had agreed that we would push to Bangui in order to arrest Bozize and that we would then announce an 18-month transition, a transition that would be as fast as possible and not one that would last three years,\" Mr N'Djadder told AP from Paris.\n\"I have enough soldiers loyal to me to attack Djotodia.

Instead, he endured repeated beatings and torture, including two years in solitary confinement.\nThe six-term senator now faces another grave battle, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.\nMr McCain had surgery to remove a blood clot from near his left eye on 14 July, and was found to have an aggressive form of brain tumour known as glioblastoma.\nWell-wishes from across the political divide saw four former presidents praise his tenacity, with President Trump sending his \"thoughts and prayers\", and Barack Obama - his rival for the presidency in 2008 - commenting, \"John McCain is an American hero... Cancer doesn't know what it's up against.\"\nMr McCain stayed in the armed forces after his return to the US, ultimately acting as naval liaison to the Senate until his retirement in 1981.\nIt was at this point that he moved to Arizona to embark on a political career, winning a congressional seat in 1982 and securing a Senate seat four years later.\nRunning against George W Bush for the 2000 presidential nomination, Mr McCain's direct style won him initial support and he secured a surprise victory in the New Hampshire primary.\nBut he was hit by a number of attacks as campaigning turned increasingly negative, and later fell out with influential members of the so-called \"religious right\".\nThe choice of Christian conservative Sarah Palin as running mate for his 2008 presidential campaign was designed to win over such Republicans.\nMr McCain has never been afraid to adopt a controversial position - especially since Donald Trump's emergence in politics.\nThough he has since hardened some of his views, he has previously attracted the ire of social conservatives for his relatively moderate views on civil unions, abortion and immigration reform.\nHe was one of the Iraq war's strongest supporters, and backed the troop increase there known as the \"surge\".\nAs chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee he has been a vocal - and hawkish - force in foreign policy and military affairs.\nWhile battling Mr Obama for the White House, Mr McCain stressed his own experience in these areas and argued that he would make a far better commander-in-chief.\nThe Arizona Senator has repeatedly criticised President Trump's warming relations with Russia, and spent New Year's Eve 2016 with Ukrainian Marines.\n\"We stand w/them in their fight against #Putin's aggression,\" he tweeted then.\nMr McCain withdrew his support for Mr Trump - then his party's presidential nominee - in October 2016, the day after a 2005 recording emerged of him making obscene remarks about women and appearing to trivialise sexual assault.\n\"When Mr Trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and in our society, that is a point where I just have to part company,\" he said.\nIn July 2017, he told CBS's Face the Nation that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"got away with\" trying to change the result of the 2016 US presidential election.\nThe Republican elder has repeatedly shown himself willing to work with Democrats or vote against his party on ideological grounds, including when he voted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and against George W Bush's tax cuts.\nHe co-sponsored a bipartisan immigration bill in 2007 which, had it passed, would have offered an amnesty to illegal immigrants as well as tougher border controls.\nAnd he was the author, with Democrat Senator Russ Feingold, of a major campaign finance reform in 2002 intended to reduce the influence of money and pressure groups in US elections.\nHe has criticised President Trump's refugee travel ban, saying it betrays American values and \"in some areas, will give Isis [Islamic State] some more propaganda\".\nWhen news broke of the president's confrontational first phone call with Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mr McCain phoned Australia's US ambassador, Joe Hockey, to express \"unwavering support\" for the countries' relationship.\nIn 2017, Mr McCain travelled to war-torn Syria to visit US forces deployed there.\nHe called the Trump administration's decision not to prioritise ending the Syrian civil war \"another disgraceful chapter in American history\".\nAs news emerged of his cancer diagnosis, the senator's office said he was \"in good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family\".\nHis family reacted with \"shock\" to the news, his 32-year-old daughter Meghan said.\n\"It won't surprise you to learn that in all of this, the one of us who is most confident and calm is my father,\" she said on Twitter.\n\"So he is meeting this challenge as he has every other.

If that is the case, the feasibility of a bucardo recovery plan will be discussed,\" Dr Fernandez-Arias, who is head of the Aragon Hunting, Fishing and Wetlands Service, explained.\nThe bucardo (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) was a sub-species of ibex, with distinct physical and genetic characteristics to other mountain goats inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula. It was perfectly adapted to life in its mountain habitat, and to survive the extreme cold and snow of winter in the Pyrenees.\nHowever, its population had been declining for years for several reasons, including hunting. In April 1999, researchers captured the last animal, a female named Celia. They obtained skin biopsies and froze the tissue in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196C (-321F).\nThe following year, Celia was killed by a falling tree in the National Park of Ordesa in north-east Spain. But a team including Dr Fernandez-Arias, Jose Folch and others were able to inject nuclei from Celia's preserved cells into goat eggs that had been emptied of their own DNA.\nThen they implanted the eggs into surrogates - hybrids between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. Of 57 implantations, seven animals became pregnant and one was carried to term.\nThe baby bucardo was born in 2003 - the first successful \"de-extinction\". But the clone of Celia died a few minutes later due to a defect in one of its lungs. Earlier this year, Dr Fernandez-Arias related the story in a TEDx talk, as part of a meeting on de-extinction.\nEven if the new effort succeeds in producing healthy clones, any future recovery plan for the bucardo would be fraught with difficulty - especially given the only frozen tissue is from a lone female.\nOne possible approach for bringing back the bucardo might be to cross a healthy female bucardo clone with a closely related sub-species - such as the Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) or the Gredos ibex (Capra pyrenaica victoriae) - and then selectively breeding the offspring to enhance traits typical of the bucardo.\nSeveral other possibilities could also be explored. For instance, researchers have been able to reverse the sex of female mouse embryos by introducing a key gene that makes them develop as males.\nIn addition, George Church, professor of genetics at Harvard University, explained that a technique known as Crispr opened up new opportunities in the field of endangered species conservation and de-extinction. The technique allows researchers to edit genomes with extraordinary precision.\nSuch \"genome editing\" techniques could be used to introduce genetic diversity in populations that are so closely related it poses a threat to their survival.\n\"In some cases, you have a hunch as to what diversity is needed. You might specifically want diversity in the major histocompatibility complex [a large gene family involved in immune responses],\" Prof Church told BBC News.\n\"For example, part of the problem with the Tasmanian devil is that they are so closely related in terms of their immune system that they have problems rejecting the facial tumour cells that they spread by biting each other.\"\nHowever, he said, such techniques might eventually offer a way to extensively edit the genome of an Asian elephant to make it more like a mammoth, using a genetic sequence from the extinct animals.\nCommenting on plans for the bucardo cells, the Aragon Hunting Federation said it wanted to \"develop initiatives in the field of ecology in order to defend the natural environment\".\nThe sum provided to fund the research at CITA has not been disclosed.\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter\n [OUT] ",

Women are likely to be hit harder, as in low income families they tend to make more frequent purchases that will be squeezed as money is stretched.\"\nThere are concerns too that the payment of Universal Credit to one person in a household could, in some instances, upset the family dynamic: potentially putting that individual in a position of considerable power and influence.\nMany of those who have submitted evidence are worried about how some people will cope when the changeover from the current benefits system to the Universal Credit takes place.\n\"What consideration has been given to providing grants to cover a shortfall when transitioning from fortnightly to monthly payments, rather than claimants having to rely on budgeting advances or 'pay-day loans' which need to be re-paid?\" asks Gingerbread, the charity for single parents.\nManchester City Council raise a broader concern: the effects not just on people, but communities.\n\"We have concerns about the impacts on people but also on 'place' - either from large scale churn de-stabilising people and communities or reductions in income within areas with high concentrations of people currently on benefit.\"\nLet's now turn to look at some of practical problems around making this change happen on time.\nA wide range of organisations involved in meeting the government's deadline are clearly very worried about achieving it.\nAt the heart of the Universal Credit is what is known as the Real Time Information system. The aim is it will be much more responsive to people's changing circumstances.\nIt will require employers to report their employees' pay each time they are paid. In addition the self-employed will have to report their income every month instead of every year.\nThis will be a \"significant and difficult burden, reliant on information from others\", the Chartered Institute of Taxation tells the MPs.\nThe success of the Universal Credit depends on the new computer system being completed \"under extremely tight timelines,\" the employers' organisation, the CBI says.\n\"The new system's tight delivery timetable, coupled with low awareness among companies, is a risk to business and to the implementation of the Universal Credit.\"\n\"There is a real risk that the central government Universal Credit IT systems will not be ready on time,\" adds the Local Government Association, which represents councils.\nSo how does the government respond? Radio 4's The World This Weekend invited a minister to appear on the programme, but the invitation was declined.\nIn its evidence to the committee of MPs, the Department for Work and Pensions claims that \"digital skills are a factor in around 72% of jobs\", and so encouraging people to manage their Universal Credit online is sensible. It also saves a significant amount of money.\nAdvice will also be available, the department says, for those recipients who need help with managing their family budget.\n\"Rigorous, integrated IT testing has also commenced,\" it adds, pointing out it has \"some of the best contingency arrangements in place across government\" if things go wrong.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] When across the West the electoral pendulum swung reliably between parties of the centre left and centre right? There was consensus about the benefits of a global market economy. Politicians seemed to talk the same way, wear the same ties, parrot the same stale slogans.\nMeanwhile voters got on with shopping, and turning out at elections in ever decreasing numbers. This seemed to be the condition of liberal democracy at the start of 2016. But the seedbed for Brexit and Trump was there.\nAs politics became the preserve of a professional office-seeking class the old parties shrank. Popular indifference and distrust of politics grew. A few years ago the political scientist Peter Mair argued that Western democracy was being hollowed out.\nWith one referendum and a presidential election, liberal democracy as we've known it seems finally, dramatically, to have collapsed in on itself.\nToo hyperbolic? In response to Donald Trump's victory, the authoritarian, anti-immigration Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, said it was \"great news\" and claimed his victory marked the end of a period of \"liberal non-democracy\".\nThis is the same Viktor Orban who was greeted with a mock-Nazi salute by the president of the European Commission at a summit last year. \"The dictator is coming,\" quipped Jean-Claude Juncker. Now many Western leaders are sweating.\nLast month the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the West's political values were in danger of breaking down.\nWhat does he think those values are? \"Human rights, civil liberties, including the freedom of speech and religion, free market and a competitive economy based on private property, reasonable and fair redistribution of goods, restrictions on power resulting from rules and tradition, tolerance and political pluralism.\"\nMr Tusk said those who questioned liberal democracy were happy about Brexit, looked up to President Putin and supported Donald Trump.\nAnd it's true that from the coffee shops of Brooklyn to the bistros of Brussels there is a sense of melancholy and foreboding.\nFor people who have enjoyed the political stability and economic opportunities delivered by decades of liberal democracy these are bewildering, unsettling times.\n\"How\", they ask, \"can Britain possibly have voted to leave the EU?\" Millions of despairing Americans are grappling with the prospect of President Donald Trump. \"Is Le Pen next?\" they fret in the cafes of Paris.\nBut for voters who cast ballots for Brexit and Donald Trump it feels like politics has finally listened to them. The \"left behind\" economic narrative does not account for the full variety of forces behind this new populism.\nBut in the view of Parag Khanna, an American professor in Singapore and author of the new book Connectography, 2016 will be remembered as the year that \"the global underclass revolt crystallised in the form of the Brexit and the Trump election\".\n\"This uncoordinated movement really began with Occupy Wall Street and has now claimed its biggest scalp,\" he says.\nProf Vernon Bogdanor, at King's College London, agrees. \"There is a division between the exam-passing classes who are not hostile to the global elite and the left behind who are nationalist and protectionist,\" he says.\n\"It takes different forms in different countries but it's now a fairly common phenomenon in Europe and America.\"\nProf Bogdanor tells me the new political cleavage is not between left and right but between nationalist populism and those perceived as \"elites\". And he is worried.\n\"The election of Donald Trump is the most troubling political event in my lifetime. It's not difficult to arouse nationalist passions. We saw that in the 1930s. We're seeing a pale imitation of what we saw then\", he says, while careful to make clear he doesn't consider the president-elect a fascist.\nBut Claire Fox, the director of the Institute of Ideas, thinks the vitality of liberal democracy has been proved by the Brexit and Trump results. \"We have to be careful of an anti-democratic response to perfectly legitimate democratic votes. Quite a lot of liberals are saying, 'well, democracy is not working so well because people are voting in a way we don't want them to vote', which strikes me as a supreme irony.\"\nA suffocating political and cultural consensus has driven the backlash we are seeing now, she believes. \"There has been arguably far less tolerance over the last 10 years for anyone who doesn't agree with what a particular elite outlook is - and a silence or demonising of people who don't go along with the narrative.\"\nMs Fox cites public concern about immigration as a prime example and she also takes exception to the suggestion liberal democracy is being threatened by an ugly authoritarianism. \"The whole of the establishment, from army generals to big business, lined up to say Brexit was a mistake,\" she argues. \"What's authoritarian is employers turning round to their workers and saying jobs would be lost.\n\"We had an elite who thought they could call a referendum, mobilise everybody who should go and vote as they were told. That's caused a massive tantrum amongst the elite who then have the nerve to say it's the people's fault for threatening democracy.\"\nWhether or not this political upheaval should be celebrated or feared, it feels like a rupture with the past. We are rumbling over an important set of points with little idea where we are heading.\nBrexit and Trump promised political control to people who felt their lives had little of it, who were furious at the gulf between their political rulers and the governed and mourned the social cohesion of the past, and whose voices were not heard much in the media. In the raucous, angry echo chamber of social media a fight back brewed.\nThe flipside seems to be growing intolerance of pluralism and difference.\nThat is why people like Donald Tusk anxiously wonder how Western liberal democracy can respond and survive. Because there is nothing inevitable about its continuity.\nAs author and political philosopher John Gray wrote recently, plenty of authoritarian regimes in the world are doing well.\nThe middle class in Russia appears wedded to a combination of consumerism and nationalism and in China many want nothing more than rising living standards and freedom in their private lives. \"Liberal societies cannot depend on history for their survival,\" he says in a New Statesman article. \"They need to defend themselves.\"\nAt the moment however, the winners from globalisation and the political elites have lost and the dissenters have won.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Lib Dem MP John Pugh said Vince Cable should replace Mr Clegg after the party lost all but one of its 12 MEPs.\nThe MP told the BBC it was \"ludicrous\" to carry on as usual.\nBut Mr Clegg said he was proud of having taken on UKIP and \"stood up for the values that we believe in\", even though, he said, \"it didn't work\".\nAnd he got support from Mr Cable, the business secretary, who said: \"There is no leadership issue... now is not the time for infighting and introspection. The party must hold its nerve.\"\nThe Lib Dems got 6.9% of votes, down from 13.7% in 2009, leaving them in fifth place behind the Green Party, as they lost seats in every region apart from the South East of England.\nMr Clegg told the BBC: \"There are some individuals who say they want a change of leadership, a change of strategy, or who want to pull out of the coalition altogether. Of course it is right to have searching questions in the wake of such a bad set of election results.\n\"The easiest thing in politics, and sometimes in life, when the going gets really, really tough, is just to walk away, to wash your hands of it.\n\"I'm not going to do that and my party's not going to do that.\n\"The vast majority of Liberal Democrats do not believe that we should lose our nerve and walk away just now.\"\nThe election results had been a \"huge setback\", he said, but his party was \"the most united, resilient, toughest party in British politics\" and he was \"immensely proud\" of leading it.\n\"Uniquely in British politics, the Liberal Democrats decided to take on UKIP and argue for the things we believe in: a generous-hearted, open-minded, internationalist Britain,\" he said.\n\"It didn't work but it is right that we stood up for the values that we believe in.\"\nHe also defended the decision to enter coalition with the Conservatives, arguing that the Lib Dems had enabled the UK economy to recover while bringing about policies that were fair to people on low incomes.\nLib Dems expected to fare badly in the elections but party president Tim Farron has said its performance - coupled with the loss of 250 council seats in the local elections - was \"staggeringly disappointing\".\nMr Farron, Sir Menzies and Lord Ashdown - another former leader who is running the party's general election campaign - have defended Mr Clegg's leadership and appealed for party unity.\nBut Mr Pugh, the MP for Southport, said the party was underestimating the difficulties it was in and there was an \"overwhelming\" case for Mr Clegg's future to be discussed.\n\"We have just lost 72% of the council seats we were defending and 91% of the Euro seats,\" he said.\n\"The vast majority of the UK this morning is without Lib Dem representation at any level. If that does not prompt a serious, sharp review focussed view both of strategy and leadership, then whatever will!\n\"Orders just to press on regardless are genuinely of Somme-like insanity.\"\nMr Pugh said a \"section of the electorate\" was not listening to Mr Clegg and that his \"personal preference\" was for a \"Cable succession\".\nAny transition to a new leader must take place \"without aggravation or discord\", he told the BBC News Channel, and if the party decided to stick with Mr Clegg, he said he would \"knuckle\" down and accept it.\nAsked whether other MPs shared his views, he said. \"All MPs see the problem. What they don't all agree on is the solution.\"\nA third general election candidate, Helen Flynn, has called for Mr Clegg to stand down amid mumblings in the party which the BBC expects to increase during the day.\nMartin Tod, a member of the Liberal Democrats' federal executive, claimed voters were \"not prepared\" to listen to Mr Clegg and said his party's response to the election reversals had been \"complacent\".\nFormer MP Sandra Gidley, one of about 250 people to have signed an online letter demanding a change of leader, said Mr Clegg was \"associated with the broken promises of the coalition\".\nShe told the BBC's Today programme that a new leader would be able to better articulate the \"positive difference\" the party had made by working with the Conservatives.\nBut Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander, who has been touted as a future leader himself, insisted Mr Clegg was \"by far the best spokesman\" for the Lib Dems.\nSir Menzies said the Lib Dems had had to fight the election in a \"febrile\" eurosceptic climate.\n\"There's no doubt in my mind that Nick Clegg is the person with the courage and the resilience to take the party through to and during, and indeed after, the next general election.\"\nCatherine Bearder, the only Liberal Democrat MEP to be elected so far, said Mr Clegg had been right to go out and campaign on a positive EU platform.\n\"It's been very difficult,\" she told Sky News. \"We fought a very good, positive campaign on our issues of being in the European Union and standing up for Britain in the European Union.\"\nShe denied Mr Clegg or the EU as a whole had proved unpopular on the doorstep, but added: \"People don't understand how the European Union works and they don't think it is important to their daily lives.\"\nSome MPs have expressed reservations about the leadership of the party but none have yet called for Mr Clegg - who took over in 2007 - to stand down.\nAmong MEPs to lose their seats include veterans Sir Graham Watson, Andrew Duff and Bill Newton Dunn as well as Edward McMillan-Scott, an ex-Tory who was the only British vice-president of the European Parliament.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] But following a summer in which Arsene Wenger has already done some serious spending, the evidence is that the Gunners boss has not yet strengthened enough.\nThere are some positives: as with their last-gasp win over Crystal Palace last week, Saturday's fight-back from 2-0 down to draw against Everton was an indication that Arsenal now have the backbone they lacked when the going got tough last season.\nBut the fact they found themselves in so much trouble in the first place suggests some of their other old shortcomings have not been eradicated yet.\nWenger had vowed before kick-off at Goodison Park that his side would show they were not soft touches any more but they again found it difficult to cope when they faced a player with genuine physical power.\nEverton's Romelu Lukaku destroyed the Gunners in April and they could not live with him this time either, despite claims from his manager Roberto Martinez after the game that he was not fully fit.\nLukaku again stayed wide right to target and torment Arsenal left-back Nacho Monreal, and all three of Everton's front players - the big Belgian, his compatriot Kevin Mirallas on the right and Steven Naismith in the centre - looked dangerous running at the visitors.\nIn mitigation, this was a makeshift Gunners defence - their first-choice centre-back pairing of Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny are yet to play together this season, and Monreal is only playing because Kieran Gibbs is injured.\nCalum Chambers, who has started the season at centre-back, is a promising prospect but he is still learning his trade, as has been seen this week.\nChambers almost cost Arsenal a goal in the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Besiktas, diving in to try to clear and letting Demba Ba in on goal. He did not get away with it when he repeated that error in the build-up to Everton's second goal, after Mertesacker had been muscled off the ball.\nBut Arsenal's lack of strength in depth in that department is their own fault. Wenger sold their usual back-up centre-back - and occasional left-back - Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona the week before the season started, and he has not been replaced.\nThe Frenchman still has time to put that right before the transfer window shuts on 1 September, but the signs are he will choose to rely on the versatile but raw Chambers.\nFilling in when and where he is needed will be great for the 19-year-old's development, but not so good for Arsenal if further mistakes prove as costly.\nLast season, Arsenal's problems at the back started further up the pitch.\nThere was little protection given to their back-line in the damaging defeats they suffered at the homes of their rivals in the top five, including Everton.\nWorryingly for Wenger, the same was true on Saturday, when Mathieu Flamini was the only truly defensively minded man in their midfield.\nIn the first half, when the Toffees took the game to the Gunners, they found little resistance in that area, with their first goal a good example.\nGareth Barry was given time to pick out the perfect ball for the unmarked Seamus Coleman to open the scoring.\n\"I could not work out what Arsenal were doing defensively - it was poor,\" BBC football pundit Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day.\n\"It was a very good ball by Barry but Mesut Ozil should have stayed with Coleman, who was his man.\n\"That is not the only mistake, though. There was no pressure on Barry, and you cannot play offside when there is no pressure on the ball.\"\nThe Gunners have been linked with Real Madrid's Sami Khedira or Sporting's William Carvalho if they get past Besiktas on Wednesday and secure a place in the Champions League group stage.\nEither would make a big difference to plugging gaps of that sort.\nWenger spent Â£35m this summer to sign Alexis Sanchez, who was seen as a step-up from their existing first-choice frontman Olivier Giroud.\nSanchez might well still prove a striking superstar, but against Everton, on his own in attack and leading the line for the first time, he looked lightweight and lost.\n\"Arsenal had no presence up front,\" added Shearer. \"They had nobody to attack balls in the box. In the 45 minutes he played, Sanchez did not have one touch in the Everton area.\n\"That all changed, to be fair to Wenger, at half-time when he brought on Giroud. He did have a presence and Arsenal then had somebody who they could see in the box.\"\nBut what happens when there is no Giroud? Arsenal could find out again as soon as Wednesday in the second leg against Besiktas because the Frenchman injured his ankle in the closing minutes.\nJoel Campbell, who is unproven in the Premier League, and Yaya Sanogo, like Chambers a relative rookie, are their only other options.\nAnd, when you compare Arsenal's firepower to that of the teams who finished above them last season, it appears another definite weak link.\nA perfect fit would be a striker with the pace and mobility Giroud lacks, but also the sort of physical presence Sanchez does not possess.\nThe question is, with Wenger talking after the Everton game about having \"more strikers than before\", is he even looking for another one? He should be.\nIn each of their three games in the Premier League and Champions League so far this season, Arsenal have been unimpressive. Crucially, though, they have also been unbeaten.\n\"Very much like last week against Palace, Arsenal did not play well for the vast majority of the game against Everton, but they kept on going until the end and got the three points,\" said Shearer.\n\"This week they kept on going until the end and got one point. It was not a very good performance but it is a good sign.\"\nUnderstandably, after his side had scored two goals in the last seven minutes to get an unlikely draw, Wenger also pointed to their \"fantastic spirit\" and \"complete desire\".\n\"When we got beaten here 3-0 last season, it could have been many more,\" Wenger explained. \"Three was quite flattering on the day.\n\"For us to come back from 2-0 down this time against a team as good on the counter-attack shows the belief and the resilience was there.\"\nIn truth, 'resilience' was what Arsenal had been noticeably short of when they were under the cosh in the first half.\nYes, Everton's second goal was offside, but the Toffees were completely dominant and but for a bad miss by Kevin Mirallas, could have been out of sight by half-time.\nWhat Arsenal actually had, as well as belief, was the ability to rescue something from a game that looked lost, but turned as Everton tired.\nWenger is right to take encouragement from their comeback, and also correct that they probably would not have managed to dig themselves out of a similar-sized hole in the past.\nBut there is a danger that, in weighing up whether to strengthen his squad in the next few days, he ignores the longstanding problems that mean they needed to.\nPerhaps he should remember that not every top team will offer them a second chance.\n [OUT] ",

Count his assists during the course of the season and it won't be a millions miles off his goals tally.\nThere was a negative here, though. He got booked for diving - and rightly so.

The striker had no need to do it.\nThere's a far greater speed of thought in Celtic's attack. Their second goal came from a turnover in midfield.\nCeltic came alive in those moments and Saints - terribly weakened by the loss of injured defenders - were a confused mess at the back.\nPoor Alan Mannus made two fine saves in the midst of this rapid Celtic attack, first from Forrest and then Griffiths. He couldn't make a third. Sinclair put it away.\nWhat a dangerous attack Celtic have now.

Unbelievably, they were now hanging on.\nSt Johnstone boss Tommy Wright went for the equaliser, going 3-4-3 at the end, but it backfired when Christie drilled in the fourth.\nSaints' mettle is beyond question, as is Celtic's capacity to construct goal mountains.\nSt Johnstone boss Tommy Wright: \"There is no doubt Celtic were excellent, particularly first half, but we contributed to that.\n\"The three goals were all poor goals from our point of view. We gave the ball away cheaply on the halfway line, we don't win the second ball in midfield, something we are brilliant at, and the third goal...we should deal with the problem on the halfway line and we don't.\n\"That's not taking away anything from Celtic, they were magnificent.

The government denies the accusation.\nA spokesman for Mr Putin, currently Russian prime minister, later said that \"the majority of the population\" supported him, describing the protesters as a minority.\nIn a BBC interview, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was confident that Mr Putin would win the presidential elections in March, saying he was \"beyond the competition\".\nOn Saturday, a sea of demonstrators stretched along Sakharov Avenue, a few miles from the Kremlin, in sub-zero temperatures.\nRallies were taking place across Russia, with the first big protest in the far eastern city of Vladivostok.\nAt least 28,000 people turned out in the capital, according to the Russian interior ministry, but rally organisers said the true number was around 120,000.\nPresident Dmitry Medvedev announced political reforms this week, but many demonstrators say it is not enough.\nThey are demanding a re-run of the poll, which was won by Vladimir Putin's party - but with a much smaller share of the overall vote.\nMr Putin poured scorn on protesters during a recent live chat on Russian TV, calling them \"Banderlog\" after the lawless monkeys in The Jungle Book, and likening their protest symbol, a white ribbon, to a condom.\nHowever he also said protesters had the right to demonstrate if they kept within the law.\nIn Moscow, many protesters clutched white balloons and banners with the slogan \"For Free Elections\" while some mocked Mr Putin with images of condoms, to the extent that the first speaker, music journalist Artyom Troitsky, dressed himself up as one.\nBy Daniel SandfordBBC News, Moscow\nSo the 24 December protesters have headed home again, after a day on the streets in which the temperature never got above zero. But they have promised to be back. There are already plans for another demonstration in the New Year.\nThe big question before today was whether they could maintain their momentum, and the answer this afternoon was a resounding \"yes\".\nBy the time everyone returns from the long Russian New Year and Christmas holidays it will be less than two months to the presidential elections.\nVladimir Putin is still the favourite, but his supporters around Russia will find it much harder to operate in the current political climate; and harder to cheat, if that is what they have done in the past.\nWe saw grandmothers and grandfathers, Moscow hipsters, and schoolchildren on the rally today. They do not speak for all of Russia, they may not even speak for the majority.\nBut they now know that they have some power, and many of them intend to go on using it to get fairer elections.\nThe resolution passed at Saturday's rally built on demands expressed at an earlier rally in Moscow on 10 December.\nAnother new point was a call for the creation of a new election monitoring body - the Moscow Voters' Association - to investigate ballot-rigging.\nMr Navalny, a prominent anti-corruption blogger who was jailed for 15 days over a street protest just after the elections, greeted the crowd with the words \"Greetings to the Banderlog from the net hamsters [internet activists]\".\nCondemning Russia's leaders as \"swindlers and thieves\", he listed victims of injustice including imprisoned former tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and anti-corruption lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in custody.\n\"Who's the power here?\" he shouted to cries of \"We are\" from the crowd.\nHe promised that the next protest rally would be a \"million strong\".\nAlexei Kudrin, who recently resigned after serving a decade as Mr Putin's finance minister, was booed when he took the microphone to call for early parliamentary elections and urge a dialogue between the Kremlin and the opposition.\n\"There needs to be a platform for dialogue, otherwise there will be a revolution and we lose the chance that we have today for a peaceful transformation,\" he said.\nA total of 22 speakers were lined up for the Moscow rally, with rival opposition figures addressing a crowd which mixed liberals with nationalists.\nSaturday's rally in Moscow ended peacefully, with the last speaker a Grandfather Frost (Russian Santa Claus) figure who wished citizens of a \"free Russia\" a Happy New Year.\n\"People were scared before the first big demonstration on 10 December,\" protester Andrei Luzhin told AFP news agency.\n\"Now they no longer have fear.\"\nSome 50,000 people rallied on 10 December, in what was then the biggest anti-government protest since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nOn Thursday, Mr Medvedev proposed to hold direct elections of regional governors and simplify the procedure for registering political parties, but protesters say the concessions do not go far enough, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says.\nHowever, one of the main problems for the opposition is that there is no single leader able to unite it, our correspondent adds.\nRallies against ballot-rigging were reported across Russia's time zones, though none were on the same scale as that in Moscow.\n [OUT] ",

He said very clearly that he didn't believe it was in the national interest, and the two companies needed to address security concerns.\nNow he says those concerns haven't been addressed, and that's why he's shut the deal down.\nThat seems - on the surface at least - perfectly logical. But the Chinese, who have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the way they are being treated, are unlikely to see this as more protectionism from Australia.\nEarlier this year, Australia blocked the sale of Kidman & Co - the world's biggest cattle farm - to a Chinese investor.\nHowever, Mr Morrison said that the plans to privatise Ausgrid remained in place, aimed at helping the New South Wales state government to raise capital for local infrastructure projects.\nAustralia's decision comes in the wake of the UK government's decision, under new Prime Minister Theresa May, to review the building of a nuclear plant partly funded by China.\n\"In their quest for global reach, Chinese firms have been acquiring significant stakes in international energy companies especially in emerging and developing countries,\" said Prof Kamel Mellahi of Warwick Business School.\n\"But in the future firms may ask themselves the question whether the deal would go through just because the investor is from China. That said, such decisions will have little or no effects on Chinese investment in non-critical sectors.\"\nChina's ambassador to the UK warned that the delay to approving the plant had brought the two countries to a \"crucial historical juncture\".\n [OUT] ",

Some clubs also offer sessions that are more fitness-based than actual boxing.\nThe US-based Centres for Disease Control Prevention reported that boxing provided the best mixture of exercise for people whose goal is to decrease their risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis and cancer.\nTraining sessions are an excellent way to develop communication skills and learn to work effectively with other people.

Boxers score points for every punch they land successfully on their opponent's head or upper body.\nFive judges score each bout, and a boxer scores a point when they deliver a blow that, without being blocked or guarded, lands directly with the knuckle part of the closed glove of either hand on any part of the front or sides of the head or body above the belt.\nGet your performance under pressure analysed in just 20 minutes by four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson\nStart the experiment\nThe scores in each round are the average of a combination of the three judges' scores which are the closest (called 'Similar Score').\nThe boxer with the most points wins the bout, but if a boxer cannot get up after 10 seconds it is classed as a knockout and the bout is over.\nWarnings can be applied in each round. When warnings are applied to a boxer, two points are awarded to his/her opponent.\nA referee can also stop the fight for a disqualification or if they feel one athlete is not in a fit state to continue.\nIn case of a draw of the final scores, the lowest and highest total scores from the judges will be deleted. The winner will be determined by the total score from the three remaining judges.\nIf the scores are still tied, judges will be asked to press the button once for the boxer they think is the winner. The decision is made by taking the majority of the five judges.\nIf both boxers are disqualified there will be no winner. The bout could be declared 'no contest' due to a technical incident beyond the responsibility of the boxers.\nIn the men's, boxers compete in bouts of three rounds, each lasting three minutes, with a one-minute rest period between rounds.\nIn the women's, boxers compete in bouts of four rounds, each lasting two minutes, with a one-minute rest period between rounds.\nMore on the Team GB website\nTeam GB stand a good chance of medalling in both the men's and women's competition.\nFour of the seven men selected medalled at the 2011 World Championship, with silvers for Andrew Selby,Anthony Joshua and Luke Campbell.\nThe women's trio are highly fancied following the World Championship in May, when middleweight Savannah Marshall won gold and Nicola Adams silver and Natasha Jonas bronze.\nUkraine's men's team won four golds at the 2011 World Championship.

The 18-year-old won a unanimous decision over Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of Poland.\nBoxing was one of the cornerstones of the ancient Olympic Games in Greece from the 23rd Olympiad in 688BC. Pugilism, as the Greeks called it, prohibited clinching and had no weight classes, rounds or time limit.\nBoxing wasn't on the itinerary of ancient Olympic sports that made up the first modern Games in 1896 as it was considered \"ungentlemanly, dangerous and practised by the dregs of society\".\nThings have moved on considerably since boxing was introduced to the ancient Olympic Games in the 7th century BC, and even in the 108 years since the sport made its Olympic debut there have been major changes, such as headguards being made mandatory in 1984 and electronic scoring arriving in 1992.\nHowever, none of those can match the significance of the three women's events -  flyweight, lightweight and middleweight - scheduled for introduction in London.\nMore on the IOC website\n [OUT] ",

Haqqani served as a cabinet minister under the Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Omar.\nThe Haqqani network was one of several militant groups that operated from the tribal areas along the Afghan-Pakistan border following the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, which began in 2001.\nBBC regional analyst Charles Haviland says Jalaluddin Haqqani turned against the West with a vengeance, allowing his base in Pakistan to be used by militants who inflicted huge casualties in Afghanistan, including among Western troops.\nAs the Haqqanis grew in strength, Pakistan's security establishment was accused of secretly supporting the group, although it has strongly denied this.\nAnalysts say the network has always been part of the Taliban and its members accepted Mullah Omar as their leader.\nOn Thursday the Taliban said they had appointed their deputy leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, as successor to Mullah Omar.\nCorrespondents say the move is likely to divide the group and that many senior figures opposed the appointment.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] A colony of stromatolites - tiny structures made by primitive blue-green algae.\nStromatolites are the oldest known fossils in the world.\nThe tiny algae or bacteria that build them are also thought to be the most ancient life form that is still around today, after more than three billion years.\nWhat makes the discovery in Northern Ireland so remarkable is that until now these structures have been found mainly in warm and often hyper saline waters which discourage predators.\nThe stromatolites in the Giant's Causeway are in a tiny brackish pool, exposed to the violence of waves and easy prey to the animals that are already living amongst them.\nStromatolites are formed by blue-green algae that excrete carbonate to form a dome-like structure. Over thousands of years these build up into a hard rock that continues to grow.\nStromatolite fossils have been dated as far back as three and a half billion years.\nThe colony at the Giant's Causeway on Northern Ireland's wind-swept north coast was found by accident.\nScientists from the School of Environmental Sciences at the nearby University of Ulster were looking for very different geological formations when Professor Andrew Cooper spotted the stromatolites.\n\"I was very surprised\", explained Professor Cooper.\n\"I was walking along with a colleague looking at something else. Out of the corner of my eye I spotted these structures which, had I not seen them before in my work in South Africa, I probably wouldn't have known what they were.\"\nThe colony is very young, just a layer thick, so it's recently formed. One thing that is puzzling scientists is why its chosen this spot.\n\"There is some unusual set of circumstances that occurs just here that doesn't occur even 10 metres away along the beach,\" said Professor Cooper.\n\"So whatever it is, it's very special to this particular time and space.\"\nOne clue could be the myriad of shells in the grass banks just about the tiny pool. Rain water is leaching through the ground and the shells, dissolving out calcium carbonate and carrying to the stromatolites.\nThe blue-green algae that form the stromatolites helped create our present atmosphere by breaking down carbon dioxide and excreting oxygen. Their appearance on this planet is seen as a turning point in the earth's evolution.\nWhile living examples are thought to be rare, it could be that we haven't found them because we aren't looking for them.\n\"The chances are that they may be more widespread than we actually know\", explained Professor Cooper.\n\"Geologists have spent a lot more time studying the ancient stromatolites that are two billion years old than we have spent on living stromatolites.\n\"So this is an important site where we can look at the circumstances in which stromatolites actually occur.\"\nNews of the find is only starting to leak out but its expected to start a frenzied search around the coast of Ireland to see if there is more of this primitive organism to be discovered.\n [OUT] ",

More than 1,600 new migrants have reached the islands in the 36 hours since the measures came into effect on Sunday, officials say.\n\"If there is no reduction in the flow [of refugees], we will not be able to evacuate the islands successfully so the deal can start to be fully implemented,'' Mr Tsipras warned.\nThe arrival of the 10 Turkish monitors has aroused some political opposition in Greece. They will stay on the islands for a week.\nMeanwhile, 2,300 EU experts, including security and migration officials and translators, have not yet arrived to help enforce the plan. Officials have said the returns to Turkey are unlikely to start before 4 April.\nUnder the deal, no new migrant arrivals will be allowed to travel to the Greek mainland.\nAnyone who does not apply for asylum will be sent back, as will anyone whose claim is rejected. For every Syrian migrant sent back to Turkey, one Syrian already in Turkey will be resettled in the EU.\nThere are also questions about what will happen to the tens of thousands of migrants still stuck in Greece and on its closed border with Macedonia, as their route north has been blocked.\nBoats carrying some 2,000 irregular migrants from the islands docked near Athens on Monday.\nThe Turkey-EU statement in full\nMore than 144,000 irregular migrants have arrived this year alone, and about 460 have died, according to the International Organization for Migration.\nCritics have said the deal could force migrants to start using other, potentially more dangerous routes, such as the journey between North Africa and Italy.\nIn the hours before the plan came into force, hundreds of people were rescued by Italian and Libyan officials amid an increase in traffic through the Strait of Sicily.\nAnd in Turkey, at least 200 people were caught in a coastal town and turned back as they tried to reach Greece ahead of the deadline, authorities said.\nHuman rights groups have strongly criticised the deal, with Amnesty International accusing the EU of turning \"its back on a global refugee crisis\".\nMost of the migrants arriving in Europe are keen to go to Germany and other northern countries, which have seen increasing public discontent with the influx.\nBavarian finance minister Markus Soeder - a member of the sister party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU, the Christian Social Union - has said the deal could lead to a mass migration of Kurds to Germany, as the agreement gives Turks visa-free travel rights.\n\"It could ultimately lead to more immigration, especially if you take visa freedom into account. Many, many Kurds fleeing the Turkish government could come to Germany,\" Mr Soeder told German public broadcaster ZDF.\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.\n [OUT] ",

Fruit bats, which are a delicacy in the worst affected south-eastern region, are thought to be carriers of the disease.\nHealth Minister Remy Lamah said the virus appeared to have been transmitted by an man who showed symptoms of haemorrhagic fever after visiting Dinguiraye in central Guinea, far from the identified outbreaks of Ebola in the remote south-east.\nFour of the man's brothers, who attended his funeral in the central town of Dabola, started to show the same symptoms and were tested for Ebola on their return to Conakry.\nThe four have been placed in an isolation ward and the dead man's family have also been quarantined, the minister said.\nThe spread of the disease to Conakry, a city of some two million people, marks an escalation in the Ebola outbreak in Guinea - one of the poorest nations on earth, despite rich deposits of bauxite and iron ore.\nDiscovered in 1976 after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, then Zaire, Ebola causes a severe haemorrhagic fever where victims suffer vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding.\nScientists have yet to develop an effective drug or vaccine to fight it.\nPart of the problem is that the deadly virus is rare and its victims are often poor people living in rural areas of Africa without well-functioning health systems. But there is also little incentive for major pharmaceutical companies to invest in medical solutions when there is little chance of a return, analysts say.\nHowever, many health officials believe the virus could be better controlled with good basic hygiene and the eradication of dangerous bush meat consumption. The US government also funds some research, partly out of concern the virus could be used for bioterrorism.\n\"Ebola virus is one of the deadliest killers known,\" said Ben Neuman, a virologist at Britain's University of Reading.\n\"If this virus spread between people more easily, it would probably be more deadly than the black plague. Fortunately, up to this point, it has not,\" he added.\nOutbreaks of Ebola occur primarily in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests, the World Health Organization says.\n [OUT] ",

If Liverpool beat Newcastle United at Anfield on Monday they will close to within four points.\nIrrespective of how this season ends, City's ageing squad is in need of a serious overhaul and speculation continues to surround the future of manager Manuel Pellegrini.\nSo who should be in or out at the Etihad next season?\nAge: 33; Signed: 2014 (Â£6m); Appearances: 2\nCaballero was very much Manuel Pellegrini's man as a signing to understudy Joe Hart, having had him at Malaga. The Argentine keeper is unlikely to see a great deal of active service barring injury - so could make the cut as a dependable second in line to Hart.\nVerdict: May get another season\nDid you know? Caballero conceded two goals in each of his two appearances yet still ended up on the winning side in both games (Sunderland and Hull).\nAge: 27; Signed: 2006 (Â£500,000); Appearances: 30\nNot at his best against Manchester United but England's goalkeeper has maintained his form this season while others around him have lost theirs.\nIf, as expected, City reconstruct their squad this summer, Hart will surely remain as a centrepiece in the future.\nVerdict: Certain to stay\nDid you know? Hart has played more minutes in the league (2,700) than any other player in the City squad this season.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2011 (Â£7m); Appearances: 23; Goals: 1\nOnce a fine player with a good attitude but past his best and City need to do better at left-back if they are to reboot and challenge for major honours next season.\nVerdict: Fine as a deputy but not first choice. Could be the summer to make a change.\nDid you know? Clichy has the best success rate of anyone to make 50-plus tackles at City this season, 81%.\nAge: 34; Signed: 2013 (Â£4.2m); Appearances: 25; Goals: 1\nMuch derided at the start of his City career but has been their best defender this season - age may count against him if they decide to give an ageing squad a fresh look.\nVerdict: Done well for City and no hurry to rush him out of the door but hardly a long-term bet.\nDid you know? Demichelis has made a team-high 131 clearances in 2014-15.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2010 (Â£19m); Appearances: 15; Goals: 0\nNow very much a peripheral figure and hard to see how he would seriously play a part in any long-term strategy.\nVerdict: Time to go.\nDid you know? Kolarov is yet to score a goal this season, he has scored at least one in each of his previous four campaigns with City.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2008 (Â£6m); Appearances: 23; Goals: 0\nThe club's inspirational leader and captain has had a poor season punctuated by injuries and loss of form that has revealed a vulnerability that has not been in evidence before.\nKompany, however, may benefit from a summer without football following a hectic schedule, including the World Cup, and City will hope a period of rest can restore some of his old powers.\nVerdict: Too early to call time on a quality defender and personality. Will still be around next season.\nDid you know? Kompany has been booked more often (seven times) than any other City player this season.\nAge: 24; Signed: 2014 (Â£32m); Appearances: 19; Goals: 0\nDesperate disappointment after his Â£32m move from Porto. The central defender has looked ill-at-ease and unsuited to the rigours of the Premier League - one of the signings who pose questions over those making the transfer decisions at the Etihad.\nVerdict: Does not look up to the job and cutting losses could be wise but who would take him at anywhere near a price City might accept so soon after paying such an astronomical fee?\nDid you know? Mangala has completed 94% of his passes in his own half this season, the best rate by any City defender.\nAge: 32; Signed: 2014 (Free); Appearances: 9; Goals: 0\nSagna is nearer the end of his career than the start and is on a three-year deal after making a free transfer move from Arsenal. He has been trusted by Pellegrini in many of City's big games in the Champions League but younger options may be sought.\nUnlikely to be a regular next season but could still be of use - and would he get a better deal elsewhere?\nVerdict: Hardly one for the future but could survive as a squad player.\nDid you know? Sagna has made just nine Premier League appearances in his debut season with City, winning just four of those games.\nAge: 30; Signed: 2008 (Â£6.5m); Appearances: 23; Goals: 1\nNot a vintage year for the Argentine right-back who has been one of City's outstanding performers in recent years and is a hugely popular figure with their fans.\nZabaleta is made of stern stuff and will be determined to put matters right next season and prove he has not passed his peak.\nVerdict: In the same category as Kompany. He has been of such importance to City in their years of success that it would be rash to cast him aside after one indifferent season.\nDid you know? Zabaleta is the only outfield player for City to make more than five appearances and not be either subbed on or off this season.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2013 (Â£30m); Appearances: 27; Goals: 2\nNot a spectacular player but reliable and certainly counts as someone worth having around in the squad. May not be so effective against the truly top-class European opposition but worth keeping.\nVerdict: Should still be part of plans next season.\nDid you know?

Looks sluggish and seems to be allergic to a forward pass. What has he brought - or was meant to bring - to City's team? This is a question that has not been answered.\nVerdict: Out if a buyer can be found.\nDid you know? Fernando has a 62% win rate this season, but when he has not played City have a 46% win rate, winning just 5 of 11 when he has not featured.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2010 (Â£26m); Appearances: 27; Goals: 3\nExcellent, under-rated player but could well be on his way out at Manchester City after no deal has been agreed on a new contract. A manager's dream and there will be no shortage of takers should he move on.\nVerdict: Should be kept - but looks increasingly like he will not be.\nDid you know? Milner has been involved in nine goals this season, a personal record for him at City in a Premier League campaign.\nAge: 27; Signed: 2011 (Â£24m); Appearances: 22; Goals: 2\nThe odd contribution apart, this has been a season of under-achievement for a gifted individual who should contribute so much more than he does. This has mirrored City's season and it may be patience has run out.\nVerdict: Served his purpose at City and would not be a huge loss if a good fee can be recouped.\nDid you know? City have had a 59% win rate when Nasri has played this season but just 50% when he has been absent.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2013 (Â£14.9m); Appearances: 30; Goals: 0\nHighly prized on arrival from Sevilla but has failed to deliver on his promise. The statistic of 30 Premier League appearances this season and no goals is damning.\nVerdict: Could be in danger if the right offer comes in. Now 29 and will not get any better.\nDid you know? Navas has made a team-high seven assists this season in the league.\nAge: 31; Signed: 2010 (Â£24m); Appearances: 24; Goals: 8\nThe big dilemma - the driving force behind City's years of success but has looked laboured, jaded and occasionally disconnected this season. He has looked a shadow of his former self.\nHe has also failed to impose himself when City have needed him. No-one should ever under-estimate what he has done for City but the time comes for everyone and it may have come for Toure.\nVerdict: If a club such as Inter Milan offer a decent deal, time to sell and move on.\nDid you know? Toure has made more touches (2,456) than any other player in the squad this season, ranking fifth league-wide in this category.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2010 (Â£26m); Appearances: 26; Goals: 11\nMaybe not quite touched the previous heights this season but still a magical footballer capable of making decisive contributions. A player and personality who has graced the Premier League and will continue to do so.\nVerdict: Staying.\nDid you know? Silva has created 77 goalscoring chances for his team-mates this year, the most at City and only Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas have created more in the entire league.\nAge: 26; Signed: 2011 (Â£38m); Appearances: 27; Goals: 19\nWorld-class, despite a failure to produce his very best after picking up a knee injury in December - something that hit City hard.\nAguero is as close to a guarantee of Premier League goals as you can get and is crucial to everything City want to achieve.\nVerdict: Indispensable. Irreplaceable.\nDid you know? Aguero has attempted more shots (93) than any other player in the league this season.\nAge: 26; Signed: 2015 (Â£28m); Appearances: 5; Goals: 1\nBrought from Swansea City to give Manchester City extra cutting edge but has made a slow start then picked up an injury. He has, however, proved his Premier League pedigree and City will expect to see his best next season.\nVerdict: Part of the future.\nDid you know? Bony has played just 219 minutes for City this season, making just two starts and not completing 90 minutes once.\nAge: 29; Signed: 2011 (Â£27m); Appearances: 21; Goals: 4\nMiserable season for the Bosnian whose goals did so much to bring the title to Manchester City - just four in 21 Premier League games reflects his poor form.\nThe decision to bring in Bony for Â£25m from Swansea City was perhaps an admission of Dzeko's decline and reduced impact. Evidence suggests City have had his best years.\nVerdict: May just have outlived his usefulness at the Etihad.\nDid you know? Dzeko has just four goals so far this season in 21 appearances, his last three seasons saw him score 16, 14 and 14 goals respectively.\nAge: 25; Signed: 2013 (Â£22m); Appearances: 17; Goals: 5\nHe is a gifted Montenegrin who has shown quality in flashes but nowhere near often enough. Lacks consistency and is another big buy who has to be classed as a failure.\nVerdict: On his way out.\nDid you know? Jovetic has been involved in a goal every 98 minutes for City (five goals, three assists, 787 mins), only Aguero and Frank Lampard have a better goal involvement rate for the club.\nA season of disappointment for the manager who brought the Premier League and League Cup to Manchester City in his first season - which means speculation about his future is now inevitable.\nIf City, as is still a prospect, finish outside the top four then it is impossible to see how he can survive after such investment in his squad.\nAnd if City could somehow lure Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola to the Etihad he would also be in peril - no huge appetite for change as yet but his prospects were not helped by the manner of City's capitulation against Manchester United.\nVerdict: On thin ice. Uncertain times.\nOperating on a money-no-object wish list, here are three players Manchester City might love to add to their squad.\nThe brilliant France midfielder is the one who got away from Manchester United - and it could take Â£60m to prise the 22-year-old away from Juventus.\nPowerful, skilful and driven, he would be the perfect addition to a City midfield that has looked pedestrian this season.\nComplication: If Juve show any inclination to sell, an orderly queue will form, probably including Real Madrid and possibly even Manchester United.\nJust the sort of young English statement signing that Pellegrini says City are looking to make. He would add pace to City's attack and be a creative force.\nComplication: Despite an increasingly messy and public contract impasse, Liverpool insist he will not be sold this summer.\nAnd when Liverpool owner John W Henry said the same with Luis Suarez in 2013, he was true to his word.\nThe sort of signing that would tell the football world Manchester City mean business. For all his supposed struggles at the Bernabeu, a world-class talent.\nComplication - Real insist he will not be sold and Bale has expressed no wish to leave but things change by the hour at the Bernabeu.\nAlso Bale has constantly been linked with Manchester United should he return to the Premier League. Chelsea would also show an interest but City could match any financially.\nAll appearance stats are from the 2014-15 Premier League season\n [OUT] ",

Not an unusual step in the country with the highest school dropout rate in the EU.\nAs Spain prepares to vote on 20 December, in one of the most significant general elections in decades, education has become a key issue for the three parties topping the opinion polls.\nLast year, 21.9% of people aged 20-24 were early school leavers, compared with an EU average of 11.1%.\n\"I was a good student but I lost the motivation and I wanted to get some money quickly,\" Angel tells me when we meet in a cafe in the city of Murcia. \"Maybe it was because all my friends left school too?\"\nIt was 2009 and Spain was in the throes of the global economic crisis, with the school dropout rate reaching nearly 31%.\nTwo years later, the conservative opposition, the Popular Party (PP), swept to power. Angel himself voted Socialist, following a family tradition.\nNow he is 26 and learning again, enrolled in vocational training. He studies international commerce, transport and logistics, focusing on a career and future where he can move out of his parents' home, get married and have a child - two if they can afford it.\nHis girlfriend, Cristina Fernandez Gurrado, 25, has also been doing vocational training. She works in a kindergarten, a step on her way to a teaching degree.\nLike Angel, she still lives at home, unable to afford the Ã¢âÂ¬350 (ÃÂ£252; $381) a flat would cost her to rent, on her monthly pay of Ã¢âÂ¬400.\nPopular Party: \"Education, the path of opportunities\", 2nd place in manifesto behind job creation\nSocialists: \"Towards a Spain of knowledge\", 1st place in manifesto\nCitizens (Ciudadanos): \"A national pact for education\", 3rd place in manifesto behind democratic reform and the economy\nPodemos: 30th place in manifesto, with a switch to renewable energy in 1st place\nThis week the BBC will be reporting from across Spain on the issues affecting voters, from Murcia in the south to Castile and Leon and Catalonia in the north.\nBright and confident, Angel and Cristina are busy bettering themselves in a society where, Cristina says, those without a university degree are often underrated.\nPerhaps that is especially the case in Murcia, a student city with one of the oldest and most famous universities in Spain.\nStrikingly, education seems to be an issue for more people in Murcia than anywhere else in Spain.\nAn EU survey of public opinion conducted in September suggests that, for 28% of the region's population, the educational system ranks only below unemployment as their chief concern - the highest level among all of Spain's regions.\nThis anxiety comes across in different ways in Murcia, from discontent over how college grants are allocated (there is no overall national scheme for student loans like in the UK, for instance) to lack of discipline in classrooms.\nHusai de Leon y Salvador, 36, a former Spanish Navy sailor who manages a popular cafe in Cartagena, Murcia's naval port, believes the quality of secondary education has dropped since he was at school in the 1990s.\n\"I think the curriculum is incomplete,\" he tells me. \"It's too easy. It's education for dummies which doesn't teach children to think for themselves.\n\"Ask children about the history of their country, of an ancient city like Cartagena that gave the world the first electric-powered submarine, and they know nothing.\"\nAccording to Cristina, teachers lack authority in the classroom where many children come from homes with unemployed parents.\n\"The children have nothing to do and they protest in the schools all the time,\" she says.\nFor Diego Marin Romera, the local director of Euro Accion, which works with young people who have dropped out of school, poverty and violence are among the factors driving children to leave school early. Teachers often tell him such pupils \"really don't want to do anything at all\".\nHe believes more should be done to improve children's emotional engagement but the idea is taboo in Spain and schools rarely have more than one counsellor to 1,000 pupils.\n\"I don't think it's just about changing this subject for that, it's about seeing how the children are living.\"\n\"Leaving school early has, I think, a great impact on how young people view politics and the destiny of their country,\" Diego says.\n\"You cannot be aware of the importance of the simple act of voting when you do not have appropriate education, when you are not aware of the consequences of your acts.\"\nPolitical emotion is high in the city of Murcia ahead of the election. On one street you will find shredded PP posters littering the pavement while on another posters for new parties like Citizens (Ciudadanos) and Podemos are trampled underfoot.\nLocal elections in May badly hit the PP, for decades Murcia's dominant party, but it managed to cling on to power both in the regional government and on the city council, as minority administrations.\nHowever, in the region's second city, Cartagena, they were ejected by an alliance between the Socialists and a local good governance movement.\nHusai cast a blank vote in 2010 but this year he voted for Citizens, the new liberal, pro-business party which is now Murcia's fourth political force, behind the Socialists and Podemos.\n\"At this moment, the two big parties, the PP and the Socialists, are obsolete for me and the other option [Podemos] seem to believe in utopia,\" he says. \"I think Ciudadanos have their feet on the ground.\"\nIn the city of Murcia, Cristina also plans to vote Citizens, attracted by a manifesto promise to shake up education by introducing regular evaluations for teachers.\nFor her, part of the problem with education in Spain is that teaching is regarded as a \"job for life\".\nAngel is yet to decide how he will vote. Some of the PP's ideas for economic growth appeal to him but right now he is looking at either Citizens or Podemos - the anti-capitalist party that Cristina finds too \"unrealistic\".\n\"Ciudadanos and Podemos bring new ideas,\" he says. \"So the PP and the Socialists are having somehow to rebuild themselves with new ideas and methods to win back voters.\"\nThe man who left school at 15 seems very happy to watch Spain's political class going back to the classroom itself.\nFor more on Patrick's reports, follow him on Twitter.\n [OUT] ",

A stent, for example, might be squashed into a small space and then spring into its designed shape to prop open a blood vessel.\nBut the alloys have never entirely fulfilled their promise and entered the world of \"high cycle fatigue\" applications.\n\"Usually shape memory alloys - like in minimally invasive surgery - they regain their shape once, or a few times, but not multiple times,\" explained Prof Manfred Wuttig, one of the new paper's senior authors, from the University of Maryland in the US.\n\"This is highly unusual. It's kind of a leap forward,\" he told the BBC.\nProf Wuttig developed the new alloy with colleagues at the University of Kiel, in Germany.\nThe key to its remarkable properties is the way it is crystallised. The nickel, titanium and copper atoms are arranged in such a way that they can switch between two different configurations - again and again and again.\nThis \"phase transition\" is what causes the alloy to snap back into shape after it is bent. It can be triggered by heat, or, in a different form of the alloy, it can happen as soon as the tension is released.\nIn particular, the team reported it was tiny particles of an impurity - a chemical formed by titanium and copper, Ti2Cu - that smoothed out the switching process.\n\"This particular precipitate is fully compatible with both crystal structures, so it sort of assures that they fully transform from A to B and back again,\" Prof Wuttig said.\nThe team made the alloy in tiny 1cm-square pieces, much less than 1mm thick, and tested it using both heat and stress.\nTo rack up 10 million cycles took some patience and some automation, Prof Wuttig said.\n\"With stress it's not so difficult. You can buy [or build] little stress-strain machines... So you can automate that and then it's not so difficult. But it takes in the order of weeks to generate the number of cycles.\n\"It's much more difficult with temperature.\"\nThe team used a specialised furnace system to rapidly heat and cool the samples a full 10 million times.\n\"Again, it took a few weeks to conduct the experiment,\" Prof Wuttig said.\nThey examined the changes in the alloy's structure using powerful microscopes, as well as X-rays.\n\"We did experiments in a synchrotron, where the X-rays would tell us exactly what the crystal structures are,\" Prof Wuttig explained.\nIn a comment article for the journal, Prof Richard James described the attainment of 10 million cycles as \"breathtaking\". Prof James, from the University of Minnesota, was involved in the previous development of a memory alloy that withstood some 16,000 cycles.\nThe research was also applauded by Prof John Huber, a materials engineer at the University of Oxford.\n\"It's a significant find,\" he told BBC News.\n\"Normal shape memory alloys show quite significant changes in their properties, over quite a small number of cycles. The properties decay away.\n\"[Ten million] is what you start to need for cyclic applications - it gets you into the high cycle fatigue regime. That opens up potentially quite a lot of applications.\"\nProf Huber said the properties might prove useful in the wing flaps or \"control surfaces\" of aircraft, or the unfolding solar panels of a spacecraft, as well as artificial heart valves.\nProf Wuttig and his colleagues are particularly interested in refrigeration.\n\"Your refrigerator has a compressor. It compresses and expands a liquid that goes through phase transition,\" Prof Wuttig explained. \"So instead of that liquid, you could use this alloy.\"\nThis is only an option because of the alloy's record-breaking endurance, he added.\n\"That alloy needs to be stressed and recover millions of times. Refrigerators have to last 20 years, right? That's the expectation.\"\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter\n [OUT] ",

As a result, a generation of private renters have emerged and this will increasingly be the norm for the 20 to 39 age group,\" said Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC.\n\"There is also a rising dichotomy in the market between those - mostly older - households who own outright and those - mostly younger - households who still have a mortgage or rent to pay.\"\nOwnership issues for young adults would become more acute owing to a lack of supply in affordable housing, the PwC report suggested.\nThe contrast between young and old would be marked by the number of people owning their homes having bought in cash or having paid off a mortgage.\nThe number of homes owned outright would rise from 8.4 million now to 10.6 million by 2025, accounting for 35% of the total, PwC said.\nOverall, it predicted that the proportion of residents who owned the home they lived in would drop from its peak of 70% in the middle of the last decade to about 60% in 2025.\nAbout 7.2 million households would be private tenants in 10 years' time, it suggested.\nThe recently-published English Housing Survey found that, in 2013-14, some 48% of households made up of 25 to 34-year-olds rented their home from a private landlord.\nThis had risen from 45% a year earlier, and from 21% in 2003-04.\nOver the same 10 years, owner occupation in this age group dropped from 59% to 36%.\nIn 2013-14, of the 22.6 million households in England, 7.4 million owned their property outright, and 6.9 million had a mortgage, the survey showed.

That means that relief has to be cut back and carefully targeted to the most needy.\nThe BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says this is a huge strain for Lebanon, the smallest and most vulnerable of Syria's neighbours.\nLast month the Lebanese foreign minister said the crisis was \"threatening the existence\" of his country.\n\"The Lebanese people have shown striking generosity, but are struggling to cope,\" Mr Guterres said.\nThe UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, notes that the influx of refugees is accelerating.\n\"Every day, UNHCR in Lebanon registers 2,500 new refugees: more than one person a minute,\" the agency said in a statement.\nInternational aid agencies are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the flow of refugees.\nUNHCR has only received 14% of the $6.5bn (ÃÂ£4bn; 4.7bn euros) funding it has asked for.\nThe hardships many refugees are facing was dramatically highlighted last week when a mother with a sick husband and four children set fire to herself in protest at not receiving help. She was critically injured.\nThe civil war in Syria between Sunni-led rebels and the government of Bashar al-Assad has also fuelled sectarian tensions in Lebanon, which has a large Sunni and Shia Muslim population.\nHundreds of people in Beirut and other parts of the country have been killed in violence between opponents and supporters of President Assad.\n [OUT] ",

They looked excited and enthused in attack, playing with width and subtlety and were throwing caution to the wind.\nThe width they were playing with often created mismatches - backs attacking forwards - on the edges of the defensive line.\nTim Nanai-Williams and Reynold Lee-lo were exceptional and regularly beat the first man. They were playing in a traditional Pacific Island style, not worrying too much about structure or exits - and this suited them.\nThe plus side for Scotland was that they looked dangerous when they had the ball too. Samoa's defence wasn't particularly structured.\nThey were there to put a show on in attack, but they were very keen to put the individual big hits in which can be very destructive when it comes off - but it can also create dog legs to exploit.\nA noticeable tactical call from Scotland was to turn down kicks at goal and kick to the corner instead.\nMy theory on this was that they were trying to starve Samoa of the ball, to make them defend and not give the ball back until they had an extra five or seven points. It also showed a real confidence in their line-out maul and ball retention.\nThe ironic thing was that they failed to score from the first set of drives and it was only once Scotland had Ryan Wilson sin-binned that they converted the maul into points.\nOne of Scotland's first-half issues, and a problem area for the whole World Cup, was kick-off receipt. Samoa won back their first three kick-offs, kicking short and up the middle.\nEven when Scotland put a 'pod' in that target area, Samoa regained the ball. It is an area that needs to be addressed because, as I've mentioned before, it's a real momentum killer.\nScotland decided to kick long with their kick-offs, pincering the Samoans deep in their 22m. I think this tactical decision was made as they knew Samoa were going to want to throw the ball around and was an area where they could build pressure.\nThe Scots had very good numbers in their front-line chase where normally there would be a more passive chase on the edges. This suggests it was a deliberate ploy and the pressure resulted in the Tommy Seymour try.\nScotland were probably fortunate to still be in the game at half-time, but they deserve credit for this and were clinical with their opportunities.\nSamoa seemed to self-combust just after half-time, giving away seven penalties in 15 minutes. It gave Scotland a foothold in the game, allowing them territory and possession. The match slowed down and, with that, the sting went out of the Samoan attack.\nScotland continued with turning down kickable penalties into the second half, but after a few efforts, they bore no fruit. Greig Laidlaw decided enough was enough and kicked the points.\nThere was a fairly crucial moment at 52 minutes, one that showed how important the rub of the green is.\nThe momentum was all with Scotland and, with the score at 26-26, Samoa kicked off.\nFinn Russell had his kick charged down deep in his own 22m. It could have ricocheted anywhere but in this instance dropped nicely into Wilson's hands and, after a 30m break, Scotland were awarded a penalty and it was 29-26.\nCritical to the victory was the decision to take the scrum in front of the posts at 73 minutes, a brave call that resulted in Laidlaw's try.\nIt's the process of the decision and previous decisions that was impressive. There were discussions, and decisions were made with clear heads, with a rationale behind them.\nThis is the sign of a strong leadership group. The game could have slipped away, but when Scotland needed to step it up, that's what they did.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The Juventus midfielder left Old Trafford in 2012 because of a lack of first-team opportunities, but he could become the centrepiece of Jose Mourinho's new-look United side.\nPogba's talent has been evident for years. That was why United signed him from Le Havre in 2009, when he had already captained France's Under-16 team.\nHe was the same lithe, energetic athlete he is today, if somewhat more gangly. What he has done, according to knowledgeable sources, is apply himself and work at his game.\nNow 23, he still has a tendency to float in and out of matches - he was not a consistent performer at Euro 2016 and did not appear to relish the deeper role he was given by coach Didier Deschamps when France lost to Portugal in the final.\nBut he has developed a greater understanding of his game and, with that mental maturity, more awareness of his positional responsibilities to the team as a whole.\nIn his first spell at United, he would be walked through specific situations to improve his game management, or be taken to senior matches and told to watch individual players rather than the game itself. This experience has been put to good use.\nUnder 21 football in England may be derided, but occasional outings alongside senior players also helped his education.\nPogba is not the finished article. But the promise United first identified seven years ago is showing positive signs of being fulfilled, more than enough to persuade the club to potentially pay such a massive fee.\nPogba made three substitute appearances for Manchester United in the Premier League, before joining Juventus for the 2012-13 season.\nPogba was brought to the club as a 16-year-old boy, deemed good enough to play a central role in an FA Youth Cup final triumph in 2011, but was allowed to leave for an overseas rival, before being bought back for a world record fee four years later.\nWas it a mistake of gargantuan proportions or the consequence of a couple of isolated events combining to produce a very expensive outcome?\nSir Alex Ferguson wanted to keep Pogba in 2012. Still only 19 at the time, Pogba and his agent Mino Raiola were made a contract offer and rejected it, meaning that all Juventus had to pay was a compensation fee of Â£1.5m for the teenager.\nRaiola believed Pogba should have been in the first team and on first-team wages. Ferguson felt he was still too raw to feature on a regular basis. It can't have helped that Ferguson and Raiola were like \"oil and water\", in the Scot's own words.\nThe pivotal decision came when Paul Scholes, at the age of 37, reversed his retirement decision in January 2012.\nScholes played 21 times in that half-season - and a further 21 in the campaign that followed. United were denied the title by Sergio Aguero's injury-time goal for Manchester City against QPR on the final day in 2012. They won it in 2013 - after which Scholes retired for good - but have not challenged since.\nThere is no way of knowing what would have happened if Scholes had stayed retired and Pogba had played those games instead. It is just as impossible to assess whether the young midfielder would have developed at the same rate in England as he has done at Juventus, with whom he has won four successive Serie A titles.\nAnd had he remained at United, would Pogba now be looking to leave - just as Cristiano Ronaldo did for Real Madrid as he entered his prime?\nOne thing is for sure: ignoring a player you need, just because you had him once and let him go, would be cutting off your nose to spite your face.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt is tempting to say that if a club spend going on for Â£100m on a player, the system fits around him, not the other way around. Football is not quite so straightforward, though.\nEven the best players can struggle without a structure - or if they are played out of position.\nIt is still a source of bewilderment to staff at United as to why Angel di Maria - their previous record signing at Â£59.7m - was used as a holding midfield player by former manager Louis van Gaal. Di Maria, it is worth remembering, began his Old Trafford career with three goals and three assists in his first five Premier League appearances from the offensive position he was so effective in for Real Madrid.\nPogba is a rarity in the modern game in that he is capable of both attack and defence. He is quick, has stamina and can tackle. Though not a prolific scorer, his average of one goal every five games suggests he is an attacking threat.\nAnd while his average of one yellow card in every four games would put him under threat of suspension if repeated in England, he was not sent off last season.\nIn short, he is the kind of player United have lacked since Roy Keane left in 2005 - without the red cards. Mourinho will surely stick him in the centre of his midfield and work from there.\nIn his recent interview with the BBC, Mourinho said he did not understand why there was such uncertainty over Wayne Rooney, who was \"the club captain, the players' captain and my captain\".\nHowever, there are many reasons why there are doubts about Rooney's future role at United.\nIncluding transfer fees and wages over the respective periods of their contracts, Mourinho - when the Pogba deal is complete - has committed Â£250m on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the Frenchman.\nA front-line striker, a creative offensive player and a dominant midfielder are three of the four fundamentals Mourinho identified as needing urgent attention when he replaced Van Gaal.\nAt various points in his United career, Rooney has filled all these roles.\nIn noting United's deficiencies and by addressing them in such a calculated manner, it is a fair assumption Mourinho intends to utilise his new additions, particularly in the biggest games.\nRooney, for all his many attributes, is no speed merchant. Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Memphis Depay definitely are, making them better suited to wide positions. If the plan is to play Mkhitaryan wide, or deeper, in midfield, there is an obvious space for Rooney at number 10.\nBut is that going to get the best from the Armenian? Mourinho likes his central midfield to contain aggressive, athletic players, such as Claude Makelele and Michael Essien from his first stint at Chelsea. Pogba is in that mould. Morgan Schneiderlin and Daley Blind could work effectively alongside him. If that happens, the uncertainty over Rooney will persist.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe manager who says he is truly happy with his squad, that he has the best player possible for any position and could not countenance spending a little bit more, has not been invented yet.\nMourinho himself has said he would act \"if something presents itself before 31 August\".\nWhat it is safe to say is that he won't be spending any more money without recouping some. Even accounting for the demands of six pre-Christmas games in the Europa League, United's squad is too bulky as it is.\nYet standards at Old Trafford have slipped so much since Ferguson's departure three years ago that it is hard to argue the issues have been rectified completely by Mourinho's four \"fundamental\" signings, which go straight through the spine of his team.\nFor instance, 12 months ago, United were engaged in a concerted attempt to get central defender Sergio Ramos out of Real Madrid.\nIt did not happen and Van Gaal did not recruit anyone else. In 23-year-old Ivory Coast defender Eric Bailly, who has played only 40 La Liga games, have United really strengthened their defence to Mourinho's satisfaction?\nSo who might go to create space? German World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger and Belgian wide man Adnan Januzaj evidently have no future at Old Trafford. The same is also true of Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair, two of the youngsters Van Gaal took pride in promoting.\nOf the 23 outfield players Mourinho is prepared to base United's season around, Marcos Rojo's alarming impetuosity identifies him as one potential candidate. Antonio Valencia continues to give the impression of being a winger trying to play full-back, rather than someone sure of his surroundings.\nSchneiderlin, Matteo Darmian and Depay were all massive disappointments in their first United campaigns.\nIt is generally unwise to form concrete opinions on a single season, particularly on players coming to England for the first time - as it is solely on performances in a major tournament. Nevertheless, none of that trio can be sure of themselves.\nAnder Herrera is yet to show sustained form. And what of Juan Mata? The incredibly popular Spain midfielder, who United spent Â£37.1m on halfway through David Moyes' short tenure, was sold by Mourinho during his second spell at Chelsea.\nThat the questions and doubts are so numerous come as a direct result of both United's fifth-place finish last season and the various awful performances that contributed to it.\nUntil they wake from their post-Ferguson slumber, the forensic analysis of United and their players will go on.\n [OUT] ",

But around 2,000 vigilantes received some military training and are now on the government's payroll.\nOften they man checkpoints, spotting potential suicide bombers. But they also operate alongside the army in the bush where Boko Haram militants take shelter.\n\"It's like rich people that go hunting,\" one vigilante told me. \"When the army says there's an operation we all want to go.\"\nThe vigilantes are normally armed only with wooden clubs, machetes and homemade weapons.\nThe authorities are cautious given that heavy-duty weapons could fall into the wrong hands or be turned against them.\nWhile many Nigerians view the vigilantes as heroes in the fight against Boko Haram, they have been accused of human rights abuses from rape to extortion - and extra-judicial killings of suspected militants.\nNow, after years of fighting, there is a growing concern that battle-hardened vigilantes could turn into a militia that the authorities are not able to control.\n\"There is a strong sense of entitlement among the vigilantes,\" says Mr Obasi.\n\"They believe they not only saved Maiduguri but have fought an insurgency on behalf of the Nigerian government.\nHe says that most wish to be formally absorbed into the military and security forces or at least be recognised, and paid, by the government, while others expect scholarships, skills training or grants to set up small businesses.\n\"The fear is that unless these expectations are addressed, the authorities could have a big problem on their hands.\"\nAt an abandoned office building used by the vigilantes as a make-shift headquarters, scrawled on the wall in chalk is the message: \"Forgiving a terrorist is left to god. But fixing their appointment with god is our responsibility.\"\nIt is here that I meet Lawan Jaafar, 39, the chairman of the Civilian JTF.\nHe still works as a leather merchant and cattle trader when not leading the organisation.\nHe's a man of quiet intensity and purpose - he commands the respect of the thousands of vigilantes he heads.\nEarlier this year, he was detained by the Nigerian security forces on suspicion of selling cattle to Boko Haram militants. He was later released without being charged.\nBut it shows how Mr Jaafar is now a powerful player in this part of the country - and some other actors want to clip his wings.\nHe carefully weighs his words: \"I'm appealing to the government to provide jobs to the vigilantes and to take care of the poor families of those who lost their lives for the cause.\"\nHe has this warning if nothing happens:\n\"We're going to have problems with armed robbery and kidnapping - because if a man has no job, he will do anything to survive.\"\nNo-one in north-east Nigeria doubts the bravery of the vigilantes. They have helped immensely in putting Boko Haram on the back foot.\nBut unless their sacrifices are recognised, they could end up presenting a new security threat.\n [OUT] ",

The ruling ANC faces elections next year and is keen to avoid another flare-up of violence.\nWhile mining only contributes about 6% of South Africa's GDP (financial services and manufacturing command larger slices), it generates nearly 60% of the country's exports.\nBut the opening positions of the players involved seem to be so far apart that the negotiations are likely to be racked by tension, deadlock and possible walkouts.\nThe two big unions, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), have demanded pay increases of 60% and 100% respectively.\nThe gold mining companies say that double-digit increases are unaffordable.\nAnalysts expect months of industrial action on a scale that could be worse than that seen last year.\nThat would leave the entire sector in a precarious position and would have severe knock-on consequences for the South African economy as a whole.\nThe ratings agencies Standard & Poors and Moody's downgraded the country's debt last year, partly due to worries over the mining sector.\nThe Chamber of Mines, which represents the mining houses, says a widespread strike in the gold mines would mean a loss of 349m rand ($34m; ÃÂ£23m) for each day of lost production.\nMeanwhile, the loss of miners' wages in a strike would result in the government losing 9m rand in tax revenues every day.\nMuch of the easily accessible gold has already been taken out of the ground. That which lies in the deeper reefs is becoming increasingly costly and dangerous to get at.\nIn addition to this, over the past five years, wages have increased by an average of 12.3% per year, compared with an average inflation rate of 5.9%.\nDuring the same time, gold production fell by 21%. Last year, the average worker produced 1.18kg of gold. In 2007, that figure was 1.49kg.\nLast month, the World Gold Council released new guidelines for calculating the true cost of producing the metal.\nThe new \"all-in\" measure takes account of capital expenditure and licensing for the first time, as well as the day-to-day running costs.\nThis significantly raises the cost of producing an ounce of gold.\nGold Fields chief executive Nick Holland said the new method would mean an ounce of gold would cost nearly $1,400 to produce. At a time when the gold price has fallen to about $1,200, this makes many mines unprofitable.\nBut Loane Sharp, a labour analyst with Adcorp, says the complaints made by the mining companies about the price of gold (over which they have no control) are somewhat overdone. For example, 10 years ago the price of gold was closer to $300 an ounce and many mines were still profitable.\n\"In many cases complaints about the gold price are a ruse, since the uncontrollable gold price allows mine management to divert attention from their own role in mine profitability, namely control of costs,\" he says.\nAnalysts say if the mining companies are forced to grant high wage increases, they will simply counter this with massive layoffs.\nFirms have also embarked on programmes of mechanisation, basically replacing workers with machines.\nLoane Sharp points out that while mine production between 1990 and 2012 increased, the labour force shank from 1.2 million to 514,000 - the result of mechanisation.\nBoth sides in the wage negotiations recognise the need to reach common ground.\n\"We believe the minerals of this country must now benefit the people,\" AMCU said in its demands to the gold companies.\n\"But unless the wage talks reach an outcome that reflects the balance sheet realities, neither companies nor workers can salvage a gold industry crushed between a toppling price and climbing costs.\"\nWhile Mark Cutifani, chief executive of Anglo American and the president of the Chamber of Mines, said: \"The future of the mining industry is in our collective hands and by working together we can ensure its sustainability and return it to profitability for the benefit of all South Africans.\"\nBut while the public statements by the players talk of solutions found collectively, there will be hard bargaining and tough decisions made in the coming months. Much is at stake in an industry that could be entering its twilight years.\n [OUT] ",

For the last three years, two thirds of pupils in Wales got A* to C grades - and results in England have now dropped to the level here.\nThe north east of England was doing slightly better than Wales last year but now for A* to C grades, all of the northern and midland English regions are not performing as well as Wales.\nNorthern Ireland's consistently higher performance - it has improved again - has been put down to its system of selective schools, where pupils are tested at the age of 11 and the brighter ones get places at grammar schools.\n\"Inevitably comparisons will be made with the results in other parts of the UK, notably with England,\" said Rebecca Williams, policy officer at teaching union Ucac.\n\"But the most important comparison, in terms of learners' performance, is the comparison with previous years here in Wales.\"\nEducation expert Prof David Reynolds, of Swansea University, said results had plateaued over the past three or four years.\n\"There have been similar results and you could say the system is maxed out if you like,\" he said.\n\"But it's not true, if you look at the range of variations in schools. There are huge differences still between the top and bottom performing schools.\"\n\"And if you look within schools, there are big 20-30% variations in the percentage of A* to C within the same school in core subjects\"\n\"If they did as well as the best they could still improve\".\nHe said those in education in Wales had not done enough to \"shift around the good practice\".\nGirls still out-performing boys\nThe performance gap between girls and boys is not a new phenomenon - it goes back more than two decades - and the pattern between how much better girls are doing than their male counterparts has followed a strikingly similar pattern in Wales to England in recent years.\nAt the highest grades A* and A, the gap increased to 7.4% in 2016 in Wales, slightly higher than in England (7.2%). When the new top grade came in, it was 5.8%.\nSo 15.6% of entries from boys were A* and A - compared to 23% of girls. The gap in England was 16.6% for boys and 23.8% for girls.\nLooking at the grades A* to C, the gap is now 9.2% in Wales - the highest for several years.\nFor these grades, 61.8% of entries from boys got A* to C grades compared 71% of girls.\nRob Williams, policy director of the head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said despite boys improving, the gender gap was still a \"stubborn feature\".\n\"Teachers know that this is not just a feature of the qualification results as for a significant proportion of boys pre-reading skills, concentration and their readiness to learn on school entry is already under-developed,\" he said.\n\"They may already be playing catch-up at the age of four.\"\nMr Williams added: \"For the minority of boys with underdeveloped literacy skills and a less resilient self-confidence, accessing a wider curriculum that relies so heavily on effective reading and writing can be daunting and, particularly as they get older, result in detachment and disengagement.\"\nHe said there was a fear that accountability measures at the end of the Foundation Phase - which aimed for a less formal learning approach - were inhibiting the ability of schools \"to be true to its principles, narrowing the focus too much, too soon\".\nHe said schools which were innovative used teachers to target resources and engage pupils.\n\"For example, concentrating on developing their literacy skills, confidence and resilience, teachers have proven to improve boys' ability to access, enjoy and achieve in the wider curriculum,\" said Mr Williams.\n\"The best approaches also engage fully with parents, families and the wider community to create greater aspirations for our children and young people.\n\"If the positive messages about educational achievement and wider benefits are aligned between home and in primary school and beyond, the opportunities for boys to experience continued future success can be maximised.\"\nIt may not all be rosy for girls however, with Cardiff University research out this week suggesting they are more likely to feel anxious and that they don't \"belong\" in school than boys.\nFewer pupils are taking French\nThere has been another fall in the numbers of pupils taking GCSE French - a drop of 11%.\nA study last year found the studying of modern languages had declined rapidly in Wales since 2002, with the then education minister saying he wanted to see children starting to learn at primary school.\nThere has been a rise in entries for German this year after a drop in 2015, although Spanish entries have gone down.\nRebecca Williams of Ucac said there had been a \"steady and dramatic pattern of decline\" in recent years.\n\"There's a combination of reasons for this, including 'crowding out' of the curriculum, that is, having as few as three options, from a range of around 25; the perception that English is the only important international language and that everyone else can speak English,\" she said.\nShe added that other factors included \"brutal cuts\" to support services for the teaching of modern foreign languages such as Cilt Cymru \"and the fact that we start teaching languages too late - the older we get, the harder it is, and age 11 is already a late start in terms of language learning.\"\nHow are we doing in core subjects?\nThere is another indicator for how well pupils are doing in core subjects at GCSE but we won't know this for the 2016 exams until later in the year.\nLast year, 57.9% of pupils in Wales got five or more GCSEs at A* to C grades, including English or Welsh and maths. It is no longer possible to compare meaningfully with England because of changes in maths introduced there in 2014.\nOne complication this year though is that the results from independent schools will not be included in the overall Wales performance measures, so we will need to take this into account.\nWhat about schools which are underperforming?\nSchools Challenge Cymru is a Â£20m Welsh Government project geared at improving 40 underperforming schools.\nSince Summer 2014 they get access to more money, advice and support in order to boost GCSE performance.\nThe first set of results under the scheme were published last year and showed that while around two thirds of the schools saw an improvement in their GCSE results, 13 of the 40 schools got worse results.\nOpposition parties in the Assembly have questioned the value of the project.\nEarlier this year before becoming Education Secretary, Kirtsy Williams questioned First Minister Carwyn Jones about the scheme saying it \"only assists a limited number of schools\".\nThis year's results will not be officially available until October but they will be a further test of whether the project has driven up standards.\nIt is getting (even) harder to compare GCSE results\nMajor changes in the exam systems and more students taking subjects like maths and English early mean it is becoming increasingly difficult to interpret GCSE statistics.\nThis year's results will also be the last based on the full set of \"old\" GCSEs.\nIn Wales, those taking GCSE maths is 25% down on last summer - but that is because a new GCSE maths syllabus started last September and pupils will be opting to take the first exams in this in November.\nAnd from next year, comparisons year by year and by nation will be even harder.\nOther new GCSEs already being taught in Wales include numeracy, English and Welsh language and literature.\nFurther new GCSE courses are being rolled out in Wales in science, drama, French and from next year for business, history and religious studies.\nThere is also a big overhaul of qualifications happening in England.\nNext year, GCSEs in England will not be graded alphabetically but with numbers - 9 to 1, with 9 the highest grade. The current grade C pass in England will not have a direct equivalent - it is expected to cover the bottom of grade 5 and top of grade 4.\nIn Northern Ireland, there will be a mixture of numerical and letter grades, with one exam board bringing in an additional C* grade.\nSo with the A* to G grading remaining in Wales, comparisons will be a complicated business!\nProf David Reynolds said simple comparisons were obviously going to be out.\n\"The danger is that all we're left with is Pisa which isn't great in comparing countries,\" he said.\nThat would increase the pressure on Wales and we will be \"left with a testing where we've already done poorly and getting worse and that's worrying.\"\nPisa - published by the OECD - compares the performances of 15-year-old pupils in reading, maths and science over 58 nations. The next set of test results are expected in December after results for Wales in 2013 were described as \"stark\".\nRebecca Williams of Ucac said comparisons were becoming futile as the reforms take place over the next three years.\n\"Once we've got a few years of the new system under our belts, we'll be able to make meaningful year-on-year comparisons within Wales,\" she said.\nShould pupils be allowed to sit exams early?\nWhile in England there has been a move back to 16-year-olds sitting their exams in the summer at the end of their GCSE course, in Wales it is more common for pupils to sit their exams early.\nIn maths in particular there has been a growing number of so called \"early entries\" with pupils sitting exams either at the end of Year 10, a year into the course, or in the following November.\nReforms introduced in England in 2013 were meant to stop schools \"gaming the system\" and encouraging pupils to take GCSEs early to \"bank\" good grades.\nIf they failed they would simply retake.\nBut former English Education Secretary Michael Gove changed the system so that only the first attempt would count towards a school's performance data.\nIt led to a 40% drop in the number of 14 or 15 year olds entered for exams in summer 2014.\nIn Wales, there have been similar concerns.\nBut when the reforms were introduced in England, the then Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis chose not to introduce the same changes in Wales.\nAlthough he warned that he would intervene in future if schools didn't stop voluntarily and appealed to head teachers to \"do the right thing\".\nFor:\nAgainst:\nThe exams watchdog Qualifications Wales says it intends conducting research looking at the benefits and disadvantages of early entry.\nEntry patterns this year may also be different because of GCSE reforms and new courses starting. So, for example, there has been a big jump in pupils taking English literature and Welsh as a second language a year early.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Geneticists estimate that migration from Africa to South-East Asia and Australia took place as recently as 60,000 years ago.\nBut Dr Michael Petraglia, of Oxford University, and colleagues say stone artefacts found in the Arabian Peninsula and India point to an exodus starting about 70,000 to 80,000 years ago - and perhaps even earlier.\nPetraglia, whose co-workers include Australian and Indian researchers, presented his ideas at the British Science Festival, which is hosted this year at Aston University.\n\"I believe that multiple populations came out of Africa in the period between 120,000 and 70,000 years ago,\" he said. \"Our evidence is stone tools that we can date.\"\nMost of the tools are from far inland - hundreds of kilometres from the coasts. This means it was more likely humans migrated by land than in boats, he said.\nThe tools are found in areas that are often very inhospitable now, but which at the time would have been much more conducive to migration.\n\"During the period we're talking about, the environments were actually very hospitable,\" he told BBC News. \"So where there are deserts today, there used to be lakes and rivers, and there was an abundance of plants and animals.\"\nThe team found the stone tools - ranging from a couple of centimetres to nearly 10cm in size - in layers of sediment that they can date using sand and volcanic material found above and below the implements. The tools were mainly either spear heads or scrapers.\nIn particular, some tools were sandwiched in ash from the famous Toba eruption that geologists can date very accurately to 74,000 years ago.\nOther species of early humans clearly left Africa before our species (Homo sapiens), but Dr Petraglia's team thinks that the tools it has found are the type made by modern humans - and not those of Neanderthals, for instance.\nPrevious research has leaned heavily on examining the genetics of different modern populations to find out how long ago they shared a common ancestor - their African common ancestor.\nProfessor Chris Stringer, of the Natural History Museum in London, said this genetic data showed humans left Africa around 60,000 years ago or even more recently.\nHe agreed that \"these tools show that people were in these regions, but the genetic data show an exit from Africa of later than 60,000 years ago. The people in India could have died out.\"\nDr Petraglia, however, suggested that researching these migrations using population genetics might not lead to accurate results, because all of the genetic studies were based on today's people.\nThe absence of ancient DNA to make additional tests made this area of investigation much less reliable, he claimed.\nDr Petraglia's team now hopes to continue its excavations in the region. \"We have literally hundreds of projects in Europe and a handful in the Arabian-South Asian belt,\" he said.\n [OUT] ",

That's why I decided I needed to go. I'm supposed to go. I don't have any choice.\"\nNour and her mother, Islam, fled Deir al-Zour in Syria three years ago. Her father, who stayed behind, was killed shortly afterwards. She and her mother eventually moved to exile in Turkey.\nFor two years in Istanbul, she enjoyed a comfortable life. Nour found work in a hair transplant salon, and later with Turkish state TV. She learnt Turkish, went horse-riding and dyed her hair blonde for the summer.\nBut she wanted to start a new life away from the region. She aimed to make it to the Swedish city of Gothenburg where her brother lives with his young family. There, she would apply for political asylum.\nNour planned to follow the increasingly familiar migrant trail from the Turkish coast to northern Europe.\nIstanbul to Gothenburg by boat and by land is a 2,500-mile (4,020km) trip. A Facebook group for Syrians shares advice on prices and routes. Istanbul-Gothenburg, including smugglers' fees, costs about â¬3,000 (Â£2,200; $3,780).\nOn the early morning of 15 August, Nour's mother took her to Istanbul airport for the short flight to the coast. Just before boarding, her mother began to panic.\n\"She caught me by the hand and said: 'Come back. Don't go.'\n\"I said: 'Mum, don't be crazy!'\n\"I was crying, and throughout the trip I remembered [the expression on her face].\"\nIn the Turkish coastal city of Izmir, Nour met up with five Syrian friends - one of whom is nicknamed \"The Doctor\" and another one whom she called \"Devil\".\nThey paid smugglers $1,200 each for the 10-mile boat journey to the Greek island of Agathonisi.\n\"We were 48 people inside,\" Nour said. \"We spent three hours in the sea. It was very difficult. [The smugglers] taught one person to steer the boat. But he didn't know how to use it and it broke in the middle of the sea.\nBut the boat made it to Greece. Exhausted, the friends took Greek boats to the island of Samos, then to Athens. They made their way overland to the border with Macedonia. During their trip, hotels turned them away.\n\"We slept in the streets for two-three days,\" said Nour. \"It's very bad actually. No-one respects Syrian people - it's like we're diseased or something.\"\nThe group took a bus from Macedonia into the Serbian border town of Presevo, which is crowded with new arrivals.\n\"We are very tired,\" Nour said, \"very sick, all of us.\"\nNour decided not to join the crowd of refugees waiting to register for Macedonian travel papers. She was desperate not to be stopped and fingerprinted on her way to Sweden.\nIn theory, you have to stop and apply for asylum in the country which first registers you. This rule is not always enforced, but many refugees refuse to take the risk and do whatever they can to avoid being fingerprinted.\nFrom Presevo, Nour's group took the bus north to the Serbian capital, Belgrade, where they found a place to stay in a run-down area.\nIt was the eve of their attempt to cross into Hungary, the start of the EU's Schengen area - its border-free zone.\n\"If we pass safe - that's fantastic,\" she said late at night by phone. \"It would be a disaster to be fingerprinted.\"\nAt dusk the next day, hundreds of migrants and refugees walked along train tracks into Hungary to be met and registered by the Hungarian police. But Nour and her group did not want to be spotted. They paid a driver â¬300 to drop them 10 miles from the Hungary border.\n\"Actually I'm very afraid,\" she says at that point; \"if we're passing safe, we are safe.\"\nThe group picked up their bags. They walked for hours at night and crossed the border along a deserted track. By this time, most members of the group were ill.\nBut entering the EU's single border area did not end their worries. Nour's group found an apartment, where she collapsed with a fever. The police came round to demand â¬50 bribes not to take them in. For two days, Nour was too sick and too scared to make phone calls.\nAfter she got better, she reached the Austrian capital, Vienna.\nHer friends (including \"Devil\") carried on to Germany - from where they happily texted her pictures of the good food they were finally able to eat.\nNour headed alone towards her final stop - Gothenburg. Even at this stage, well inside Europe, she was afraid of police checks on board the train. She would only be able to relax once she crossed her final border.\nBut the frontier between Denmark and Sweden lies in the middle of the Oresund strait. It is almost entirely unmarked. The train proceeded along the bridge between the two countries.\nGustav, an 18-year-old Swedish student - sitting across the aisle - looked at his phone.\n\"It's switched to a Swedish carrier,\" he said casually. \"That means we're in Sweden.\"\n\"Finally!\" Nour said, with a smile. \"It's like a dream. All the way when I was looking through the window, I said: 'Where am I? Is it true? Am I going to Sweden?'\"\nShe sent a message to her mother on WhatsApp to tell her she had made it. Her phone soon rang. Her mother was calling just to make sure.\n\"She didn't believe I was in Sweden. She said: 'Are you sure you're in Sweden?'\"\nAt 18:20, two weeks and 13 hours after she began her journey from Istanbul, the train pulled into Gothenburg's main station.\nNour was finally able to declare herself to the country of her choice. She wanted to get the opening words of her asylum plea exactly right. Her brother sent her the text of what she should say to the police.\nShe repeated those words again and again to herself as she walked towards the nearest police station. She pressed the intercom and went inside.\n\"Hello, I am a Syrian refugee. I would like to apply for asylum in Sweden.\"\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Australia's extinct marsupial lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, was the continent's top predator at the time of human arrival 50,000 years ago.\nWeighing more than 100kg, the animal had sharp claws and a powerful jaw, and shearing teeth that could rip through the flesh of its prey, which included giant kangaroos, rhinoceros-sized herbivores known as diprotodon, and possibly humans.\nBut while experts agreed on the marsupial lion's fearsomeness, whether or not they could climb rocks and trees has been a source of contention.\nSome speculated that the lions' anatomy would lend itself to climbing, while others argued they would have been too heavy to clamber up to high places.\nNow palaeontologists at Flinders University say they have found the answer in a cave in Western Australia where marsupial lions left thousands of scratch marks.\nThe scratch marks, mostly made by juveniles and clustered on a near-vertical rock surface leading to a now-sealed exit, suggest two things about the lions: they were skilled climbers, and they reared their young inside caves.\n\"[Our findings indicate] the [marsupial] lions were running up and down these rock piles to get out of the cave, and they weren't using the lower-gradient, longer route,\" says associate professor Gavin Prideaux, who supervised the research.\n\"We can be confident now and say that they could climb.\n\"And if they could climb really well in the dark, underground, there's no reason they couldn't climb trees.\n\"They would have been a very significant threat to people when they first arrived in Australia.\n\"What we're dying for are different lines of evidence that shed light on the behaviour or ecology of these animals, and that's what we've been presented with in the form of these claw marks.\"\nThe team's findings, which reinforce some contentious ideas about the behaviour of these \"highly adapted\" and \"anatomically bizarre\" predators, have been published in Nature's open-access journal Scientific Reports.\nThe claw markings were found inside the Tight Entrance cave near the Margaret River.\nIn the mid-90s, bones inside the cave were identified as belonging to extinct megafauna, dating from 30,000 to 150,000 years old, says Prof Prideaux.\nBetween 1996 and 2008, he went on numerous expeditions to the cave to collect fossils, and during that work discovered the scratch marks.\n\"We had the feeling that they were probably Thylacoleo scratch marks, but we had to test it,\" he says.\nProf Prideaux and his honours student, lead author Samuel Arman, established a list of seven species of animal that could have been responsible.\nIt included the extinct marsupial lion, as well as Tasmanian tigers and Tasmanian devils, which used to live on the mainland, wallabies, koalas, possums and wombats.\nMr Arman left scratch pads inside zoos and wildlife parks, and collected tree bark to get sample claw markings from the living animals, which he compared to those inside the cave.\nThis helped the researchers narrow their list to two key suspects: marsupial lions and Tasmanian devils. But they needed another clue.\n\"We went through the more than 10,000 bones we collected from the cave to look for evidence for bite marks or little chewed-up bones [which are] absolute hallmarks of devil dens,\" says Prof Prideaux.\n\"We found zero of that.\"\n\"This is more consistent with what we've inferred about the behaviour of Thylacoleo from its dental morphology, and that is, it was primarily a meat eater and not a bone cruncher.\"\nMr Arman also reconstructed a skeletal hand of the marsupial lion and made mock scratches on modelling clay that \"perfectly matched\" the large ones found in the cave.\nThe animals, which became extinct around 46,000 years ago, lived all across the continent. Prof Prideaux suspects similar claw markings exist in caves elsewhere, but have yet to be discovered.\nDr Judith Field, an expert in megafaunal extinctions from the University of New South Wales, says \"the methods used to determine the size of the animal making the marks appear well conceived and well executed\".\n\"It is highly likely these marks were made by Thylacoleo,\" she told the BBC. \"They are probably the only animal with claws large enough to effect these scratch marks.\"\nStill, Dr Field expressed some reservations about the study: \"Most of the conclusions are speculation,\" she said. \"Great discovery, and a neat story, but these assertions about their behaviour have yet to be substantiated by empirical data.\"\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] But the latest allegations against Donald Trump have prompted an important national conversation about the wider abuse of women.\nIt's a conversation that is long past due, about something too many women have experienced in painful silence, and men for the most part are unaware.\nEvery woman who has been the victim of unwanted sexual advances - and I don't know very many women who haven't - has strong emotions about this and a lot of unanswered questions.\nThe political fallout of the New York Times and People Magazine accounts is pretty clear.\nTrump has vehemently denied the allegations, but women are deserting Donald Trump. His chances of winning the White House are diminishing. His campaign is in disarray, he himself is sounding increasingly apocalyptic.\nSo let's try instead to examine some of those more awkward abuse questions, because they reveal something rotten in our society.\nA lot of women, especially women just starting their careers, encounter men who do or say things that are sexually inappropriate.\nIt's worth noting that Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Dominique Strauss Kahn (to name a few) have been the subjects of multiple allegations, whilst no one has ever accused Barack Obama, George Bush or Ronald Reagan of groping.\nMost men would never dream of doing such things, but women quickly learn who not to get stuck with in an empty office.\nMen in powerful posts are particularly dangerous because the higher you get, the less people say no to you. That's true everywhere - in business, in politics, in the military, in the civil service, even in journalism.\nRachel Crooks says she was 22 when Trump kissed her without consent. She had introduced herself to him because her employer did business with him. When he later asked for her number, she acquiesced - because, the Times says \"of Mr Trump's influence over her company.\"\nOccasionally, men too get put in an uncomfortable position by a female colleague - but the scale is incomparable.\nA colleague from the New York Times described interviewing young women who'd been held by Boko Haram: they would admit to beatings and torture but swore they'd never been raped. The women knew that if they said they'd been raped, they'd never be able to return home.\nThe United States is not Nigeria, but even here women who talk about sexual abuse are often called liars or shamed publicly.\nMr Trump has done just that today - calling the accusers \"horrible people\" and implying the People Magazine journalist wasn't attractive enough for him to harass.\nHe seems furious that anyone would say he put his hand up a stranger's skirt on the plane, or forced his tongue into someone's mouth - calling the Times reporter who wrote the story \"a disgusting human being\".\nBut how is it different from the activity he described on that Access Hollywood tape?\nAbuse happens in private, so it's inevitably a case of she said/he said.\nBut we do know abuse is a lot more common than people like to think. There are a lot more instances throughout history of women being raped and no one being prosecuted than there are of women falsely claiming rape and a man suffering the legal consequences.\nThe balance is overwhelmingly stacked against women.\nA silver lining in #TrumpTapes story\nWhy this Trump row is different\nHillary's campaign and Bill's women\nMr Trump said that if he had indeed assaulted Jessica Leeds more than three decades ago, she would have come forward with her story much earlier.\nShe says that at the time, it was just the cost of being a woman in business.\n\"We accepted it for years,\" she told the Times. \"We were taught it was our fault.\"\nNow 74, Ms Leeds says it was only Mr Trump's flat denial of his actions at the second presidential debate that prompted her to go public.\nSome women do keep abuse quiet for a long time because it is humiliating. Women who have been assaulted are often asked, why didn't you just say no?\nBut that's just a way of blaming the victim and transferring the guilt from the abuser to the abused. The only shame here belongs to the men.\nIt looks like we are going to spend the final three weeks of the US presidential election scraping round in the sordid gutter of sexual misbehaviour. What's abuse, what's not, whose history is worse - it's all going to get an airing.\nBut maybe out of this miserable political campaign, we can try to do something useful. We can shine a light on the dark secret of sexual assault.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] In a letter urging congregations to vote on 7 May, the House of Bishops does not endorse a political party but encourages debate on issues such as nuclear defence and the economy.\nIt speaks of Britain's \"almost moribund political culture\".\nConservative MP Conor Burns said the letter was \"naive\", but David Cameron said he welcomed the move.\nThe 52-page letter - an unprecedented intervention by the House of Bishops - says \"it is the duty of every Christian adult to vote, even though it may have to be a vote for something less than a vision that inspires us\".\nThe Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, said there was \"disengagement with the contemporary political culture\" and rejected the pleas of some, such as comedian and actor Russell Brand, for people not to vote.\nHe told reporters: \"We as bishops are not as sexy as Russell Brand but we say 'do vote, do engage and do use the hard-won political freedoms that you possess'.\"\nThe letter says the country needs \"a new approach to political life that will change the political weather as decisively as did the administrations of 1945 and 1979\".\n\"The ideals that the Big Society stood for should not be consigned to the political dustbin,\" the letter adds.\nThe Big Society was among the Conservatives' flagship 2010 election policies and encouraged greater personal responsibility and community activism in shaping society and running public services.\nBut by January 2013 charities expressed \"huge frustration\" at a lack of progress with the idea, which they said appeared to be \"going nowhere\".\nThe document covers various issues including:\nThe bishops are well aware that their pre-election letter will be seen by some as a left-wing document - although they have been at pains to stress that their intention is not to back one party over another, nor to create a wish-list of policies - although they do ask voters to back the \"living wage\".\nThey say that the two UK administrations that offered genuinely new visions - Clement Attlee's Labour party in 1945 and Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979 - changed the way people in Britain looked at society, politics and the role of government and human relationships - but that today, neither vision addresses contemporary needs, at a time of increasing public alienation from mainstream politics.\nIn recent weeks, the Archbishops of York and Canterbury have asked questions about the increasing divides between North and South, or richest and poorest in the UK.\nSo this latest intervention, questioning what kind of society an increasingly diverse Britain wants to be, and what kind of power it wishes to wield on the world stage, is a sign of a Church more willing to use its position to speak truth unto power, even if it is not always welcomed.\nConservative MP Nadine Dorries said she believed the letter had \"glaring inaccuracies\" regarding the economy and the Church should be more concerned with issues people wanted to hear its views on, such as abortion.\nShe said the bishops had a \"very definite left-wing leaning to their message\".\nHowever, the prime minister said he was \"keen for anyone to intervene in politics\".\nMr Cameron said: \"We want to have a political debate in this country.\n\"We've created an economy with genuine growth, real jobs and real security and I would say to the bishops, I would hope they would welcome that.\"\nLabour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have not commented on the letter.\nBut Stephen Timms, Labour's shadow employment minister, tweeted that he welcomed the \"thoughtful and authentically Christian reflection on the election debate\".\nConor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West, said the letter was \"naive\" in not taking into account the recession and the risk posed by countries like Iran.\nPaul Whiteley, professor of government at the University of Essex, said the letter's policies were a combination of the Green Party, SNP and \"perhaps a bit of Labour\".\nHe said it had been a \"long time since the Church of England aligned with the Conservative Party\".\nThe director of public affairs for the Archbishops' Council, Malcolm Brown, rejected suggestions the letter was an attack on coalition policies and criticised responses to the document.\n\"The media response is to interpret it as an attack on the coalition,\" he said.\n\"David Cameron has reacted as if the letter was a rehash of earlier disputes about welfare reform.\n\"In short, the bishops have been thoroughly vindicated. If the responses of the media and the PM are typical of our political culture, it is unfit for purpose.\"\n [OUT] ",

That's the story of rock n roll,\" says US journalist Danny Fields.\n\"The invention of boy bands became an industry thanks to the Bay City Rollers.\"\nAs the editor of 16, an influential American teen magazine, Fields was part of a press junket to Scotland in the summer of 1975 to witness the phenomenon that was driving teenage girls in the UK wild.\nFields says watching the scenes on the streets of Glasgow was like witnessing the triumphant return of conquering heroes in an epic movie.\n\"It was like Ben Hur except it was all these girls wearing ugly pants,\" he told the BBC Scotland documentary Rollermania: The Biggest boy band in the world.\nMusic publicist Carol Strauss Klenfner, who organised the press trip, says: \"It was just crazy, 12-year-olds and 14-year-olds all dressed up in Roller garb, with that look in their eye, of love. It was young love personified.\n\"They were so young and so fresh-faced. They were these wonderful Scottish fair complexions with rosy cheeks. They were wild-eyed and they could sure scream loud.\"\nFields and Strauss Klenfner were witnessing the high-point of Rollermania in the UK, with number one singles, sell-outs tours, the band's own TV show and thousands of hysterical tartan-clad teenage fans screaming at them wherever they went.\nBut getting to that point had not been easy.\nIt had been nine years since two Edinburgh brothers - Alan and Derek Longmuir - had formed a band with their school mates.\nThe Saxons decided they wanted a more American-sounding name and stuck a pin in a map of the US, landing in Bay City, Michigan.\nPersonnel changes and the arrival of local pop promoter Tam Paton as their manager drove the band on as they gathered a loyal following around Edinburgh.\nBy 1971, Paton had landed the Rollers a deal with Bell records and they had a hit single, \"Keep on Dancing\", which crept up the charts to number nine.\nAlan Longmuir says: \"It was brilliant. We were just young guys. I was a plumber to-trade, my brother was a joiner, Nobby, the singer, was a joiner.\"\nBut it was a false dawn and their next two singles failed to make the charts.\nPaton made changes to the line-up and to the band's look but by the end of 1972 the Rollers were starting to look like a one-hit wonder.\nBell Records brought in hit-makers Phil Coulter and Bill Martin, who had written Britain's first Eurovision Song Contest winner, Puppet on a String, for Sandy Shaw in 1967.\nMartin, who was from Govan, says: \"I was always looking for a Scottish band and I thought they were quite special. Quite different from any other pop group.\"\nCoulter was impressed by the band's \"unshakeable\" belief they would be superstars but he says the reality was they could hardly tune their own guitars.\nHe insisted session musicians were used to lay down the tracks in the studio because it would take too long to get the right sound from the band.\nAs they worked on the new sound, there were more changes in the band's line-up with Les McKeown brought in to replace Nobby Clark as the lead singer.\nAnother new face was 16-year-old Stuart Wood.\nHe says: \"I was gobsmacked. I'd only been playing guitar just over a year and probably knew about five or six chords.\"\nWith the classic line-up in place, and Bill and Phil on board, the hits began to come.\nRemember (Sha La La La) got to number six in early 1974 but it was Shang-a-Lang that kick-started Rollermania.\nProducer Bill Martin says: \"It was phenomenal. It just took off like a rocket.\"\nStuart Wood says: \"From not having anyone screaming to having thousands of people screaming at you was pretty quick.\"\n\"The noise was colossal,\" says Martin. \"They were a sensation.\"\nAccording to Coulter the big difference was the age of the girls buying the records and screaming at the band.\nThey were not 16 or 17 but instead were much younger.\n\"This was whole new thing,\" he says. \"That was the gap in the market.\"\nAt the end of 1974, their debut album - Rolling - was at number one but the Rollers were not happy.\nCoulter says the band wanted to be more hands-on, writing their songs and playing on their own tracks.\nHe refused and the band demanded a new producer.\nPhil Wainman was given the task of keeping the hits coming but the Rollers had to play and sing on the records.\n\"That was quite a task,\" he says.\nBut it was one he was equal to and in early 1975 Bye Bye Baby went to number one and stayed there for six weeks.\nWainman says: \"It was selling 75,000 a day. You can have a hit these days with just 20,000 records.\"\nThe next single \"Give a little love\" also went to number one and Rollermania took over the country.\nThe band even had their own TV show.\nAt the height of the mania the Rollers undertook their biggest UK tour to-date.\n\"That was a crazy tour,\" says McKeown.\n\"We would go on and the police would make us stop because they just could not control the crowd.\"\nThe strain of constant touring was compounded when, on a rare visit home to Edinburgh, McKeown ran over and killed a 76-year-old woman.\nHe says: \"I can remember just being in complete shock. I don't know how long it took me to come out of that shock.\n\"In retrospect I should have dealt with the issue in a much more comprehensive way.\"\nThe day after the accident McKeown rejoined the tour.\nThe Rollers management had no time to give McKeown a chance to deal with the incident, they were already planning the next stage of their global domination by breaking them in America.\nMusic mogul Clive Davis of Arista Records picked \"Saturday Night\" as their first single in the US, a Bill and Phil production that had failed to chart in the UK in 1973.\nOn 20 September 1975, the Rollers performed at London Weekend Television and were beamed by satellite into the homes of 30 million unsuspecting Americans.\nTheir performance ended with a stage invasion that left Woody and Les in hospital.\nTen days later the Rollers were on their way to America.\nDetails of their flight arrival were leaked to fans so they got a rapturous reception as they touched down.\nPhil Wainman says: \"I went out there and witnessed this unbelievable happening at JFK.\n\"It was like the Beatles all over again. In fact it might have been bigger.\"\nBy January 1976, Saturday Night had climbed to the top of the US Billboard chart.\nAccording to Bill Martin it sold 12 million records.\nDespite success around the world, the cracks were showing and founder member Alan Longmuir quit the band in April 1976.\nHe says: \"I was getting depressed. I just couldn't take it any more.\"\nNew members came and went and the hits started to slow.\nThe band sold 120 million records and conquered the UK, US, Australia and Japan but music journalist Caroline Sullivan says that by late 1977 they had declined in popularity quite a bit.\n\"There is obviously a sell-by date for all boy bands and the Rollers were reaching theirs.\n\"They had a really good run. The fans were growing up and The Rollers themselves were obviously completely fed up with it.\"\nThe band finally imploded when McKeown left in 1978 and bitter battles over the money they should have been paid dragged on for years.\nDerek Longmuir says: \"We were definitely ripped off but there was a big element of naivety as well.\n\"People would come along and tell you, 'you guys just concentrate on the music and we'll do the business stuff' and you just accepted that.\"\nBill Martin says: \"I have no qualms about saying about Tam Paton that he was a disgrace.

The DNA profile was incomplete, however, and he was acquitted at Winchester Crown Court in 2012.\nWith no other suspects, the case was about to be effectively shelved in 2013 when Det Insp Martin Chudley, of Hampshire Constabulary, led a final review of the evidence.\n\"I always felt it was impossible that he left nothing behind,\" he said.\n\"It was a long, prolonged attack, he was there for quite some considerable time - I just couldn't conceive there wasn't a part of him there somewhere.\"\nForensic samples taken from Mrs Edmonds' trousers and the rolling pin had been thought to be the most likely to yield the killer's DNA as those were items which had clearly been touched.\nHamlen's DNA had been found on the rolling pin but had been mixed with that of Mrs Edmonds. This meant a full profile may have been there but was masked by their shared characteristics.\nAfter the acquittal, Det Insp Chudley asked scientists to re-examine samples taken from the original murder scene.\nHe was told it was \"unlikely to work\", but the team decided to examine some of the fibres from the back left sleeve of Ms Edmond's blouse. It proved crucial and in February 2014, a full profile of Hamlen's DNA was identified.\nThe Court of Appeal subsequently quashed the original not guilty verdict, paving the way for Hamlen, 36, to be put on trial for murder for a second time.\nThis time the DNA evidence was strong enough, along with mobile phone evidence, for the prosecution to place him at the murder scene.\nHis mobile phone had been used nearby, close to the time of the murder, and again near to where Mrs Edmonds' mobile had been switched on and then discarded.\nForensic scientist Geraldine Davidson told jurors the material found on the blouse was 26 million times more likely to have come from Hamlen than someone else.\nThe prosecution alleged he had targeted her for her money. Hamlen had a history of domestic violence and cocaine use, was suspected of dealing drugs and was thought to be considerably in debt.\nHowever, he flatly denied any involvement in the killing.\n\"I know I didn't do this, I could not do something like this,\" he told the court. \"As far as the DNA goes, I'm not an expert.

I always thought of her as safe in her little cottage by the river.\n\"She was the heart of the family - she brought us all together, she was the warmth of the family.\n\"I think it will bring some kind of closure, some kind of justice which she deserves.

We will then be able to robustly defend our methods of scrutiny and better serve those who protect us, and the public.\"\nHowever, in a statement, Acpo said it was \"concerned\" at the prospect of the move, which was \"a decision that does not appear to supported by the evidence and is based on an apparent misunderstanding of the role played by the Metropolitan Police Service\".\n\"Counter-terrorism policing is not directed through a single lead force but rather has responsibility vested in nine chief constables across the UK in areas where the threat is considered to be the greatest.\n\"These chief constables act collaboratively and effectively on behalf of all forces, while at the same time maintaining close and critical links into local policing.\"\nIt said the current system was \"admired and respected by other countries\".\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] There was hardly any capital to back up a balance sheet then burgeoning beyond the two trillion pound mark. That's before we all came to the rescue.\nThere may be even less capital before too long, but this is of the typeface variety.\n\"RBS,\" it is reported, is becoming \"rbs\". You could call it typographical subversion. Or a symbolic expression of lowered case humility.\nWe're told in the Guardian that it's disappearing from the frontages of the City of London offices which usually appear when its latest loss or mis-selling misdemeanour is on the telly.\nIn its place and in England and Wales, NatWest is taking on a much more prominent position.\nAs a high street brand south of the Border, we already knew that RBS is becoming Williams & Glyn - reviving a defunct brand before spinning it off to become a separate banking entity and competitor. (That's under instruction from the European Commission.)\nIn Scotland, the initialised bank is being un-initialised, returning to Royal Bank of Scotland (or perhaps \"royal bank of scotland\"?)\nObservers of corporate verbiage won't be surprised to find that the bank's marketing and branding people have applied their imagination to both the re-brand and the explanation.\nThe RBS spokesman doesn't confirm or deny the report of going lower case, but says: \"We are and always have been a bank of brands\". It gets better.\n\"As part of our strategy to build a stronger, simpler, fairer bank we are directing our efforts to make each of our customer brands number one in their respective markets.\"\nThe best bit is coming up: \"Our brands are our interface with our customers and through them we will be able to connect more deeply with customers and rebuild pride in the great things these brands do for our customers.\"\nThey have a point, though it may be a bit irritating for customers to be told they are interfacing with a brand, and indeed, connecting deeply with it, rather than applying for a loan or getting some cash out of a machine.\nBrands matter and can be very valuable in building and retaining customers' trust.\nThe problem with RBS is that it's suffered seven years of toxicity.\nAnd here's the evidence that NatWest has been much less damaged:\nThese figures show what happened when pollsters, on behalf of RBS, asked customers if they would recommend the bank to a friend or colleague.\nThe numbers (simplified a bit) show the difference between those who say they would, and those who would not. NatWest has more personal recommenders than detractors, but the reverse is true of RBS in Scotland.\nIn Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is in even deeper trouble, following the property crash and an IT meltdown.\nIn business banking, NatWest has been seen more negatively than positively by its customers, though that has improved to a small net positive. The RBS deficit has been reducing, but it remains rather large.\nWhen asked if RBS and its brands can be trusted to \"do the right thing\", it's striking that more RBS customers think it does not than those who think it does. Trust levels in NatWest are far higher.\nThat ought to interest those who think we should be shopping around and switching banks more often.  Even if they wouldn't recommend their banks or don't trust them, customers stick with what they know. Either loyalty, habit or inertia is strong, or they quite like to dislike their bank.\nAny branding expert will tell you that the key to a good rebrand after a reputational calamity is that the new look has to be accompanied by a genuine change.\nThat is, it's not enough to stick a new logo on the branches, vans and headed notepaper, and expect people to believe you've changed, if you haven't.\nRBS chief executive Ross McEwan, with a background in retail banking, surely knows that.\nHe won't want to invest in an expensive rebrand - even if it's reducing capital letters to lower case ones - unless he is confident that he can back up the symbolic change with a real change when customers do that \"deep interface\" thing.\nAll this reminder of reputational catastrophe makes you wonder what the branding volks are up to at Volkswagen headquarters over in Wolfsburg.

Certainly there are plenty of excellent academy schools too, which he acknowledges.\nIn terms of council-run schools, only yesterday, schools minister Nick Gibb singled out some of the worst performing local authorities in terms of GCSE results.\nSo it cuts both ways.\nLabour wants the government to press the pause button so they can look at the system of holding academy trusts to account and ensure it's robust.\nThat's not going to happen.  Instead the government will continue to point to its network of eight regional schools commissioners whose job it is to do just that.\nIf anything, all the signals are that the foot will be on the accelerator towards all schools in England becoming academies.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] While the 4-0 defeat in India won't unleash the investigations, reviews and upheaval of an Ashes humiliation, it could well lead to a change of captain.\nBut the question over Alastair Cook's future is relatively straightforward. He either stays or goes. Joe Root takes over, or he doesn't.\nA much bigger issue for England is how a team including Cook, Root, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, James Anderson and Stuart Broad, who can all rightly be considered as amongst the best in the world in what they do, can be so consistently inconsistent, so prone to collapse and so likely to be on the wrong end of a thumping loss.\nWith a tour of Australia now less than a year away, these are the real questions facing the England team.\nEngland waited four years to find an opening partner for Cook, then two came along at once.\nAmongst the few positives of the tour of India was the emergence of Haseeb Hameed and Keaton Jennings, who both impressed at the top of the order.\nFor 19-year-old Hameed, only the second teenager to debut for England since 1949, an unflappable temperament and technique with no obvious flaws seems ideally suited to opening the batting. The impressiveness of an 82 on debut was only surpassed by 59 not out made with a broken finger in his third Test.\nWhen left-hander Jennings arrived as a replacement, he made a century on debut and followed up with 54 in the final Test. His minimal-movement style has drawn comparisons with Marcus Trescothick, though there are signs he could struggle with deliveries pushed full outside the off stump.\nThe smart money is on Hameed returning to open, with Jennings moving to three and Root returning to number four.\nHowever, England will know that early success is no guarantee of a long future as a Test opener. Of the nine other partners tried alongside Cook since Andrew Strauss retired, both Sam Robson and Adam Lyth made centuries in their second Tests, only to fall away and be discarded.\n\"I'd give Jennings a six out of 10 chance of having a long Test career and an eight to Hameed,\" said former England spinner Vic Marks on Test Match Special. \"There is a fair chance Jennings could be a substantial England player, but I'd put Hameed above him.\"\nEngland's selection came in for criticism on the tour of Bangladesh and India, not only for the XIs to take the field, but a squad that left some members as drinks waiters and tourists.\nThe form of Gary Ballance and Ben Duckett meant wicketkeeper Jos Buttler had to play as a specialist batsman, Steven Finn spent two months in India without getting a game and the omission of Somerset left-arm spinner Jack Leach was only explained by leaked information about concerns over his action.\nEngland director of cricket Andrew Strauss opted not to to break-up the selection panel of James Whitaker, Mick Newell and Angus Fraser when he took charge in 2015, but further questions over the selection process were raised during a row over Anderson's fitness in the summer of 2016.\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that coach Trevor Bayliss, an Australian, has no great knowledge of the English domestic game to fall back on and little time for scouting. He regularly admits to not having seen new call-ups play before.\nCould Bayliss take time away from the national side during limited-overs matches to watch more county cricket? Could Cook, who will play Championship cricket for the first half of the summer, be used as a scout? And what is the role of Andy Flower, the former England coach who now is in charge of the Lions?\n\"Scouting and selection is under-rated, and sitting there in a tracksuit at the ground is possibly over-rated,\" said TMS commentator and former England batsman Ed Smith. \"The biggest issue on this tour has been selection - and one of the problems at the moment is that it's unclear where selection comes from.\"\nIndividually, all of the regular members of England's top order can rightly think they have had a reasonable, if not stellar, winter.\nOf the five men that batted in the top seven in all seven Tests - Cook, Root, Moeen Ali, Stokes and Bairstow - Cook's average of 32 is the lowest.\nBut, collectively, England are simply too prone to collapsing in a heap.  On three occasions in Bangladesh and India they lost all 10 wickets for 104 runs or fewer.\n\"It's like dominoes going down,\" said former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott. \"You push one and they all go down.\"\nLinked to this is England's habit of losing by a huge margin.\nOf the 12 defeats suffered in Bayliss' 26 matches in charge, three have been been by an innings, three more have been by more than 200 runs and another two by eight or more wickets.\n\"One week England will play to a level where you think they are on a pathway to becoming very good,\" said former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Radio 5 live. \"The next week they get hammered.\n\"I think this set of England players have a mental weakness in Test cricket.\"\nIf England have stumbled upon a top four for the summer, then that leaves a vacancy at five.\nThe temptation would be to ask wicketkeeper Bairstow, so prolific with the bat in 2016, to keep the role he filled in the second half of the India tour, with Stokes at six, Buttler at seven and Moeen at eight.\nHowever, Bairstow's career batting average at number five - 30.06 - is much lower than when he bats at six (45.91) or seven (46.50).\nEven in his breakout year, where he is second only to Root on the list of global runscorers, Bairstow has performed much better at six and seven than he has at five.\nAs for the idea of taking the gloves off Bairstow to allow him to focus on his batting, consider this. Over his Test career, his batting average as a keeper (50.96) is almost twice as good as when he doesn't have the gloves (28.96).\nThe statistics suggest England would be better to have Stokes at six, Bairstow at seven and find a specialist to bat at five. If that position is deemed too heady for Buttler, then Essex's Tom Westley and Worcestershire's Joe Clarke are candidates from the current Lions squad.\n\"England need another batsman at five,\" said Boycott. \"All the business with playing an all-rounder or the wicketkeeper there is rubbish.\n\"They need five proper batsmen - that's what India did to them.\"\nThere may, however, be a candidate in the current side...\nThis is not to question Moeen's place in the side, rather the job he is being asked to do.\nThe Worcestershire man was given his opportunity at Test level primarily because of his off-spin bowling. Although he was really only a batsman who bowled, his natural ability as a spin bowler saw him preferred over more experienced candidates.\nEven though he was learning on the job, Moeen initially prospered. However, over the course of his 37 Tests, his bowling has become less, rather than more effective. In 2014 his Test bowling average was 28. In 2015 that climbed to almost 40 and, over 2016, he has taken his wickets at a cost of 53 apiece.\nBayliss admitted that England were looking at Moeen as their second spinner at the beginning of the winter. By the end, he had slipped to third behind Adil Rashid and Liam Dawson.\nTherefore is it time for Moeen, whose four Test centuries are more than any other England player in 2016, to be selected and judged on his batting alone?\nLike Bairstow, he has been shunted around the order, occupying every position between one and nine, but Moeen actually averages more at four or five than he does in his most frequent spot of number eight.\nMoving Moeen would give England space for a specialist spinner, retaining him would give a back-up bowling option and more responsibility at number five may go some way to eradicating the kind aberration that saw him play an awful stroke on the fifth day of the final Test.\n\"Moeen is a wonderful player with a gift to play cricket,\" said Vaughan. \"But he needs something different going on between the ears, to think better about it.\nEngland were not expected to win in India, but the ordeal once again exposed eternal failings in the batting against and bowling of spin.\nTheir most famous recent series win in Asia, the 2-1 triumph over India in 2012, was built on the runs of Cook and Kevin Pietersen, along with the world-class spin of Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar.\nSince Pietersen, Swann and Panesar last featured for England, they have played 10 Tests in Asia and won only once, losing seven. Replacements for high-quality spinners and players of slow bowling have not been found.\nFinding spinners from a domestic game that often mistrusts them has long been difficult for England, but new rules on the toss in the County Championship helped Leach and Middlesex's Ollie Rayner prosper in 2016.\nAs for the likes of Root, Bairstow, Moeen and Stokes, the talent to become a successful player of spin exists, but a change in attitude may be required.\n\"They just have to keep their wickets intact, to keep batting,\" said Boycott. \"But they can't stop scoring runs because they are frightened to death of defending - they are absolutely rubbish at it.\n\"They do not know how to play the turning ball. It demands a different type of concentration, temperament and mental application.\"\nEngland have two years to get it right. Their next trip to the subcontinent is a tour of Sri Lanka in 2018.\n [OUT] ",

They then got another with the last movement of the first half half from Catterick, on as a replacement for the injured Tait.\nBut they failed to fully capitalise on a lethargic second-half performance by the home side, landing only Mike Delany's penalty, as they still look for their first point going into next Friday night's European Challenge Cup trip to France to play Brive.\nWorcester director of rugby Dean Ryan:\n\"I'm fed up of talking about relegation issues as I'm sure Dean Richards is. We shouldn't be judged on the past but where we are now.\n\"We have been competitive in all four matches, picking up 10 points, and we are frustrated that we don't have more.\n\"We are a very dangerous side and showed what we can do when everything goes right. I'm not at all surprised that we picked up a bonus point by half-time.\n\"We didn't attack enough in the second half.

He has been a big figure in recent weeks.\"\nNewcastle director of rugby Dean Richards:\n\"Our defence was woeful. It was all over the place and left us with far too much to claw back.\n\"We defended well in the second half and won it 3-0 but missed a few try-scoring opportunities.\n\"Our league position is a fair representation of how we've played so far but it's not reflective of the ability of the side.\n\"We've had a lot of changes over the past few weeks but we've got to get people singing from the same hymn sheet.\"\nWorcester Warriors: Pennell; Heem, Grove, Mills, Vuna; Heathcote, Arr; Rapava Ruskin, Annett, Schonert, O'Callaghan, Barry, Cox, Mama, Dowson (capt).\nReplacements: Bregvadze, Leleimalefaga, Rees, O'Shea, Betty, Mulchrone, Lamb, Howard.\nNewcastle Falcons: Tait; Venditti, Harris, Socino, Tuilagi; Delany, Young; Vickers, Lawson, Welsh, Botha, Thompson, Welch, Latu, Hogg.\nReplacements: McGuigan, Fry, Vea, Robinson, Clever, Tipuna, Catterick, Penny.\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.\n [OUT] ",

He died in prison last year.\nFor some weeks in 1993 he had worked as a labourer in the Castlederg area for local man Mervyn Finlay, who has since died.\nMr Finlay's statement to police in 2002 explained how Robert Howard had once boasted at work that \"if he killed someone he would not be caught because he knew how to get rid of the body\".\nMr Finlay's statement said he and all his employees had laughed at the time, concluding that Howard was simply boasting.\nBut he thought of the matter again when Robert Howard was charged with Arlene's murder, and contacted police.\nLater, a statement from another man was read to the court, a man who had also known and worked with Howard, as well as statements from his girlfriend.\nThey described how Howard had shown them chemicals from a disused chemist shop store, and had explained how they could dissolve bones, something he spoke of several times.\nThe court also heard statements from two former prisoners who shared a hospital wing with Robert Howard in Crumlin Road jail in 1993.\nThey said that Howard boasted that he had pretended to be claustrophobic to fool the prison authorities, and proffered advice on how to trick psychiatrists.\nAs the inquest continues, counsel for the Arkinson family has criticised some medical reports issued about one of the future witnesses, former police Ch Supt Eric Anderson, who had led the inquiry into Arlene's murder.\nThe Arkinsons' legal team is unhappy with the decision to hear Mr Anderson's evidence via video link, due to conditions explained in the medical reports.\nThe family's barrister also intends to play the court extracts from a UTV \"Insight\" programme where Mr Anderson was filmed appearing to offer documents from the case for sale for ÃÂ£700.\nThere was also considerable legal discussion in court around a Public Interest Immunity certificate already granted to the PSNI.\nThis involves a call to the police in 1996 naming Kathleen Arkinson and her partner Stephen Walsh as Arlene's killers.\nThis information was later considered by the police to be untrue.\nAlthough the person making the anonymous call was later met by detectives, a barrister for the PSNI told the court that the police do not know the identity of the person, and do not know their address.\nHe added that this information was not gathered, at the person's own request.\nThe barrister for the Arkinson family rejected this argument and said of the unnamed witness: \"This person could have flown in from the moon.\"\nThe coroner Brian Sherrard said that the redaction on the documents covered by the Public Interest Immunity certificate was \"modest\", covering \"individual phrases, individual names, individual words\".\nThe inquest continues.\n [OUT] ",

What impact might that have in Northern Ireland?\nThey are effectively a means-tested benefit paid to people on lower incomes. They are paid to two main groups: unemployed people with children and low paid working people who may or may not have children.\nThey are perhaps popularly thought of as a state top-up for low paid working people. There are two types of tax credit: Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit - it is the latter that seems likely to be cut.\nIt is paid at a maximum rate of Â£2,780 per child per year and you are entitled to the full amount until your annual income reaches just over Â£16,000. Then, there is a formula that sees the amount you get taper away as your income rises. It also depends on the size of your family.\nIt is a significant number - on the most recent figures there are 140,000 families in Northern Ireland who get child tax credits. About 89,000 are families where someone is working. If we look at working families who only claim the child element of tax credits, it is worth on average Â£4,000 a year. So we are talking about a significant payment to a large number of people.\nThe government has promised to cut Â£12bn from the benefits bill and has not left very much room for manoeuvre. Before the election David Cameron said he would not touch pensioner benefits, which is the largest part of the benefits bill. He also said he would not make any more changes to child benefit.\nAfter that, there are only three areas of spending where you could find savings that are big enough: disability benefits, housing benefits and tax credits.\nIn June, Newsnight reported that the government was considering cutting child tax credits back to the level they were at in 2004 which, by my calculation, means the maximum amount per child would drop from Â£2,780 to less than Â£2,000.\nTax credits are, as the name suggests, a tax matter controlled by HM Revenue and Customs. That means they are not part of devolved welfare powers and Stormont will have no ability to block any changes. However, in the future tax credits will be phased out and replaced by Universal Credit, something Stormont will have power over.\n [OUT] ",

This time, shortly after 08:00, the long line of vehicles began moving through, on their way to the newly-reopened industrial complex.\nMore than 800 South Koreans were due to cross over into Kaesong on Monday, to restart operations at around half the factories there.\nThe resurrection of the complex is the result of weeks of tough negotiations between the two sides, and those discussions are still not finalised.  Among those heading across the border today were a team of negotiators, tasked with hammering out the details for how the complex would look in future.\nHigh on their agenda is the subject of internet and mobile phone access for the site - contentious issues for the North, but key if foreign investors are to be wooed to the complex as a stabilising influence.\nAfter a five-month suspension of the complex, attracting foreign companies has perhaps become a little harder.  And even South Korea remains wary, calling Monday's operation a \"trial run\", not a formal and permanent re-opening of Kaesong.\nBut Kaesong remains, to many here, the \"canary in the mine\" of inter-Korean relations, and the agreement to resume operations there paved the way for further signs of a thaw between the two Koreas: the restoration of a military hotline, and a planned reunion of families separated by the Korean War.\nIts commercial image may be tarnished, but Kaesong's importance as a political symbol here remains.\nBut the North withdrew all of its workers in April, as ties between the two Koreas deteriorated in the wake of Pyongyang's 12 February nuclear test.\nReopening the complex has taken months of negotiation.\nSouth Korea's Unification Ministry said a total of 820 managers and workers planned to cross into the complex on Monday, with 400 to stay there overnight.\nThey will be inspecting production facilities to assess how quickly a full restart can be implemented after  five months of inactivity.\nThe restart is being described as a trial but more than half of the South Korean companies had asked North Korean employees to report for work, the ministry said.\nNegotiations on resuming operations at the complex faltered for weeks on South Korea's insistence that safeguards must be in place to prevent any future unilateral shut-down of the site by North Korea.\nBut the two sides have now set up a joint management committee to run operations at Kaesong, which last week set a restart date for the complex.\nThe committee has also reached agreement on smoother access to the site for South Koreans by expanding permitted border crossing times and is negotiating about improving communications there.\nThe Koreas have also agreed to open the site to foreign investors - a move seen as making it harder for North Korea to unilaterally close the complex again.\nSouth Korean firms will be exempt from taxes for the rest of the year, to offset losses incurred while the complex was closed.\nBut some local businessmen remain worried about the risks of doing business with Pyongyang.\nQ&A: Kaesong Industrial Complex\n\"Honestly, I still feel a bit nervous, because you never know whether the North will change its mind in the future,\" a textile company manager told the French news agency AFP. \"Who knows if a crisis like this won't happen again?\" he said.\nThe shutdown was the first for the Kaesong complex since it was opened more than a decade ago.\nIt came during a period of very high tension on the Korean peninsula.\nThe 12 February nuclear test led to expanded UN sanctions which, along with an annual US-South Korean joint military drill, angered Pyongyang.\nIt threatened attacks on multiple targets in the region, prompting warnings - and displays of high-tech military hardware - from the US.\nTensions have eased somewhat in recent weeks, however.\nThe two Koreas have also recently agreed to hold the first reunion of families separated by the division of the peninsula after the 1950-53 Korean War later this month. It will be the first such reunion in 10 years.\n [OUT] ",

After a ballot by teachers, the pupil was \"educated off-site\".\nIn a secondary school in north Wales a teenager with a history of disruption had threatened to \"slit the throat\" of another pupil. After a ballot by teachers, the pupil was expelled.\nA teenager at a secondary school in the English midlands, who the union says had assaulted and threatened staff and pupils, stayed in school but was barred from attending classes taught by NASUWT members.\nIn another case, the union says a ballot followed a dispute over how a group of teachers intervened with a pupil with a history of attacking others.\nWhen there were allegations that teachers had \"assaulted\" this pupil there was a \"refusal to teach\" ballot, after which the pupil was removed from the school.\nMs Keates says schools face a \"widespread and increasing problem of pupil indiscipline\".\nThe union asked its members about their experiences of pupil behaviour, receiving about 3,500 online responses.\nAlmost three quarters of respondents claimed there was a \"widespread behaviour problem in schools today\" - a higher proportion than in a similar survey last year.\nThis is not a representative sample, but among those replying, 82% said they had faced verbal abuse from a pupil and 38% from a parent in the past year. Some 23% had been physically threatened by pupils and 16% \"assaulted\".\nAccording to those who responded, the biggest contributor to declining behaviour is an \"excessive focus on data-driven targets\", identified by almost two thirds of teachers.\nMs Keates also blamed increasing class sizes and \"the lack of support for children with special needs in mainstream schools\".\nThe conference will debate pupil indiscipline on Saturday.\nIt will hear claims behaviour standards are being undermined by a \"blame culture in schools that seeks to hold individual teachers responsible for poor pupil behaviour, whilst overlooking the critical role that school leaders should play\".\nThe motion will also criticise a lack of consistency in how rules on behaviour are applied.\nSchool reform minister Nick Gibb said: \"The Conservative party is committed to giving schools the backing they need to tackle poor behaviour. That's why we've made it easier to search pupils, brought back same-day detentions and clarified teachers' power to use reasonable force.\n\"We've also made sure that a head teacher's ability to exclude pupils isn't undermined by external bodies. As a result, three quarters of teachers now rate behaviour in their school as good or better.\"\nA Liberal Democrat spokesman said: \"It is vital that teachers have the resources they need to manage behaviour and support those children who need extra help.\n\"This is exactly why, in government, Liberal Democrats protected school budgets and introduced the pupil premium - extra money to support the children most likely to struggle in class.\"\n [OUT] ",

He now trails Froome by two minutes and 22 seconds.\n\"I am surprised he's lost so much time already,\" said Froome.\n\"I certainly didn't expect it. I thought he was going to be the one guy from the main contenders who would gain time in this first phase of the race.\n\"Nibali and Quintana have lost substantial time already so the pressure is on them to be attacking as we go into the climbs.\"\nQuintana picked up valuable time on Contador and Nibali as his Movistar team finished just four seconds off the pace. He now trails Froome by one minute, 59 seconds.\nContador's Tinkoff-Saxo squad finished 28 seconds behind BMC, to leave him 63 seconds behind Froome.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] A Dutch team is developing clever waders that enthusiasts can wear to find not only the ideal location to fish, but to collect key hydrological data for scientists.\nOf most use to both groups would be waders that sensed water temperature.\nAnglers know this influences where fish go in a river and, for researchers, it betrays details about the movement of water in that river and its chemistry.\n\"We need more data from more streams than we could possibly monitor with our sensor networks,\" explained Rolf Hut from Delft University of Technology.\n\"Wouldn't it be nice if we had citizens walking around in the water, interested in temperature because they want to know where the fish are, and at the same time providing us with the information we can use for our research?\"\nThe data would be collected by a simple temperature probe in the wader boot. This would then travel up a wire to a Bluetooth device above the waist to be passed to a phone in a dry pocket.\nThe angler could use the information straightaway to decide where to stand in the river and cast their fly, while the scientists would receive the details back at the lab over the cell network for later analysis.\nDr Hut and his colleagues are interested in the study of hyporheic exchange, which describes how water moves into and out of a stream through its bed.\nIn dry periods, a stream will lose water into the ground; in wet periods, it will gain it - and where the water comes into the stream, it is usually much colder than what it is joining.\nIt used to be thought this was a fairly gradual process along a stream's entire length, but scientists now realise that the exchange in some locations is actually far more significant than in others.\nThe team's smart waders are in the earliest phase of development, but Dr Hut was able to demonstrate the concept at this week's European Geosciences Union General Assembly - albeit in the rather warm and dry setting of the meeting's poster hall.\nThen there is the question of extending the range of sensors incorporated into the waders.\nRolf Hut added: \"Why stop at temperature? What about water depth?\n\"For hyporheic exchange, it would be interesting to look at salinity; pH would be really interesting for water quality.\n\"And now there are sensors coming on the market that would do water quality parameters like nitrogen levels, dissolved carbon levels - that are really telling you how healthy a stream is.\n\"So that's not necessarily for hyporheic exchange, but for other fields of hydrology and water management. And that's in the interest of the fishers, by the way, because you need a healthy stream to have fish.\"\nDr Hut's attire at the meeting prompted a chuckle of two from fellow hydrologists, but also admiration for the ingenuity.\nNicholas Howden from Bristol University, UK, said: \"Hyporheic exchange is a fascinating topic.\n\"For example, groundwater that comes into rivers tends to be very rich in base cations - the kind of stuff salmon need. They will spawn in gravel beds where there is upwelling.\n\"So, these are locations that are ecologically very important for the river.\"\nThe idea of the smart waders originated from a talk with Scott Tyler of the University of Nevada, Reno.\nBBC iWonder- How can I make my smartphone smarter?\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n [OUT] ",

One officer was also convicted of assault for slapping Mr Tsang twice later on at a police station.\nDefence lawyer Lawrence Lok had argued that the protests had affected police morale, saying that one of the officers who watched the violence had been physically and verbally abused by protesters.\n\"Human frailties resulted in the transgression of seven police officers,\" he said.\nLast year Mr Tsang was found guilty of assaulting and resisting officers on the same evening.

It was a nexus of self-preservation - yet, as the wagons circled, the wheels kept threatening to come off.\"\nThe ECB declined to comment on Booth's criticism when contacted by BBC Sport. However, incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, who is set to take over in May, has already suggested he expects to make sweeping changes to improve the game.\nPietersen, 34, was sacked by England after the 5-0 Ashes defeat by Australia and, while the South African-born batsman has said he would like to return to the international fold, his future remains uncertain.\n\"It was typical of a story beyond the ECB's control that their best moment was not of their own making,\" said Booth.\n\"Having searched in vain for the words that justified his sacking, they were gifted a 324-page solution: an autobiography so full of rancour that BBC chat-show host Graham Norton suggested to Pietersen, 'Maybe, just maybe, team sport's not for youâ¦'.\n\"All the while, he kept insisting how happy he was in the land of Twenty20 franchises - and agitating for an international recall. The whole thing would have been sad, if it hadn't been so absurd.\"\nAlastair Cook had looked set to lead England into the World Cup - despite a 3-1 one-day series defeat by India in the autumn - after ECB managing director Paul Downton said he would be \"surprised\" if the batsman was removed as captain.\nBut he was sacked in December, just two months before what would turn out to be a disastrous World Cup.\n\"To leave the sacking of Cook so late made little sense,\" said Booth.\n\"Trouble was, Cook had become more than just a cricketer: cast by his employers in the role of latter-day saint to Pietersen's fallen angel, he was now an article of faith.\n\"England overplayed their hand: the Test win over a supine India did not mean Cook would effect a similar transformation of the one-day side. This seemed obvious to everyone - except to the men who run the game.\"\nThe ECB found that the number of people playing cricket in teams fell 7% between 2013 and 2014, from from 908,000 in 2013 to 844,000 in 2014.\nAnd Booth has called on the ECB to do more to advance the game in Asian communities: \"The English game needs an Asian player to prosper beyond a few Tests here and there.\n\"If the England team really want to unlock their full potential, it is perverse to be so reliant on (white) southern Africans and smash-and-grab raids across the Irish Sea, and so ignore the more natural solution on our doorstep.\n\"There remains a damaging perception among Britain's South Asian communities that its best young cricketers are not wanted.\"\nAll-rounder Ali, 27, was named as one of Wisden's five players of 2014 in a year in which he took 19 wickets in the Test series victory over India, while 25-year-old Ballance registered three Test centuries and averaged 60.75.\nLyth, 27, helped Yorkshire to the County Championship title by leading the scoring charts with 1,489 runs, while spinner Patel, 34, was commended for his 107 wickets for Warwickshire across all formats.\nAnd Mathews was included for his influence in Sri Lanka's first ever Test series victory in England.\nSri Lanka batsman Kumar Sangakkara was named leading cricketer in the world, while Australia batsman Meg Lanning is Wisden's first leading woman cricketer in the world.\n [OUT] ",

This is smothering the hundreds of diverse ethnic groups in Sudan, and the country's rich East African heritage.\nYousra Elbagir:\nMany southern Sudanese in Khartoum bleach their skins to emulate the northerners they now live amongst.\nPopular culture in the capital, Khartoum, is dominated by TV, film and music hailing from Egypt and the Middle East.\nArab celebrities are revered and imitated, sometimes with devastating consequences.\nSkin bleaching creams are now an accepted norm, sold at pharmacies and supermarkets throughout Khartoum.\nWhile the phenomenon is prevalent across much of Africa, many southern Sudanese in the city bleach to emulate the northerners they now live amongst. The northerners, in turn, whiten their skins to strengthen their claim to Arab ancestry.\nThe resultant raw, reddened skin is almost as much a symbol of the push to \"Arabisation\" as the government's political alliances in the region.\nSo what has changed to prompt this millennial movement to celebrate afro-centricity and Sudanese pride on social media?\nPrimarily, it is a space for identity expression that the government cannot control.\nJewellery designer Nawar Kamal has made a name for herself by using Instagram to promote and sell her African-inspired beaded pieces.\nPhoto shoots featuring Sudanese models wearing African prints, and exploring an Afro-Arab identity, are generating excitement across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\nOne shoot in particular, the \"Dominance Series\" by Enas Satir and Enas Ismail, shows Sudan's \"African\" face dominated by Arab culture, with a woman in a headscarf and Middle Eastern accessories overshadowing another woman wearing braids, beads and tribal markings.\nThis new-found - and public - celebration of African identity is not just controversial at home.\nWhen Sudanese tweeters posted photos to the trending topic \"#ILoveBeingAfrican\", West Africans asked: \"What is Sudan and why is it here?\"\nSudanese users responded by flooding the hashtag with photos, asserting their right to join the conversation.\nTwitter feuds aside, many of Sudan's artists - from painters to poets - are drawing inspiration from this conflicted identity, using artistic mediums to capture customs and traditions that are neither African nor Arab but distinctly Sudanese.\nIn Sudan, as in much of Africa, social media is home to the elite. The hope, though, is that this message of African pride reaches the far corners of the country.\nIn the western and southern regions where Darfuri and Nuba ethnic groups use cultural expression as a tool for resistance against a regime that denies them relevance.\nHere, age-old traditions are not passing trends but an assertion of identity in the face of disenfranchisement and can often be a matter of life and death.\nHow poets are fighting censorship in Sudan\nWhy Sudanese people still feel like pariahs\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\n [OUT] ",

Her second, Human Acts, has since been published.\nShe said the story came about when she revisited her own short story The Fruit of My Woman, which sees a woman literally turn into a plant.\n\"After I finished the short story, I found this inexplicable feeling that I had to rework this imagery.\"\nDeborah Smith taught herself Korean and was smart enough to spot there was a need for translators to turn the language into high-quality English - which she managed brilliantly with The Vegetarian.\nThe prose is relaxed and idiomatic but it's powerful. There isn't a paragraph or turn of phrase which feels like it didn't originate in English.\nThe story is deliberately mysterious but Smith said she couldn't ever call up Han Kang to ask how a particular event or character was to be regarded.\n\"I didn't have any way of contacting her and, as a first-time translator, I wasn't even sure what the etiquette was.  Was I even allowed to ask questions?  So I just got on with putting the book into English.\"\nThe fact that the translator of The Vegetarian comes with an engaging personal story may focus attention on the work of translators generally.\nThat would be a happy result because the lowly status of much literary translation is one of the considerations behind a big rethink this year of how the Man Booker International Prize works.\nTonkin said the judges were unanimous in their choice of winner.\n\"In a style both lyrical and lacerating, it reveals the impact of this great refusal both on the heroine herself and on those around her.\n\"This compact, exquisite and disturbing book will linger long in the minds, and maybe the dreams, of its readers.\"\nThis is the first time the Man Booker International Prize, which has joined forces with the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize, has been awarded on the basis of a single book.\nPreviously, the Man Booker International was awarded every second year to an author for their entire body of work, and was most recently won by Hungarian writer Laszlo Krasznahorkai in 2015.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called it a \"new escalation of the threat\" to the US and the world and warned that Washington \"will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea\".\nPyongyang earlier said it was its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile test.\nUS officials believe the North may now be able to fire a missile to Alaska.\nHowever, experts say it cannot accurately hit a target.\nJust hours after the North's test over the Sea of Japan, the US asked for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the issue. A closed-door session of the 15-member body is expected on 5 July.\nIn a statement, Mr Tillerson said: \"The United States strongly condemns North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\"Testing an ICBM represents a new escalation of the threat to the United States, our allies and partners, the region, and the world.\"\nMr Tillerson stressed that \"global action is required to stop a global threat\".\nAnd he warned that any nation that provided economic or military benefits to the North or failed to fully implement UN Security Council resolution was \"aiding and abetting a dangerous regime.\nThe announcement on North Korea state television said the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un.\nIt said the projectile had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea.\nNorth Korea, it said, was now \"a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world\".\nNorth Korea's official KCNA news agency later quoted Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a \"gift\" to the Americans on their independence day.\nThe launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council.\nBut experts also believe that Pyongyang does not have the capacity to miniaturise a nuclear warhead that can fit onto such a missile.\nHow advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme?\nThe big question is what range it has, says the BBC's Steven Evans in Seoul. Could it hit the United States?\nDavid Wright, a physicist with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, says that if the reports are correct, this missile could \"reach a maximum range of roughly 6,700km on a standard trajectory\".\nThat range would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the large islands of Hawaii or the other 48 US states, he says.\nIt is not just a missile that North Korea would need, our correspondent adds. It must also have the ability to protect a warhead as it re-enters the atmosphere, and it is not clear if North Korea can do that.\nOnce again North Korea has defied the odds and thumbed its nose at the world in a single missile launch. With the test of the Hwasong-14, it has shown that it can likely reach intercontinental ballistic missile ranges, including putting Alaska at risk.\nKim Jong-un has long expressed his desire for such a test, and to have it on the 4 July holiday in the US is just the icing on his very large cake.\nDespite this technical achievement, however, it is likely many outside North Korea will continue to be sceptical. They will ask for proof of working guidance, re-entry vehicle, and even a nuclear warhead.\nFrom a technical perspective, though, their engines have demonstrated ICBM ranges, and this would be the first of several paths North Korea has to an ICBM with even greater range.\nNorth Korea's missile programme\nSouth Korea's President Moon Jae-in has called on the United Nations Security Council to take steps against North Korea.\nBut a strong warning came from the country's Director of Operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Cho Han-Gya said \"Kim Jong Un's regime will face destruction\" if it \"ignores our military's warnings and continues provocations\".\nJapan said \"repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable\" and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would \"unite strongly\" with the US and South Korea to put pressure on Pyongyang.\nUS President Donald Trump also responded swiftly on Tuesday.\nOn his Twitter account he made apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying: \"Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?\n\"Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!\"\nPresident Trump has repeatedly called on China, Pyongyang's closest economic ally, to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programmes.\nOn the prospect of North Korea being able to strike the US, he tweeted in January: \"It won't happen.\" However experts say it might - within five years or less.\nMeanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the international community \"must redouble its efforts to impose a price on this regime, which strains every nerve and sinew to build nuclear weapons and launch illegal missiles, even as the people of North Korea endure starvation and poverty\".\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] That has traditionally been the case as far as immigration is concerned, but ahead of the referendum, immigration from the European Union has come to the fore.\nThe right of 508 million citizens to move freely across the 28-member bloc is one of its fundamental principles.\nToday, there are about three million people from other EU countries living in the UK, and an estimated 1.2 million British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.\nLike it or not, immigration will be a part of some voters' decisions.\nWhen I started going to different parts of the UK to explore the impact of immigration - and attitudes to it - I was struck by the care with which most people addressed the arguments.\nImmigration's being talked about much more than usual in the run-up to the referendum, but I could see how concerned people were to come across in a balanced way.\nPerhaps it's because they were talking to someone whose skin colour and name indicate a foreign heritage, but I think it also tells us something about the fundamental decency of British society.\nBut in the past decade, there has been profound change to the make-up of that society.\nThe EU referendum:\nThe key moment was the enlargement of the European Union, to bring in many eastern European countries in 2004. With wages there much lower than in Western Europe, there was an immediate and obvious incentive to move from the poorer parts of the expanded EU to the richer ones.\nLast year, net migration from the EU - the difference between the numbers of people coming into and leaving Britain - reached 184,000.\nFor me, the stories of two women I met in the course of making a film illustrate the debate. They are both British, both mothers, both living in the east of England but will be voting opposite ways in the referendum.\nIn both cases the simple question they'll be asked on their polling card has a much greater significance - for one, linking into how she believes Britain should be providing better for its citizens - and for the other, how she sees the EU as a symbol of freedom.\nThe first view comes from the Leave voter - Sonia Chowles, 30, from Clacton, the one constituency to have returned a UKIP MP at the last election. From being a thriving Essex seaside resort in the 1960s, it has suffered over the years and unemployment is now above the national average.\nSonia is employed - in a local taxi firm - but life is far from easy. She has two young children and her husband is disabled. She hopes for a council house better-suited to his needs but tells me there is a 15-year wait.\nClacton is home to relatively few people born outside the UK, but Sonia feels its services cannot cope.\n\"I don't think it's a case of no more immigrants - it's a case of no more anybody. English, Scottish, Welsh, from the EU, from America - we just can't physically take any more people into this town.\"\nThe referendum has energised and galvanised Sonia to enter political debate - she's joining UKIP, with a view to standing for election. She's also done her research on the costs of the EU and carefully uses a net figure when talking about Britain's contribution, rather than the gross figure, which has been criticised as misleading.\nOn 23 June, Sonia and her husband will be voting to leave the EU, and she tells me nearly everyone else she knows will be doing the same.\nIf I brought her face-to-face with the other woman on my mind, Grazyna Lisowska-Troc, I know they would have a perfectly civilised debate and probably be able to see things from each other's perspective.\nGrazyna is 43 and lives in Peterborough, having arrived from Warsaw with her husband Tomasz and newborn daughter Agata in 2004. All three are now British citizens.\nGrazyna and Tomasz both work as auditors and their daughter, now 11, goes to a sought-after local school. Part of what they love about the UK is its diversity - Agata is exposed to different cultures and religions in a way that her parents, growing up in Poland, never were.\nAnd for them, the EU also represents an ideal. Grazyna's own mother was deported by the Soviets from eastern Poland to Central Asia after World War Two, and she does not take life in a time of peace and stability for granted. On 23 June, she'll be voting Remain.\nGrazyna is also keen to emphasise what migrants like her give back to the UK: \"Just look at my P60,\" she tells me with a twinkle in her eye, a reference to her personal contribution to the Treasury's coffers.\nHMRC tax figures for 2013-14 support her argument, showing that migrants put in Â£2.5bn more than they took out in benefits. But that does little to address the frustration of citizens in areas where public services are visibly under pressure.\nIn Grazyna's own city, Peterborough, local GP Dr Emma Tiffin told me of the health problems that arise from the conditions in which many low-paid migrants live.\n\"We have a large number in houses of multiple occupancy - several families in one house, sometimes a family in one room.\n\"There are houses that are very damp, and that causes a high risk of respiratory infections.\"\nDr Tiffin sees migration as an added pressure and a challenge to the service she can offer in her part of inner-city Peterborough.\nBut nationally the picture is more complex. Most migrants are young, so they use the NHS less than the average. For the same reason, they have more children, which impacts on maternity services. And both the NHS and the care sector have high numbers of migrants working within them.\nThis issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe.\nWith the UK's population projected to grow by more than four million in the next decade - half of the increase thanks to immigration - this is no longer a conversation politicians can dodge.\nIt may in the end be a question of competing priorities and trade-offs.\nTake one of the most popular words in political discourse - \"aspiration\".\nEvery politician would agree that raising aspirations and improving social mobility is a good thing. But as countries get richer and their citizens more skilled, it's often immigrants who fill the gaps.\nIn what numbers, and to what extent, is the question Britain has to weigh up and, because of the EU's freedom of movement rules, the referendum will be an opportunity for some voters to do just that.\nThe choices both Grazyna and Sonia will make will be rooted in their own experience and in the belief that they are doing what is best for their children. And, on 24 June, we will know whether it was Leave or Remain that proved more persuasive for their fellow citizens.\nBritain & Europe: The Immigration Question is on BBC Two at 21:00 BST on Tuesday 14 June, BBC World News at 04:00 GMT and 15:00 GMT on Saturday 18 June and 09:00 GMT and 21:00 GMT on Sunday 19 June and will be available later via BBC iPlayer.\n [OUT] ",

It says the UK is expected to retain this EU objective even after Brexit.\nIt points out that the government is currently developing its draft industrial strategy from January 2017.\nThat aims to âsecure the economic benefits of the transition to a low-carbon and resource-efficient economyâ.\nEunomiaâs Dominic Hogg accused the government of withdrawing from waste and resources policy over the last seven years.\nThis has led, he says, to the rate of improvement in recycling slowing down, and then going into reverse in England.\nMr Hogg said: âThe most significant changes in recent years have been the switch from landfilling of waste to incinerating it. This reflects a complete absence of ambition, and gives rise to costs that are not justified by the benefits.\"\nâAre we leaving the EU so that we can regain the tag of âthe dirty man of Europe?'â\nHe pointed out that it used to appear environmentally beneficial to burn waste rather than coal. But now the UKâs energy stock is cleaner, incineration looks an increasingly dirty option.\nA Defra spokesperson said: \"We have made great progress in boosting recycling rates. This includes the proportion of household waste being recycled increasing from 11% to 44% between 2000 and 2015.\"\n\"We recognise the need for a mix of infrastructure and this will form part of a renewed strategy on waste and resources that looks ahead to opportunities outside the EU.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin\n [OUT] ",

We asked two experts to give us their answers.\nThis question was asked by an interviewer at an investment bank in the City of London for a job as a sales trader.\nRusty Rueff is a career and workplace expert at online jobs information service Glassdoor.\nFormer head of human resources at Electronic Arts (EA) and PepsiCo.\nCurrent chairman of the Grammy Foundation, which promotes music and music education.\nWhy the question is being asked:\nRusty Rueff, a career expert at Glassdoor, says:\nThis question is testing a candidate's creative skills, including how a candidate can solve difficult and even unusual challenges that might arise. Candidates should think through a response out loud.\nRemember that the interviewer is more interested in how you get to an answer, versus what the answer might be. Also keep in mind that some questions are unrealistic without compromises being made.\nSuggested answer:\n\"To get to this answer, can you provide me further detail, for example, how big is the giraffe? How big is the fridge? Are we in a country where killing a giraffe is legal or not?\"\nDemonstrating that you need facts and truths before jumping to a conclusion can be an advantage.\nContinuing on: \"If the giraffe can die, then fitting one into the fridge has to do with emptying out the rest of the refrigerator's contents and using the tools around me to ensure it fits. What tools do I have to work with in this space?\"\nThis question was asked by an interviewer at a mining company for a job as a dry bulk marketer in London.\nJohn Lees is the author of How To Get A Job You'll Love and Job Interviews: Top Answers To Tough Questions.\nHe runs his own own career coaching consultancy.\nWhy the question is being asked:\nJohn Lees, author of Job Interviews: Top Answers to Tough Questions, says:\nThis question looks oddball but is a humorous and creative way of testing deductive reasoning, which requires you to make and check realistic assumptions and make a recommendation of best course of action.\nYour choice is far less important than the thought process you reveal when answering.\nSuggested answer:\nDemonstrate each step of your thinking:\n\"OK, well I reckon both might kill me, but I would start by thinking about how aggressive each animal might be. Horses can bite and kick, and even though they are small, being hunted by a pack gives you no escape route.\"\nThis question was asked by an interviewer at an international bank for a job as a senior java developer in London.\nWhy the question is being asked:\nRusty Rueff says:\nThis question is another example of an interviewer testing a candidate's ability to solve problems creatively. Think through a response out loud.\nSuggested answer:\n\"What we can see, we can find. In this case what if we were to drench the haystack in a colour that would make the needle easier to see?\n\"Trying to differentiate silver from the gold of hay is hard to do, but if I could turn the hay green, blue, or purple then the silver of the needle would be much more obvious.\"\nThe point is to shed a different light on the problem to find a new solution.\nJohn Lees has more straightforward suggestions:\n\"If the needle is made of steel, a magnet will do the trick. Or you could simply burn the hay off and the needle will remain.\"\nThis question was asked by an interviewer at an accountancy firm in Birmingham.\nWhy the question is being asked:\nRusty Rueff says:\nGiven this question was asked at a major accounting firm, this question is likely testing both the practical and longer term planning skills of the candidate.\nThis is an accounting firm after all, so they probably would like to see someone who wouldn't just blow through Â£1 million. Does this person live in the moment or do they think about the next 10 to 20 years?\nSuggested answer:\nAgain, sound out your thought process. \"While it would definitely be exciting to win Â£1 million, I would want to think through all my options and also be aware of how this money would be taxed before I think about allocating the funds.\n\"Some of the options I would consider include how I could invest this money, how much I could donate to a charity, and how I could use a portion of it to celebrate the win. But, if you are concerned, I'd still come to work on Monday.\"\nJohn Lees adds:\n\"If you can't think of anything, say, 'Great question. What's the best answer you've heard today?'\"\nThis question was asked by an interviewer at a software company for a sales executive role in London.\nWhy the question is being asked:\nRusty Rueff says:\nThis question makes a candidate break down a seemingly complex concept. The interviewer wants to see how a candidate can explain an idea in a way that is meaningful and relevant to the end user.\nIt's also about finding something someone understands from the past in order to comprehend the future. Given this is a sales role, it's a key part of successful selling.\nSuggested answer:\n\"First, it's important for me to let you know that I know my audience well in this case and have done my research on who I'm speaking with.\n\"My grandma does use the internet, is familiar with websites, but knows nothing yet about social networking. So, in this case, I'd say, 'Grandma, I know you love keeping in touch with your friends and family, and I know you love using the internet to find out new information.'\n\"Then I would say, 'There is a website called Facebook which allows you to both connect and stay in touch with your friends and family online, while you're also able to follow companies and organisations you like, to find out their latest news and products.

Some have now landed in Russia.\nA second day of peace talks is being held aimed at resolving the conflict.\nUN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, who is mediating in the talks, welcomed the Russian decision.\n\"The announcement by President Putin on the very day of the beginning of this round of Intra-Syrian Talks in Geneva is a significant development, which we hope will have a positive impact on the progress of the negotiations,\" he said.\nRussian defence ministry video showed the first group of aircraft taking off from Hmeimim air base in Syria on Tuesday morning and in flight.\nHours later, Russian TV showed planes arriving in the southern Russian city of Voronezh, where they were greeted on the tarmac by priests and crowds waving balloons.\nSu-24 tactical bombers, Su-25 attack fighters, Su-34 strike fighters and helicopters were returning home, the TV said.\nBut Mr Pankov said a Russian air group would remain.\n\"Certain positive results have been achieved... However, it is too early to talk about victory over terrorism. A Russian air group has the task of continuing to strike terrorist facilities,\" he was quoted by Ria news agency as saying.\nThe war in Syria has raged for five years and claimed the lives of more than a quarter of a million people. Millions have fled the conflict, but nearly 18 million people still live in the war-torn country - so what is life like for them?\nFind out here\nAnother senior official, upper house defence committee head Viktor Ozerov, said as many as two battalions - some 800 servicemen - could remain in Syria after the withdrawal to guard Hmeimim and the naval base at Tartous, Interfax news agency reported.\nMilitary advisers training Syrian government troops would also stay, he added.\nMeanwhile Kremlin chief-of-staff Sergey Ivanov said Russia would keep its advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system in place.\n\"We are leaving completely reliable cover for the remaining contingent... To effectively ensure security, including from the air, we need the most modern air defence systems,\" Russian media quoted him as saying.\nThe Russian force reduction was announced during a meeting on Monday between Mr Putin and his defence and foreign ministers.\nRussia is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and his office sought to reject speculation there was a rift between the two countries, saying the move was mutually agreed.\nIt has received a guarded welcome from Western diplomats and the Syrian opposition.\nThe Russian air campaign started last September, tipping the balance in favour of the Syrian government and allowing it to recapture territory from rebels, but on Tuesday the defence ministry announced the withdrawal.\nIt is not clear how many military personnel Russia has deployed, but US estimates suggest the number ranges from 3,000 to 6,000, AP reports.\nRussia had long insisted its bombing campaign only targeted terrorist groups but Western powers had complained the raids hit political opponents of President Assad.\nIn a statement, the Syrian government said the plan was agreed between the two countries.\nMost participants in the Syria conflict agreed to a cessation of hostilities, which has been largely holding despite reports of some violations on all sides.\nMeanwhile, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria has presented its report on war crimes committed by all sides in Syria's war to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.\nIts chairman Paulo Pinheiro said the task of pursuing war criminals should not wait for a final peace agreement as there was now \"hope of an end in sight\".\nRussia is one of President Bashar al-Assad's most important international backers and the survival of his government is critical to maintaining Russian interests in Syria. Russia has a key naval facility which it leases at the port of Tartous and has forces at the Hmeimim airbase in Latakia.\nIn September 2015, with rebel forces advancing on Latakia, Russian forces launched an air campaign which President Vladimir Putin said was aimed at \"stabilising\" the Syrian government and creating conditions for \"a political compromise\" that would end the five-year conflict.\nIn March 2016, Mr Putin ordered the \"main part\" of Russia's forces to withdraw from Syria, saying their mission had \"on the whole\" been accomplished.\nDefence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russian aircraft had flown more than 9,000 sorties over almost six months, killing more than 2,000 \"bandits\" and helping Syrian government forces regain control of 10,000 sq km (3,860 sq miles) of territory, including 400 population centres.\nThe claims have not yet been independently verified, but it is clear the air campaign turned the tide of the war in favour of Mr Assad, allowing Syrian government ground forces to regain territory around Latakia, in the southern province of Deraa and around the divided northern city of Aleppo.\nMoscow stressed that its air strikes only targeted \"terrorists\", but activists said Russian aircraft had mainly bombed Western-backed rebel groups and civilian areas.\nIn December, Amnesty International said Russian aircraft appeared to have directly attacked civilians by striking residential areas with no evident military target, which it warned might amount to war crimes. Russia's defence ministry dismissed the report as containing \"fake information\".\nHowever, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in early March that 1,733 civilians, including 429 children, had been killed in Russian air strikes, along with some 1,492 rebels and members of the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, and 1,183 Islamic State (IS) militants.\n [OUT] ",

It creates drama. It creates big fight nights.\n\"It is exactly how I planned it.\"\nIn Ireland, McGregor is now a chat show regular, he has been the subject of a documentary and his name helped ensure that the UFC's Dublin Fight Night was an immediate sell-out.\nBut it is in America where the big money is and the man, whose nickname is 'The Notorious', knows it.\nHe believes a quick defeat of his opponent, Diego Brandao, could put him in line for an opportunity to win the UFC's featherweight championship.\n\"I imagine the title shot will be in Vegas - I almost feel the title shot is already won,\" said McGregor, who seems to have nothing but belief in himself.\n\"I am already picturing a stadium (in Dublin) for a title defence.\n\"I have put in the work. I have put in the time. I feel untouchable.\"\nHowever, success in the UFC, which is regarded as the premier league of mixed martial arts, is anything but easy.\nCompetitors are expected to know a wide-range of fighting techniques including boxing, wrestling and jiu jitsu.\nAnd bouts can be gruelling affairs.\nMany MMA supporters say the UFC's fighters are among the best-conditioned athletes in any sport.\nBut the British Medical Association (BMA) is not impressed by such claims.\nIt has called repeatedly for the sport to be banned.\n\"Every sport has risks but mixed martial arts is human cockfighting,\" said Dr Peter Maguire of the BMA.\n\"The aim is to do as much damage to your opponent as possible.\n\"There are serious health risks.\"\nThe UFC insisted that competitors are well protected.\nIt provides health insurance for its fighters and doctors are always present when bouts are taking place.\nIt also points to the various rules and regulations in place to try to ensure fighters are not injured. Although, inevitably, some are hurt.\n\"In 21 years, the UFC has never had a serious injury,\" said John Kavanagh, who trains UFC fighters at the Straight Blast Gym in Dublin.\n\"There's not a lot of professional sports that can say that in 20 plus years they have never had a broken back or a fatality.\"\nThroughout the Straight Blast Gym, there are people training in the hope of breaking into the UFC.\nJames Gallagher had his first amateur MMA fight at the age of 13.\nHe turns 18 in October and he hopes to turn professional shortly afterwards.\nBut already he is training alongside UFC fighters like Cathal Pendred and Conor McGregor.\n\"Within the next year I believe I will be in the UFC,\" said James, who travels from Strabane in County Tyrone every week to train at the SBG Ireland gym.\n\"It is such an honour to train with guys who are there -  where I want to be.\"\nJames is far from the youngest hopeful. There are several children's martial arts classes taught here.\nOne of the students is Nathan Kelly, who at the age of nine, is already a jiu-jitsu and kickboxing champion.\nHe said his hope is to eventually become the UFC's youngest ever champion.\n\"Jiu jitsu is going to be in the Olympics. Kickboxing is in the Olympics,\" he said.\n\"I want to get that UFC gold and an Olympic medal.\"\nConor McGregor - who openly says he is in the sport for \"the money and the gold\" - believes he is close to that goal he shares with Nathan.\nThat inevitably means there is pressure on him this weekend and he has a nervous energy around him.\nAt one stage, he connected his MP3 player to the gym's stereo to let people hear the music he plans to play as he walks into the arena.\n\"Are you getting goosebumps?\" he asked.\nTo an extent, McGregor is playing the showman but a look of anticipation can be seen on his face.\nHe knows that he must be impressive on Saturday to have a hope of fighting for the world featherweight championship.\nThe UFC's marketing team may well be just as anxious about the contest.\nThe organisation needs well-known fighters to continue its aggressive expansion outside of its core business base in America.\nAnd Conor McGregor is undoubtedly one of its most marketable names, particularly in Europe.\nA title fight would mean a lot to both of them.\n [OUT] ",

He earlier threw one gun, a Colt 45, from a window in exchange for a phone. A .45 calibre pistol was used at all three murder scenes. More weapons were found in a car near the flat.\nMr Gueant said the suspect had no particular demands and that, after initially talking to the authorities, Merah broke off discussions. Negotiations have now resumed, Agence France-Presse reports.\nSurrounding buildings have been evacuated.\nThe suspect's mother, who is Algerian, had been brought to the scene, but Mr Gueant said she had refused to become involved as \"she had little influence on him\".\nThe man shot at the door after police arrived, Mr Gueant said, injuring one officer in the knee and \"lightly injuring\" another.\nThe minister said: \"Our main concern is to catch him and to catch him under such conditions that he can be brought to justice.\"\nThe flat in Toulouse is in a five-storey building and Merah is on the ground or first floor, correspondents say.\nPolice wearing helmets and flak jackets have cordoned off the area.

A scooter was used in all the attacks.\nAn editor of the France 24 network said a man had called it overnight saying he was responsible for the shootings and that he wanted to published on the internet films he had made of all of the killings.\nAlthough there is no confirmation it was Merah, France 24 said he had made the same comments as later reported by Mr Gueant, gave the same age and recounted very specific details of the killings.\nMerah's lawyer said his client was in court two weeks ago for driving without a licence and was \"courteous and civilised\".\nA huge manhunt had been launched after Monday's shooting at a Jewish school that left four people dead, and the killing of three soldiers in two incidents last week.\nThe funerals of the rabbi and three children killed on Monday have been held in Jerusalem.\nAt least 2,000 mourners gathered at the Givat Shaul cemetery on the western outskirts of Jerusalem.\nThe attacker gunned down Jonathan Sandler, a 30-year-old rabbi and teacher of religion, his two young sons Arieh and Gabriel and then - at point blank range - the head teacher's daughter, seven-year-old Myriam Monsonego, in Monday's attack at the Jewish school.\nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has accompanied the relatives of the dead to the funerals in Jerusalem.\nIn his eulogy to clearly distraught relatives at the service, Israeli speaker of parliament Reuben Rivlin said: \"The entire house of Israel weeps over these murders.\"\nIn his televised address, Mr Sarkozy said that he had had a meeting with Jewish and Muslim leaders.\n\"I told them and I tell the nation that we should be united. We cannot give in to discrimination or vengeance. We owe this to the victims who have been killed in cold blood and to our country.\"\nMr Sarkozy will later attend a memorial service for the three soldiers killed in the two attacks last week.\nAll three were of North African descent. Another soldier from the French overseas region of Guadeloupe was left critically injured.\nSocialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande and Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Front National, will attend the memorial service in Montauban.\nAfter Wednesday's raid took place, Ms Le Pen said the \"fundamentalist threat has been underestimated\" in France.\n [OUT] ",

I believe that unveiling relationships between crime and urban metrics can help to guide public policies towards more effective investments, and, consequently, to help prevent crime.\"\nDespite the problems Brazil is facing, Dr Ribeiro said his country was becoming better at tackling its crime problems.  But he added that justice was very slow, which could keep spreading a \"culture of impunity\".\nCriminologist David Wilson of Birmingham City University, UK, said that although murders \"do tend to be concentrated in parts of cities with low levels of income\", the idea that there was a mathematical formula related to population growth \"entirely ignores\" the emotional triggers - or \"foreground factors\" - that lead to crime.\n\"Murder is usually about the loss of face; it's about young men in circumstances in which there's some kind of conflict that results in one of those young men wanting to extract revenge.\n\"It's about the foreground factors much more than the background factors - which this study looks at.\n\"This study doesn't capture the phenomenon of murder. It's such a complicated phenomenon based on emotion,\" Prof Wilson told BBC News.\nHe added that statistical correlations could be found in many kinds of data \"but that doesn't prove cause and effect\".\nBut Luis Bettencourt of the Santa Fe Institute, US, who works with data from cities to analyse human behaviour, said the formula could be applied to other cities too.\n\"When you look at a city and want to characterise it in some way, the obvious one is population size. What's interesting about crime is that the levels of homicides tend to increase on a per capita basis, the larger the city.\n\"The explanation is essentially that cities exist to promote social interaction. And crime is one such social interaction.\"\n [OUT] ",

He presented the progress report to the 35th International Geological Congress in South Africa.\n\"This is an update on where we are in our discussions,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We've got to a point where we've listed what we think the Anthropocene means to us as a working group.\n\"The majority of us think it is real; that there is clearly something happening; that there are clearly signals in the environment that are recognisable and make the Anthropocene a distinct unit; and the majority of us think it would be justified to formally recognise it.\n\"That doesn't mean it will be formalised, but we're going to go through the procedure of putting in a submission.\"\nThe hunt is now on for a \"golden spike\", as it is known - the marker that scientists can point to years hence - perhaps millions of years hence - and say, \"There! That's the start of the Anthropocene Epoch.\"\nAnd it would likely be an \"epoch\", said Dr Waters, meaning the current phase of Earth history known as the Holocene has terminated. We would, however, remain within the Quaternary Period and the Cenozoic Era, which are higher rankings in the division of time.\nTen members of the 35-strong working group believe the best spike will probably be plutonium fallout from bomb tests in the 1950s, to be found in marine or lake sediments, ice layers or perhaps even speleothems (stalagmites and stalactites).\nOthers on the panel, however, think there could be better spikes than the radionuclide. Counter-proposals include remnant plastics or some kind of carbon signature that signifies the rapid rise in CO2 emissions.\nNonetheless, a clear majority of group members (28 of them) accept that whichever marker is chosen, it should reflect events on Earth around the 1950s.\nThis is the beginning of what is often referred to as the \"great acceleration\", when human impacts on our planet suddenly intensified and became global in extent.\nThe Anthropocene Working Group expects to take two or three years, at least, to settle on the best golden spike or spikes.\nOnly then will the scientists produce their final assessment report, which will be sent for deliberation by the international geological community.\nFor an Anthropocene Epoch to be added to the \"official\" timeline of Earth history (the Chronostratigraphic Chart), it will need to win the backing of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) and then be further ratified by the executive committee of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).\nDr Waters said the AWG now needed the assistance of scientists who have cores of ocean sediment, coral specimens, speleothems and the like in their collections. These could all be relevant to the spike investigation.\n\"There may be research groups out there who have bore holes drilled through glacial ice, for example, which go through successions that could be used to define the Anthropocene.\n\"If they were to make those available so that we could do analyses of all the different signals, it would help us understand better whether this concept of the mid-20th Century being the boundary is the best one.\"\nWithout these offers of help the AWG might have to commission new drill holes - a process that could be very time consuming and very expensive.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n [OUT] ",

It includes smart phones, but most fall inside these limits.\nAny affected device, including e-readers and games consoles, will need to be placed into hold luggage.\nNumber 10 said it was up to individual airlines to decide when to begin enforcing the ban and passengers should contact their airline for more information.\nSix UK carriers:\nEight overseas carriers:\nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling said: \"We understand the frustration that these measures may cause and we are working with the aviation industry to minimise any impact.\"\nAir industry consultant John Strickland said the ban would cause \"headaches for airlines and customers\", but carriers had \"no choice but to put security first\".\nWhat are the new rules?\nSimon Calder, travel editor of the Independent, told the BBC the ban would particularly affect passengers who booked cheaper, hand luggage-only tickets, but would now have to pay to check a bag in.\nWhile the US government cited unspecified \"threats\" in its announcement, the prime minister's official spokesman declined to discuss whether the new rules were prompted by specific intelligence.\nThe US ban applies to flights from 10 airports in eight countries. Nine airlines are affected - Royal Jordanian, EgyptAir, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways.\nAsked why the US ban differed from the UK, Theresa May's spokesman said: \"We have each taken our own decisions.\"\nBy Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent\nThis is a controversial decision, and, I'm told, not an easy one for the government.\nThe UK ban goes even further than the US move which does not affect national carriers.\nIt is not the result of a specific, identified terrorist plot, but of mounting concern in US and British intelligence circles at the ongoing interest amongst jihadist groups in the Middle East in blowing up a passenger plane in mid-air.\nThere are some in Whitehall who fear this may be an over-reaction, with damaging commercial and diplomatic consequences. But others have pointed to last year's laptop bomb smuggled onto a flight from Somalia by insurgents from Al-Shabaab.\nThe year before, so-called Islamic State blew up a Russian passenger plane over the Sinai Peninsula. But that bomb was hidden in the hold, where laptops and other devices will still be allowed.\nThe editor of Aviation Security International, Philip Baum, told the BBC that \"encouraging people to check laptops, and other such items, into the luggage hold simply makes the challenge of screening even harder\".\nFor more than two years, the official UK threat level for international terrorism has stood at severe, meaning an attack is \"highly likely\".\nIn July 2014, passengers at UK airports were advised to ensure electronic devices were charged so they could be switched on for security checks.\nThe ban on liquids over 100ml in hand luggage - introduced after a foiled 2006 plot to blow up planes using explosives hidden in drink bottles - also remains in place.\nThe US has given airlines 96 hours, beginning at 07:00 GMT on Tuesday, to implement its ban, which officials said had no end date.\nPassengers on some 50 flights a day from some of the busiest hubs in the Middle East, Turkey and North Africa will be affected.\nThe Turkish government has said the US ban is wrong and should be reversed.\nBut the Department of Homeland Security said extremists were seeking \"innovative methods\" to bring down jets.\nCiting the Somalia incident in February 2016, as well as the 2015 downing of a Russian airline in Egypt and attacks at airports in Brussels and Istanbul, it added: \"Evaluated intelligence indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation, to include smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.\"\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n [OUT] ",

Therefore, for the time being, this approach is unlikely to supplant existing methods for genetic engineering\".\nThe ethical discussions surrounding the creation of synthetic or artificial life are set to continue.\nProfessor Julian Savulescu, from the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, said the potential of this science was \"in the far future, but real and significant\".\n\"But the risks are also unparalleled,\" he continued. \"We need new standards of safety evaluation for this kind of radical research and protections from military or terrorist misuse and abuse.\n\"These could be used in the future to make the most powerful bioweapons imaginable. The challenge is to eat the fruit without the worm.\"\nThe advance did not pose a danger in the form of bio-terrorism, Dr Venter said.\n\"That was reviewed extensively in the US in a report from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a Washington defence think tank, indicating that there were very small new dangers from this.\n\"Most people are in agreement that there is a slight increase in the potential for harm.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Some 500 MPs and activists have demanded an end to impunity.\nIt comes after several female politicians told French media that Denis Baupin had groped or sent explicit messages to them.\nMr Baupin denies the allegations and has said he will sue the publications involved.\nSexual harassment case leaves bitter taste\nThe Paris prosecutor's office has said it is opening a preliminary investigation into the claims.\nThe demand, published in the newspaper Liberation under the front page headline \"Levons l'omerta\" - \"end the silence\" - says women in French politics continue to share information about men to avoid because the men are never held accountable for their sexually aggressive behaviour.\nThis, say the signatories, must now change and those who commit abuses must be accused publicly.\nThe newspaper says a similar letter written last year (in French) by female political journalists about their experiences at the hands of predatory males generated lots of debate, but very little action.\nIt says the same was true of the scandal over the sexual activities of former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was acquitted last year of \"aggravated pimping\" charges.\nAn online petition linked to the latest demand has gained thousands of signatures and tweets on the topic have spread under the hashtag #levonslomerta.\nThe campaign has seen new claims of abuse emerge on social media, including one by a former Minister for Women who applauded the MPs who had made claims about Mr Baupin's behaviour and said she was ashamed that she had not until now spoken out about an attack on her in 1979.\nMeanwhile, current MP Aurore Berge tweeted that the \"Affaire Baupin\" had not yet changed the approach of one male MP.\nShe described how on Monday evening she was greeted with the comment \"When I see you, I want to do a Baupin to you\" as well as a vulgar pun on her name referring to a shepherd's crook.\n\"It's gross, it's pathetic. He was as old as my father,\" she said.\nBut she also described how difficult it is to know how to react to such comments.\n\"You are staggered. Blocked. Should you slap him? Everyone would look at you. You don't laugh? Clearly you were not meant for a life in politics. And anyway, wasn't it funny?\" she said.\n\"You look at yourself. You say to yourself that you shouldn't have worn that blouse. Instinctively, you hide yourself and cover up as if you were the guilty one. And a reflex makes you laugh. Because after all we are French and so we have to laugh about such things.\"\nOther dismissive reactions to the Baupin scandal have also been decried.\nWell-known feminist and left-wing activist Caroline de Haas called right-wing MP Pierre Lellouche a \"pathetic jerk\" after Mr Lellouche reacted to the Baupin allegations by saying he would not comment on \"chicks and their affairs\".\nAnd the four women who have accused Mr Baupin of making unwanted advances have continued to speak about their alleged experiences.\nElen Debost, a regional secretary for the Green Party (Europe Ecologie Les Verts or EELV in French) of which Mr Baupin was previously a member, told French TV that she believed Mr Baupin had carried out the alleged acts as \"a way of spitting in our faces\".\nShe also expressed scepticism about the reaction of Green Party head Francois de Rugy, who told French radio he was \"stunned\" by the affair.\n\"The code of silence and cover ups between friends, he knew,\" she wrote.\nMr Baupin's wife, Housing Minister Emmanuelle Cosse, said she was taking the allegations against her husband seriously.\n\"There has to be an investigation,\" she wrote.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Samantha Jefferies, aged 42, from East Sussex, says the embryos represent her \"last chance\" of having her dead husband's child.\nThe couple were undergoing fertility treatment, but Clive, aged 51, died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage in 2014 and his written consent for the storage of their remaining embryos has since expired.\nSamantha Jefferies, an occupational therapist, told me:  \"These are my embryos and I believe I should be allowed to decide what happens to them.\n\"If they are destroyed I will go through the whole grieving process for a second time.\"\nClive Jefferies served in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was on board the transport ship Sir Galahad when it was bombed in the Falklands in 1982, killing 48 men.\nAfter leaving the army he worked as a nurse.  The couple married in 2007.\nEmbryos, like sperm and eggs can be stored for a maximum of 10 years before couples must renew their written consent.\nMr and Mrs Jefferies had NHS funding for three cycles of IVF which covered the costs of storing embryos for two years.\nThey'd ticked the box to consent to 10 years embryo storage but were asked by their clinic, Sussex Downs Fertility Centre,  to change it to two years because that was the limit of their NHS funding.\nThe couple signed the forms in July 2013 and had two unsuccessful cycles of IVF.\nThree embryos remain in storage.   In April 2014 Mr Jefferies died suddenly.  The couple had been about to have their last cycle of IVF treatment.\nIn early 2015 she received a letter from the clinic saying that consent for the embryo storage would expire that August.\nThe law states that embryos cannot legally be stored once consent has expired.\nMrs Jefferies said she did not want to be denied the last chance to have her late husband's child by a \"piece of bureaucracy\".\nThe Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) wrote to all IVF clinics in 2012 urging them not to restrict embryo storage to two or three years.\nIt told them that this policy risked \"causing significant distress\" in the event of a patient dying and urged them to allow couples to store embryos for 10 years, even if their funding ran out sooner.\nThis guidance was issued more than a year before Mr and Mrs Jefferies signed their two-year consent form.\nThe Sussex Downs Fertility Centre has since changed its policy to match that recommended by the HFEA allowing couples to store embryos for 10 years.\nThe IVF clinic said its previous policy had not been driven purely by financial concerns but also because of the desire to maintain regular contact with couples. It is supporting the case brought by Mrs Jefferies and paying her legal costs.\nSolicitor James Lawford Davies, who represents both Mrs Jefferies and Sussex Downs Fertility Centre told the BBC it was \"common sense that Samantha should be allowed to use the embryos\".\nHe pointed out that Mr Jefferies had consented to the posthumous use of the embryos, so there was \"no question that he wanted them to be available after his death\".\nHe said the IVF sector was still \"very focused on form filling and box ticking\" and he hoped this case would help change that.\nIn 2014 a woman won a legal battle to stop her dead husband's frozen sperm being destroyed. Beth Warren had been told that once her husband's written consent expired, his sperm could no longer be stored.\nBut the court over-ruled the regulations and looked at what had been the intentions of the couple. It agreed to allow his sperm to remain in storage until at least 2023 - many years after written consent had expired.\nMrs Jefferies says she hopes the High Court will be equally sympathetic to her situation.\nShe told me the remaining embryos were half her genetic material and she should be allowed to decide what happened to them, adding that Clive \"would have wanted me to have his child\".\nAn HFEA spokesperson said:  \"We have made it clear to all clinics that they must not align the storage period a patient consents to, with their payment arrangements.\n\"While we do not comment on legal cases, we hope that it may be possible to reach a positive resolution to this matter in the near future.\"\n [OUT] ",

The group often refers to individuals who carry out attacks as its \"soldiers\", but the crucial question is firstly whether the individual had any form of direct contact with IS.\nFace-to-face contact may be unlikely but online communication is possible. If there was no direct contact, it could still be the case that an individual was inspired rather than directed by the group. In this case, an individual may leave his or her own pledge of allegiance in written form or online or in a video.\nBut until such evidence emerges, it remains hard to know if this is just an opportunistic claim by the group rather than one based on real substance.\nMost of the victims were injured by Artan's car, but two were stabbed with a \"butcher's knife\" and another suffered a fractured skull, officials said.\nOne of the wounded victims, William Clark, an Ohio State University professor, described how Artan's vehicle had crashed into a large concrete planter before bouncing off and striking him.\n\"It clipped the back of my right leg and basically flipped me up in the air and I landed on the concrete,\" he told a news conference.\nMr Clark said Artan then got out of the car and began attacking students before he was shot down.\nSurveillance photos showed Artan in the car by himself just before the attack, but investigators are looking into whether anyone else was involved.\nDozens of FBI agents have searched Artan's apartment for clues as to what may have triggered the attacks.\nNeighbours described him as polite and said he attended daily prayers at a local mosque.\nArtan, who was born in Somalia and was a US permanent resident, arrived in the country in 2014 as the child of a refugee.\nHe had been living in Pakistan from 2007 to 2014.\nArtan recently posted on Facebook about the US treatment of Muslims, according to the AP, citing a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\"If you want us Muslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks, then make peace\" with the Islamic State group, he allegedly wrote.\nRepresentative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the act was indicative of someone who may have been self-radicalised.\nMilitants of the so-called Islamic State have found recruits in the US Somali community in recent years.\nAbout a dozen young men and women from Minnesota's Somali community have travelled to Syria to join militant groups.\nNine men in Minnesota were sentenced on terror charges for plotting to join the Islamic State group.\nAnd a Somali-American man attacked 10 people with a knife at a central Minnesota mall before he was killed by an off-duty police officer in September.\nJaylani Hussein, the executive director of Council of American-Islamic Relations' Minnesota chapter, said some Somali-Americans were concerned about being viewed as \"guilty by association\".\nAfter Monday's attack, he said: \"We must not let the act of one individual, no matter what his motive or background, to further divide our community or our nation.\"\n [OUT] ",

If abandoning the 15% rise was entirely a decision for Surrey, was he misleading his councillors into thinking a deal with the government was still on the table, when it had been \"firmly rejected\" as the minister claimed today?\nWas David Hodge himself behind the release of embarrassing documents on Budget day? He certainly won't go down with a fight, even if it's with his own side.\nMPs heard comments from an email dated 9 January, in which Conservative MP Mr Lord wrote to Mr Hodge: \"Sajid led me to understand before Christmas that he would be trying very hard indeed to find Â£30 or Â£40m to help Surrey out with the worst of its (government-dictated) financial dilemma.\n\"I am extremely unimpressed that he has not come up with the goods.\"\nHe also wrote: \"If all his local government settlement money is really allocated... if the Treasury really is refusing to help out... and if he can't find a pot of money for the 'missing' learning disability grant...then Saj still has the option of adjusting all other council settlements down very slightly in order to accommodate the Â£31m needed for Surrey - and I think he should be encouraged to do this.\"\n [OUT] ",

It represented an early step in a long parliamentary process which will see the details of the measures scrutinised at greater length over the coming months.\nShadow home secretary Andy Burnham said Labour would work constructively with Mrs May to get the legislation through Parliament but that \"substantial changes\" were needed to ensure the right balance \"between collective security and individual privacy in the digital age\".\nLabour abstained at second reading and will be seeking amendments including a specific \"presumption of privacy\".\n\"We need new legislation but this bill is not yet good enough,\" he said. \"Simply to block this legislation would, in my view, be irresponsible. It would leave the police and security services in limbo... We must give them the tools to do the job.\"\nThe proposals have already been significantly amended after a draft bill last year was heavily criticised by three parliamentary committees.\nThe government may be forced to give further ground if it is to get the law on to the statute book by the end of the year as it wants, although it is not expected to meet significant resistance until the bill reaches report stage and then goes to the House of Lords.\nMr Burnham called for the use of surveillance powers to be limited to more serious investigations and for greater clarity on who can use them.\nHe said he did not see why agencies such as the Gambling Commission or the Food Standards Agency should have access to people's internet records, and said he would be calling on Mrs May to \"severely reduce\" the list of agencies who would get the new powers.\nHe also called for an independent review of \"bulk powers\" - the sweeping up of vast quantities of internet data and the collection of personal information from databases by the security services.\n\"I want a bill that helps the authorities do their job but protects ordinary people from intrusion and abuse from those in positions of power,\" he added.\nMrs May has said Britain's spies must continue to be allowed to hack into foreign computer networks, under so-called \"bulk equipment interference warrants\", as this was \"a key operational requirement for GCHQ\".\nShe told MPs that bulk powers had played a significant role in every major counter-terrorism investigation over the past decade, including seven terror plots foiled in the past 18 months, and in responding to the bulk of cyber attacks against UK interests.\nOperational requests for such information, she said, would have to be approved by a judge as well as the minister responsible under a regime of \"robust and consistent safeguards\".\nBut Conservative MP Owen Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said elected politicians accountable to Parliament and the public should be exclusively responsible for granting warrants.\nThe SNP said they were in favour of \"targeted surveillance\" but many of the powers being sought were of \"dubious legality\".\n\"We will work with others to try and amend the bill extensively,\" Joanna Cherry, the party's home affairs spokeswoman, said. \"If the bill is not amended to our satisfaction, we reserve the right to vote it down at a later stage.\"\nThe Lib Dems blocked Mrs May's previous attempt to legislate in this area, which was dubbed \"the snoopers' charter\", when they were part of the coalition government.\nSpeaking in the debate, former leader Nick Clegg said the bill was an improvement on previous proposals but was \"not in a fit state\" - telling MPs that it was still predicated on a \"dragnet approach\" to data retention and the powers it sought to grant were \"formidable and capable of misuse\".\n\"The implications of this are very big indeed,\" he said.\n\"It is that the government believes as a matter of principle that every innocent act of communication online must leave a trace for future possible interrogation by the state. No other country in the world feels the need to do this apart from Russia.\"\nUKIP MEP Steven Woolfe told the BBC's Daily Politics he was \"deeply concerned\" by the Investigatory Powers Bill, saying it \"could put us into an extreme position of monitoring our citizens\".\nEdward Snowden, the former CIA analyst turned surveillance whistleblower, said he was closely following Tuesday's debate. He tweeted: \"Britons, note how your MPs vote today on IPBill. A vote in favour, or abstention, is a vote against you. \"\nAnd Amnesty International warned that \"wide-ranging snooping powers\" were being rushed through parliament at \"break-neck speed\".\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Amanda Lundeteg, already a chief executive aged just 32, is in one way a poster girl for gender equality in the Swedish workplace.\nShe holds a degree in Business Economics, started her career in banking and has already served on three different boards.\nYet the sole reason Allbright, the non-profit company she manages, exists is to expose the limitations in career opportunities for women in Sweden.\nDespite giving fathers the right to take paid time off since the 1970s and one of the world's most generous parental leave packages (currently 480 tax-funded days to share between a couple) and heavily subsidized day care (capped at some $145 a month) Ms Lundeteg argues Sweden is less progressive than many might think.\n\"We're really good at bragging about how good we are... but if you ask most women in Sweden I definitely don't think that they are satisfied.\"\nOn the plus side, more than 80% of mothers work and Sweden leads the industrialised world in terms of public sector gender equality, according to the OECD; but Allbright's research shows the private sector - and the rapidly growing startup scene - is struggling to keep up.\nIn 2016, more than 80% of managers at listed Swedish companies were men and not a single new business on the stock market had a woman boss.\nThe main reason for this imbalance is that traditional gender stereotypes prevail, despite decades of legislation designed to even things out, says Ms Lundeteg.\n\"It's possible to live a gender-equal life in Sweden, but we don't do it because of traditions.\n\"As a man you're supposed to be the one who works and brings home the meat to the cave. It's about stereotypes and privileges that will take time to break down.\"\nFigures from Statistics Sweden confirm that women still take more than 80% of a couple's parental leave while their first child is under the age of two.\nWomen also remain much more likely to work part-time than men. When it comes to equal pay for similar work, Sweden is close to the OECD average and drops to 35th place on the World Economic Forum's gender equality ranking.\nIt isn't difficult to find Swedes who are willing to talk about the discrepancies.\n\"There's still a lot of fathers who don't take their parental leave so it's not perfect yet,\" says Martin Hector, 32, as he takes his baby son for a stroll in Ralambshovs park in central Stockholm.\n\"Over the summer, for three months or something like that, feels the most common.\"\nHe's planning to take a total of nine months off work.\nCamilla Dath, a lawyer who is also braving unusually chilly May temperatures of 2C with her seven-month-old, is taking 11 months' leave and says her husband will take a similar period off work.\nBut other parents might not have the same opportunities, she argues, if one partner earns substantially more than the other or because they work in organisations with more old-fashioned  cultures.\n\"I have friends working in big law firms and they have a harder time to take parental leave,\" she says.\nWhen it comes to the number of women in management, the biggest discrepancies are still in  the traditionally \"male\" industries of manufacturing and technology.\nHowever, Allbright's research suggests that financial services and property companies have made \"significant\" improvements in recent years.\nRental accommodation firm Heba, for example, recently climbed 100 places in Allbright's rankings after replacing several of its top male executives, resulting in a female majority in management.\nHowever its chief executive, Lennart Karlsson, is candid enough to admit that reaching gender equality was not his original goal.\n\"I thought competence was the main thing - competence and attitude - not sex, but I've changed my mind. The workplace works better because of the [gender] mix,\" he says.\n\"The discussion climate is better, you have a better conversation and a better understanding for each other.\"\nAmanda Lundetag argues this should boost his business too, citing several recent studies including a high-profile report for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which concluded that there is a positive correlation between the presence of women in leadership roles and an organisation's performance.\nIt's a link that is definitely not lost on the Swedish politicians spearheading what they've described as \"the first feminist government in the world\".\nThe Nordic nation's Left-Green coalition pushed through a new law in 2015, aimed to encourage men to take a greater share of the parental leave. Ninety days are now reserved for fathers on a \"use it or lose\" it basis.\n\"What we want to see is an equal participation from the parents in the long run... but we also have to take it slowly so that families will be able to adapt to the changes,\" says Annika Strandhall, Sweden's Minister for Social Security.\nNext year will even see the launch of a new Gender Equality Authority, an admission, according to Ms Strandhall, that Sweden's world-famous feminist initiatives have not been as joined-up as they might have been.\nYet while creating equal opportunities for men and women appears largely hard-wired into the national psyche, Sweden is split on the extent to which the state should intervene to pick up the pace.\nThe government's attempt to introduce legislation that would fine listed companies which fail to appoint women to at least 40% of board seats was rejected by parliament in January.\nThe fear of potential penalties seems to have acted as a catalyst, though; 33% of those put forward for board seats so far in 2017 are women, up 2% on last year, says Allbright, putting Sweden behind only Norway and France, both of which have legally-binding quotas.\nHowever, the nationalist Sweden Democrats (currently the second-most popular party in the polls) and the smaller centre-right Christian Democrats -voted against the 90-day parental leave quota for fathers. They want families to have a greater choice when it comes to organising parenting.\n\"There is a societal pressure...  because everyone goes back to work. I felt I would be going against the norm if I had stayed at home,\" explains Simone French, a 46-year-old who is originally from Australia.\nShe says she would have welcomed the opportunity to stay at home until her son started school. Instead she ended up taking just a year off from her digital marketing career amid pressure from her employer and relatives.\n\"It was my maternal instinct to be with my son - every fibre in my being fought against going back. It's not really talked about here but I have actually met a couple of Swedish women who felt the same.\"\nHowever those cheerleading Sweden's march towards a completely gender equal society argue that evening out parental responsibilities is as much about giving fathers the same chance to bond with their children while they are young, as it is giving women greater opportunities to climb the ladder back in the workplace.\n\"You become closer with the children - a better connection,\" says Andreas Lundvick, 38, one of the other fathers back in Ralambshovs park.\nHe's taking time out from his job at a major Swedish bank to look after his six-month-old son while his wife is studying full-time, a move he believes will have \"no impact\" on his future career.\n\"I feel lucky, when you speak to people from other countries, and you hear about their situation, it's mostly the mum being home with the children. It's a culture thing.\"\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Mr Carter told CNN's State of the Union the Iraqis \"vastly outnumbered\" the IS forces but chose to withdraw.\nThe head of Iraq's defence and security committee said the comments were \"unrealistic and baseless\".\nThe Iraqi government has now deployed Shia militias to the area to try to halt the advance of IS.\nOn Saturday, the militiamen retook Husayba, east of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, with heavy fighting continuing in the area on Sunday.\nThe US has invested in a policy of training and arming the Iraqi forces since it withdrew its combat troops at the end of 2011.\nBut Iraqi forces have suffered a number of defeats at the hands of IS over the past year, leaving behind US-supplied materiel.\nMr Carter said of Ramadi: \"What apparently happened is the Iraqi forces just showed no will to fight. They were not outnumbered. In fact, they vastly outnumbered the opposing force.\"\nDescribing the situation as \"very concerning\", he added: \"We can give them training, we can give them equipment - we obviously can't give them the will to fight.\"\nMr Carter said the supply of training and equipment would continue, in the hope it would develop such a will.\nThe BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says the comments are a stinging assessment of the army the US has been training and will embolden critics who say the only way to defeat IS is to put American boots on the ground - something Washington has so far ruled out.\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the BBC's John Simpson he was \"surprised\" at the comments.\n\"[Mr Carter] was very supportive of Iraq and I am sure he was fed with the wrong information,\" he said.\nMr Abadi also insisted Ramadi could be taken back \"in days\".\nHakim al-Zamili, the head of Iraq's parliamentary defence and security committee, was more critical of Mr Carter.\nMr Zamili told Associated Press the US had failed to provide \"good equipment, weapons and aerial support\" at Ramadi and was seeking to \"throw the blame on somebody else\".\nMr Carter defended the US policy of carrying out air strikes in support of Iraqi ground forces and said the ultimate defeat of IS would depend on the Iraqi people.\nHe said: \"We can participate in the defeat of IS. But we can't make Iraq... a decent place for people to live. We can't sustain the victory, only the Iraqis can do that. And, in particular in this case, the Sunni tribes to the west.\"\nAnbar province, which is predominantly Sunni, covers a vast stretch of the country west from Baghdad to the Syrian border, and contains key roads that link Iraq to both Syria and Jordan.\nThe fall of Ramadi, just 110km (70 miles) west of Baghdad, was seen as a major embarrassment for the government. Thousands of civilians fled.\nThe US believes the Iraqis left behind tanks, artillery pieces, armoured personnel carriers and Humvees.\nThe deployment of the Shia militiamen to the Sunni province has sparked sectarian fears.\nIn addition to Ramadi, this week IS militants also seized the last Syrian government-controlled border crossing with Iraq and, in Syria itself, the ancient city of Palmyra.\nSome observers said IS now controls 50% of Syria's entire territory - as well as a third of Iraq.\nSyrian state media said on Sunday that IS had killed at least 400 people, including women and children, in Palmyra since taking it over, but this has not been independently confirmed.\n [OUT] ",

Russia backs President Assad and hosted him on Tuesday in a visit criticised by the US.\nRussia has been bombing targets in Syria since last month. It says it is primarily hitting IS, but Western powers say most of the air strikes have hit rebel groups, including those backed by the West and Gulf states.\nHowever, Vladimir Putin's spokesman said on the BBC's HARDtalk programme that Russia's intervention in Syria was not an attempt to prop up President Assad but rather an attempt to save the country and the region from falling under the sway of terrorists.\nDmitry Peskov said a political settlement was impossible without dialogue with the \"legitimate president\" of Syria.\nAnd he echoed Mr Putin's speech at the Valdai discussion forum by saying all the \"serious\" rebel forces in Syria were \"terrorists\".\nMr Peskov said the West had so far failed to identify any \"balanced opposition\" to Mr Assad that did not have links to jihadists.\nThe US-led air campaign against the so-called Islamic State had led to IS controlling two-thirds of the country's territory, Mr Peskov argued, but there were now signs the Syrian army - backed by Russian air strikes - was mounting a successful offensive against rebels.\nMr Peskov also said Russia wanted to exchange military information with the US, including about targets of air strikes, but this had not been forthcoming.\nYouTube video from the fighting in Syria has thrown up images of a rarely seen Russian weapons system - the TOS-1 \"Buratino\" multiple rocket launcher.\nDescribed by the Russians as a \"heavy flame-thrower\", it is a highly controversial weapon and its appearance in Syria raises the question as to who is actually operating it.\nThe TOS-1 fires a 220mm rocket that is designed to carry a thermobaric warhead. Sometimes known as a \"fuel-air explosive\" the rockets detonates at a set altitude above the ground, releasing a cloud of fuel which is then ignited by a second explosion.\nThis creates a huge temperature and pressure wave whose impact has been likened to a low-yield nuclear explosive.\nIt is very much an indiscriminate weapon, typically used to support offensive operations by blanketing given areas with fire. Thermobaric weapons were used to devastating effect by the Russians in Afghanistan.\nWhy is there a war in Syria?\nAnti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.\nWho is fighting whom?\nGovernment forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, as well as less numerous so-called \"moderate\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other.\nWhat's the human cost?\nMore than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe.\nHow has the world reacted?\nIran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes.\n [OUT] ",

On Tuesday, it revised the figure to 125 messages.\nOne of the emails - sent in November 2013 by Mrs Clinton's then foreign policy adviser Jacob Sullivan - was published heavily redacted and marked classified until 2025.\nMr Sullivan, who is now a policy adviser for Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign, forwarded her boss the email with the subject line: \"No go on Burma (Myanmar) travel.\"\nIn another email - from September 2010 - Britain's David Miliband admitted that losing the Labour leadership race to Ed Miliband was \"tough\", adding: \"When it's your brother...\"\nState department spokesman Mark Toner was quoted by AFP as saying the process of re-evaluating the remaining unreleased emails was continuing.\nThe emails were not marked as classified at the time Mrs Clinton sent or received them. The vast majority of the correspondence concerned mundane matters of daily life at workplace, including phone messages and relays of daily schedules.\nOne particular email eliciting laughs among the US political reporter set is an email about Gefilte fish, a traditional Jewish food eaten on the holiday Passover.\nThe Washington Post explains that the Gefilte fish email was about a shipment of the product to Israel from the US Mrs Clinton was trying to save from a high tax.\nMany of the emails show the influence of Sidney Blumenthal, an outside Clinton adviser. In one email, Mr Blumenthal describes former UK Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg as having \"misplayed almost every turn\" and being full of \"inbred arrogance.\"\nAssociated Press says the emails revealed that Mrs Clinton and her aides were acutely aware of the need to protect sensitive information.\nIt says Mrs Clinton also expressed frustration with the state department's treatment of certain ordinary documents as classified.\nIn one email, a state department IT staffer is trying to determine why Mrs Clinton's non-governmental email is bouncing back.\nMore than a quarter of Mrs Clinton's work emails have now been released, after she provided the state department with 30,000 pages of documents last year.\nPolls indicate that the email scandal has affected Mrs Clinton's ratings, though she remains the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.\nAt this point the novelty of peering into Hillary Clinton's email correspondence is starting to wear off for the general public. Although the former secretary of state's attempts to explain why she used of a private email server have damaged her political standing, the steady release of her electronic missives has faded into the background noise of the presidential campaign.\nThere may yet be some scandalous message lurking in the trove of yet-to-be-released messages, but given the fact that the files were screened by Mrs Clinton or her staff, that seems unlikely.\nMrs Clinton says the primary reason she set up her own email was for \"convenience\" but sceptics say the real reason she did it was because it gave her total control over her correspondence.\nAccording to Mrs Clinton, she sent or received 62,320 emails during her time as secretary of state - she says half of them were official and have been turned over to the state department.\nProbably not. Mrs Clinton's email system existed in a grey area of the law - and one that has been changed several times since she left office.\nIt's a big deal because Mrs Clinton is asking the US public to trust that she is complying with both the \"letter and the spirit of the rules\". Critics on the left and the right are concerned she made her communications on sensitive national security issues more susceptible to hackers and foreign intelligence services.\n [OUT] ",

Here, we examine the complicated catalogue of events.\nHow did it start?\nOn November 22, there were signs that Sony's computer system had been compromised when skulls appeared on employees' screens with a message threatening to expose \"secrets\" from data obtained in a sophisticated hack.\nThis initially caused crippling computer problems for workers at Sony, who were forced to work with pen and paper. \"We even fired up our fax machine,\" one employee told the LA Times.\nSony initially said they were dealing with an \"IT matter\", but later acknowledged the hack to staff, calling it a \"brazen attack\" comprised of \"malicious criminal acts\".\nWho is responsible?\nA unknown group calling itself #GOP - later identified as Guardians of Peace - claimed it was behind the cyber attack, prompting the FBI to launch an investigation. Their name has been attached to subsequent leaks of information.\nSpeculation has since mounted that North Korea may have had a hand in the attack as a form of retaliation for Sony's release of The Interview.\nA North Korean foreign ministry spokesman called the movie an \"act of terrorism\" in June, promising \"merciless\" retaliation if it was released.\nThe country eventually denied involvement, but heaped praise on the hack, calling it a \"righteous deed\". The secretive nation's ability to wage cyber warfare is not unknown, but it has not previously used the name Guardians of Peace.\nNews network Bloomberg has reported that the perpetrators worked from a hotel in Thailand, while unnamed Sony executives told TMZ the hackers were helped by insiders who knew where the most embarrassing information could be found. US media quoted anonymous officials as saying that the FBI had linked North Korea to the attacks.\nWhy was the release of The Interview pulled?\nThe fallout from the hack escalated after the \"Guardians of Peace\" claimed they would attack cinemas showing the Sony film. They alluded to 9/11 in their message and said it was a response to the \"greed of Sony Pictures\".\nThe film's New York premiere was cancelled and cinema chains cancelled screenings, leading Sony to announce that it had \"decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release\".\nHowever the decision has been greeted with incredulity by some in Hollywood.\n\"Wow. Everyone caved,\" actor Rob Lowe wrote on Twitter. \"The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow.\"\nComedian Jimmy Kimmel tweeted that the decision by theatres to refuse to show the film was \"an un-American act of cowardice that validates terrorist actions and sets a terrifying precedent.\"\nOn 23 December, Sony announced that the film would have a limited theatrical release and be made available for download.\nWhat did the hackers steal?\nBefore the controversy around The Interview, reams of data considered confidential by Sony - and some of the company's prime assets - were stolen in the hack.\nAn early version of a script for the next James Bond movie, Spectre, was leaked but failed to halt production.\nFive Sony films, including the new and unreleased version of Annie, turned up on illegal file-sharing sites and were downloaded up to a million times. Brad Pitt's Fury, which had already hit cinema screens, was also shared.\nWhat information has been revealed?\nA whole host of Sony's private company information has apparently been exposed to the public, including bosses' salaries and employees' social security information.\nStrings of confidential emails between Sony workers have also been circulated and proved to be the most sensitive and embarrassing leaks.\nThe emails revealed that:\nSony has contacted some media outlets asking them to exercise caution over the leaked material they report on.\nHow did Hollywood respond?\nA-listers at the heart of the revelations have maintained a dignified silence.\nBut screenwriter and producer Aaron Sorkin wrote in the New York Times of his anger at the hack, accusing the media of aiding and abetting the cyber criminals by sifting through the leaked information and reporting the most salacious findings. He hit out at Hollywood for doing little to protect the dignity of Sony employees, whose personal data has been stolen.\nJames Franco and Seth Rogen, stars of The Interview, have also commented publicly on the hack, using colourful language on US \"shock jock\" Howard Stern's show to refer to the \"stolen information\", adding that its circulation is \"doing exactly what these criminals want\".\nWhen Sony relented and released the film, Rogen, who also wrote and directed The Interview, said: \"I'm so grateful that the movie found its way into theatres, and I'm thrilled that people actually went out and saw it.\"\n [OUT] ",

These are the experiences that make us stronger,\" says Chris.\nGabby adds: \"When I was watching him at the Olympics I didn't think of me not going, In that moment I was so proud.\"\n\"I'm obsessed with him,\" Gabby beams, and a quick scan of her Twitter feed confirms the statement.\nCuddled together in picture after picture, a cute couple with love in their eyes - only it is not Chris with Gabby but Bowser, their pet dog.\nYet with tournaments in destinations like Kuala Lumpar, Jakata and Dubai, it means being away from home for large periods of time - not an ideal situation when the other person that cares for your pet is travelling with you.\n\"It's the most illogical thing we've ever done,\" says Chris. \"We travel together so don't miss each other. The biggest thing we miss is Bowser.\"\n\"Chris' dad was so against it,\" adds Gabby, whose parents look after Bowser when they are abroad.\n\"He is worth every second,\" says Chris. \"He's such a release for us. When you get home from training, he greets us with a squeak and brings you straight back to normal life.\"\nAs they are a pair that needs to work together for an end goal, psychology is pivotal in ironing out underlying tensions.\nFor Gabby and Chris, those tensions might not actually be on the court, but stem from their personal relationship.\nTheir go-to guy is Simon Drane - sports psychologist turned marriage councillor.\n\"I always say we have couples therapy,\" jokes Gabby. \"He's the nicest guy and we meet up regularly as a friend.\"\nSo close is their relationship that upon sitting with Drane for the first time since reuniting as a pair at the end of 2012, the two decided to have some fun.\n\"I said Gabby and I were having a bit of an issue,\" recalls Chris. \"Simon was rubbing his hands that he'd have something to work with.\n\"I said that Gabby hates it when she's in the shower and then I go on the toilet. His mouth just dropped and he must have wondered what he'd go himself into.\n\"We waited a few seconds whilst he stumbled for words and then burst out laughing.\"\nWith matching wedding date tattoos, the two are not adverse to a little body modification.\nMore recently, Chris went a step further adding a half-sleeve on his left arm, complete with lion, roses and Commonwealth medal.\nHowever, Chris played his most recent tournament in a sleeveless top - and had forgotten to inform two people in particular about his tattoo.\n\"He didn't tell his parents,\" Gabby says.\n\"They watch the live streaming and I said to Chris they're going to find out.\"\nChris adds: \"I got a text from mum saying 'Christopher'.\n\"That's when I know I'm in trouble. 'What is that on your arm. I hope you're stopping there.'\nChris has the Olympic rings adorning his body and Gabby now hopes to match her husband having missed out on London 2012.\n\"They are very addictive,\" she said.\n\"Having missed the first one, it's important to me. I won't get the rings before Rio though.\"\nBeing two of the best badminton players in the world, you would imagine Chris and Gabby were handy at physical education at school.\nWhilst Gabby takes great pride in her A* at GCSE, she takes even greater pleasure from beating Chris, who scored zero on his practical exam.\n\"I got a B,\" he says. \"But I did break my leg when I was doing my GCSEs playing badminton.\n\"When the school came to give my practical, they said we'll give you a 10 as you're European champion. The exam board wouldn't accept it because they hadn't seen me play.\"\nGabby adds: \"Still got a B.\"\n [OUT] ",

It is probably the most important trial result of a cholesterol lowering drug in over 20 years.\"\nThe findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and also reported at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology.\nThe study showed that one heart attack or stroke was prevented for every 74 patients taking the drug in the two-year trial.\nIt is too soon to know if the drug is saving lives.\nEvolocumab is an antibody just like the weapons used by the immune system to fight infection.\nHowever, it has been designed to target a protein in the liver with the name PCSK9.\nAnd ultimately it makes the organ better at whipping bad cholesterol out of the blood and breaking it down.\nOther trials have shown such antibodies have cut bad cholesterol levels by 60% and Amgen is not the only company looking at this approach.\nThe antibody is given by injection into the skin every two to four weeks.\nHowever, Prof Sever said: \"They will probably not [replace statins], there are an awful lot of people with really quite high cholesterol out there and we'll probably need more than one drug to get their levels down.\"\nThe cost varies, but it is thought to cost the UK's NHS about ÃÂ£2,000 per year per patient where it is already being given to people who do not respond to statins.\nProf Sir Nilesh Samani, the medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"This trial is a significant advance.\n\"However, the trial was stopped early after only 2.2 years of average follow-up and therefore it is difficult to be certain about the actual extent of the longer term benefit, including the impact on dying from heart disease, as well as longer term safety.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The tourists may have won the second Test at Westpac Stadium, and there may be a climatic decider to come, but the post-match debate must start by looking back at the actions of one All Black - Sonny Bill Williams.\nWilliams, the All Blacks' star centre, chased up a kick and ran into contact midway through the first half, with his collision with Anthony Watson initially looking pretty innocuous.\nThe first clue that it was more serious was the reaction of the Lions players, with Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray both protesting to referee Jerome Garces.\nThen when the incident was replayed in slow motion, there was no doubt.\nWilliams led with a shoulder into Watson's unprotected face, not making any effort to wrap his arms around the Lions wing.\nWorld Rugby has been clear on this. It changed the rules in January to make the head \"a no-go area\", warning that any player making above-the-shoulder contact risks a red card.\nIt was undoubtedly \"reckless\" rather than \"accidental\" and, considering the force and Watson's vulnerability, the red card was fully warranted.\nI don't think it was malicious, Williams does not seem the sort of player to attempt to hurt another.\nBut the laws don't allow any wriggle room on those grounds.\nWorld Rugby is trying to get the game to be as clean as possible and is asking the players to make smarter decisions rather than just throwing themselves into a collision in an uncontrolled way.\nGarces took his time, consulted his assistants and reached the correct decision. It was undoubtedly a huge factor in the result.\nAt the top level, there have been a few examples of teams triumphing when down a man. Racing 92 beat Toulon in the 2016 Top 14 final after having Maxime Machenaud sent off in the first half. England did the same against Argentina in November after Elliot Daly had been shown red.\nBut it put the hosts at a huge disadvantage, with another 65 minutes to play.\nWould the Lions have won against a full-strength All Blacks side? It's impossible to say, a complete hypothetical.\nAnd the Lions players won't care a jot.\nThat is because if you ask any player in world rugby what sort of victory they would take over the All Blacks, especially in New Zealand, they will take it any way they can get it.\nThe two teams' reaction to the All Blacks going down to 14 men was markedly different.\nNew Zealand reacted quicker and more clearly to a curveball that neither Lions coach Warren Gatland nor All Blacks counterpart Steve Hansen could have prepared for.\nThey threw down the gauntlet in the pack and backed themselves to contain the Lions, with Jerome Kaino withdrawn and only seven forwards on the pitch.\nIn the backs, they introduced Ngani Laumape, who was direct, forceful and recreated some of that go-forward that went off with Williams.\nBack up to a full complement in the backline, they could deny the Lions the space the tourists wanted out wide as well.\nWhat will frustrate Gatland is that the Lions could not get any control of the game after the red card.\nThere were too many errors and too much indiscipline, with the Lions leaking costly penalties under little pressure.\nYou can understand a player giving away a penalty because they think doing so is the lesser of two evils and not infringing might allow the other team to score a try.\nBut these were needless penalties to give the All Blacks a hold of the scoreboard.\nIt was level when Williams was sent off after 25 minutes, but after an hour the All Blacks had ground out a 18-9 lead.\nThe most high-profile offender during this period was prop Mako Vunipola.\nHe gave away a penalty with an clumsy charge into Beauden Barrett and, just a few minutes later, earned a yellow card for an unnecessary clear-out on the prone Kiwi fly-half.\nAdd in his occasional wobbles at scrum time against Owen Franks and it won't be a performance he looks back on with any pride.\nGiven the England man's skills in the loose, it would go against the way that the Lions want to play to drop Vunipola. But people have been left out for less in other teams.\nHe won't be feeling that certain of a third Test start.\nThe big talking point before kick-off was Gatland's selection of Owen Farrell at 12 to provide a second playmaking option alongside Johnny Sexton at fly-half.\nUltimately, on balance, that selection was justified.\nFarrell and Sexton do not knock people back and the All Blacks made yardage down that 10-12 channel.\nBut that vulnerability is the price you pay for having the two best readers of the game on the pitch at the same time and sharpening the tourists' attacking edge.\nTheir runaround play - combined with quick hands from Elliot Daly and Liam Williams - sprung Anthony Watson down the right wing before they cannily used the space created on the opposite side to put Taulupe Faletau in.\nFor Conor Murray's score, it was a deft pop from Sexton to put Jamie George into space and a crafty clear-out of TJ Perenara from Farrell to open the way to the line for the scrum-half.\nWould those chances have been created and then taken without them both on the pitch? It's unlikely.\nThe Lions have an explosive back three, and Sexton and Farrell are the best equipped to ensure them a diet of fast, good ball.\nThe first place that the Lions coaching staff wanted to see improvement on last weekend's defeat was up front in the close quarters.\nIn the first Test, the tourists were knocked back too often.\nThis time the gain line was not continually breached by the All Blacks one-out runners. There were bigger hits by the Lions today, which made the breakdown more competitive.\nDefence coach Andy Farrell called on his players to \"man up\" and no-one responded better to that than Sean O'Brien.\nThe flanker carried with purpose, racking up a team-high nine, and tackled offensively, backed up by a more physical display by Sam Warburton and Faletau alongside him in the back row.\nMaro Itoje was right there alongside them.\nHe dropped the ball on his first carry and gave away a couple of sloppy penalties, but added dynamism, making a huge contribution around the pitch.\nAdd in the fact that he took over the line-out calling duties from the dropped George Kruis and oversaw an 80% return from that set-piece on the Lions' throw, and it was a near man-of-the-match performance.\nNow the anticipation grows to see what next weekend will bring.\n [OUT] ",

Adding overhead electric gantries to the route through Bath, Box Tunnel and the West Country landscape has proved vastly more complex than anticipated.\nEven when the project was first proposed in 2014, Network Rail's chief executive described the plans as \"unrealistic\". Since then, costs have spiralled and passengers still have no idea when electric trains will run.\nIronically, the new trains themselves are on schedule and on budget, raising the prospect of electric trains arriving with no track to run on.\nFortunately for the rail authorities, the new rolling stock is a hybrid, using diesel where the track is not electrified. That is now looking like a useful design feature.\nCommittee chairman Meg Hillier said: \"Network Rail has lost its grip on managing large infrastructure projects.\n\"The result is a twofold blow to taxpayers: delays in the delivery of promised improvements and a vastly bigger bill for delivering them.\"\nShe questioned whether the ORR was \"fit for purpose\" and said five-year funding cycles should not be used for major projects.\nAn ORR spokesman said escalating costs and delays were \"unacceptable\" and agreed a review of its role was \"appropriate\" following changes to Network Rail's ownership and finances.\n\"We need to learn the lessons, and agree with PAC's recommendations that uncertainties in key projects need to be addressed differently.\"\nA Network Rail spokesman said it was clear the industry had been \"overly ambitious\" about what could be achieved with the money available.\n\"Network Rail has successfully delivered over 5,000 projects over the past five years, but our understanding of how best to plan and deliver major new electrification schemes was not good enough.\n\"We have now made significant changes to the way we plan and deliver our investment programme, which will see schemes progress only once they are sufficiently developed that a reliable cost estimate can be established.\"\nHe added that electrifying the Great Western Main Line was \"extremely complex\" on an operational railway and trying to minimise disruption to \"line-side\" neighbours had increased costs.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Now with oil at a 12 year low, below $30 a barrel, how can airlines possibly be hitting passengers with a surcharge for jet fuel?\nThe point is they aren't.\nBut before you crack open the champagne and book a quick flight off to the Maldives - those surcharges haven't gone away.\nThey're just not for fuel any more. They're for - well it's not quite clear what they are for, apart from maintaining profit margins at the airlines.\nTo recap: the surcharges were introduced as a way for the airlines to distance themselves from the rising cost of oil, in the same way that they itemised government taxes on their bills.\nTravel writer Simon Calder explains: \"It was a way for the airline to say \"this is nothing to do with us - don't blame us for the price rises\".\nEven when oil prices began to fall, for a while fuel surcharges were still acceptable because the airlines had hedged, buying much of that oil when the price was high.\n\"And let's not forget the oil price is paid in dollars and the dollar has been very strong over the last year,\" he adds.\nThat has meant that savings have been slow to come through. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reckons the final hedges which locked airlines into higher than market oil prices will unwind by mid-2016.\nEven so, as the oil price raced downwards, the surcharge became virtually impossible to defend.\nAnd, more important, the regulators were not going to let the airlines hoodwink their passengers.\nIn 2012 the US Department of Transportation had ruled: \"When a cost component is described as a fuel surcharge â¦ that amount must actually reflect a reasonable estimate of the per-passenger fuel costs incurred by the carrier\".\nSo bit by bit the fuel surcharge has disappeared.\nHas that meant fares have come down?\nIATA's chief economist Brian Pearce says: \"In 2015 air ticket prices on average still fell by around 5% (adjusted for exchange rate changes) and we expect similar reductions in 2016.\n\"That's a substantial reduction because at the same time airlines are seeing the costs like labour and airport charges going up.\"\nBut the interesting point is how the airlines have removed the surcharge.\nSome airlines like Qantas and Virgin Australia did get rid of it altogether and absorbed it into their basic fare early last year.\nMany of the budget airlines, such as Ryanair, boasted that they never had a fuel surcharge in the first place.\nA few held on to it, most notably in Japan where it is strictly regulated, and accurately reflects the falling cost.\nSo the fuel surcharge for a JAL flight from Japan to Korea at the beginning of 2015 stood at 1,000 yen (Â£5.80; $8.40). A year later and it has sunk to 300 yen.\nBut many of the other airlines simply removed the fuel surcharge and replaced it with something different, often described as a \"carrier imposed surcharge\".\nWhat that means is not exactly clear.\nFor instance BA's explanation of the charge is as follows: \"Carrier imposed charges were introduced in October last year in response to a variety of factors.\n\"These include changing industry practices and to be consistent with changes that have been in place for flights originating in the USA for a number of years.\"\nLufthansa is slightly more illuminating. It introduced an \"international surcharge\" in 2014.  Spokesman Boris Ogursky says: \"The surcharge covers costs beyond our control such as air traffic control fees, emissions trading scheme payments and so on.\n\"It is important for the customer to compare the overall cost of the flight with other airlines. The total fare is steered by market competition - it's not just us making up surcharges and putting them up and down as we like.\n\"It is a highly competitive marketplace.\"\nIn some respects the name of the surcharge is irrelevant. As Simon Calder says: \"You could call it a uniform charge if you want, and you can say it's to cover the cost of uniforms, it matters not a jot.\n\"It is just another way of charging the passenger.\"\nHowever, it does matter to frequent flyers. In general, frequent flyer points can only be redeemed in exchange for basic fares. Surcharges and government taxes, with some exceptions, have to be paid for with cash.\nSo, by framing a large chunk of the fare as a surcharge, airlines can protect that income from discounts and loyalty scheme claims.\nThe bottom line could come as a bit of a shock to a frequent flyer eagerly queuing up to redeem points to buy a British Airways round trip to New York, say.\nIf they leave early this Saturday and come back on Wednesday, they will be faced with a total fare of Â£523.55.\nOf that Â£155 is government taxes. No chance the frequent flyer points (known as Avios to BA customers) will pay for that.\nÂ£163 of the fare is the carrier imposed surcharge. The points won't pay for that either - unless there is a special offer available.\nIn the end the points will pay for just Â£205 of the Â£523.55 fare. The frequent flyer (not the points) ends up paying the rest.\n [OUT] ",

There is the unbeaten colt Brother Bear, who is likely to line up as favourite in Tuesday's Coventry Stakes, and Alpha Centauri - also unbeaten and also a strong fancy - in the Albany Stakes on Friday.\nIn between, Torcedor, who has two wins from two starts since the joining Harrington stable, looks to add another of racing's very shiniest pots to the tally in the Gold Cup.\nWhile the team from Moone are out to make hay while the sun shines, so are their Irish compatriots, all looking to improve on a record 10 successes in 2016.\nAidan O'Brien will be in the spotlight the most, with well-fancied contender after well-fancied contender.\nHis Caravaggio is rated something of a banker in the Commonwealth Cup on Friday, although there looks to be a corker of a showdown in Tuesday's St James' Palace Stakes between Churchill, winner of the Newmarket and Irish 2000 Guineas, and Barney Roy and Thunder Snow, the two runners-up.\nThe scriptwriters making a film about the life of Australian jockey Michelle Payne may be chewing on their pens as they watch her first Royal Ascot mount Kaspersky in action.\nThey already have a terrific story to tell of the first female rider to win the horse race that 'stops a nation', the Melbourne Cup, on board 100-1 shot Prince Of Penzance in 2015.\nActor Rachel Griffiths - of Muriel's Wedding fame - is set to direct the movie, which she has described as a \"classic tale of the underdog\".\nWere the Jane Chapple-Hyam-trained Kaspersky to defy his outsider odds to beat Ribchester and company in the fixture's opener, Tuesday's Queen Anne Stakes, alterations to the planned screenplay would follow.\nPayne said: \"It's been crazy since I won the Melbourne Cup, and I can hardly believe I'm about to take part at such a prestigious event.\n\"The horse is in fantastic order, he's a quality galloper and if he's in good shape, you never know.\"\nPayne, 31, will be hoping for a smoother passage during the race than she found travelling to the UK: had Kaspersky not been Australian-owned, tough immigration rules might well have barred her way.\nThe date of 16 June 2009, the first afternoon of that year's Royal Ascot, is highly significant in the fixture's long and colourful history.\nOn that day, the Wesley A Ward-trained two-year-old Strike The Tiger led all the way and held on by a neck to win the Windsor Castle Stakes. It gave the USA its first win at British flat racing's summer highlight.\nWard, based between stables in California and Florida, struck again the very next day with another front-running juvenile, Jealous Again, in the Queen Mary Stakes.\nThough it is perhaps an overstatement to say a flood of runners has followed, it has certainly become a steady stream as Royal Ascot added another string to its international bow, and that despite the much tougher drugs laws in Europe.\nThis time, five American trainers are expected to field a total of 14 runners, with Ward producing the biggest squad as he hopes to improve on a record of seven Royal Ascot wins - all bar one in races for two-year-olds.\nThe interest will be reflected in the television coverage too. For the first time, American broadcaster NBC will have a daily show covering the races.\nWard nominates the filly Happy Like A Fool - named after a lyric from the OneRepublic song Good Life - as the best chance of victory among his well-developed two-year-olds, and she will run in the Queen Mary Stakes on Wednesday.\nBut it is a previous Queen Mary winner, the brilliant Lady Aurelia, whose appearance in Tuesday's King's Stand Stakes is most anticipated.\nWard said: \"She's a world-class sprinter.\"\nThe diplomatic crisis between Qatar and much of the rest of the Middle East, which has seen the closure of the oil and gas-rich state's sole border, with Saudi Arabia, may seem a world away from Royal Ascot.\nHowever, with Qatar's ever-growing influence in a sport long dominated by the Maktoums, the ruling family of near-neighbours Dubai, there will be plenty of reminders of that tension.\nThe extra dynamic will be evident from the very first race of the week, the Queen Anne Stakes, when Ribchester, owned by Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum's Godolphin operation, faces Qatar Racing's Lightning Spear.\nRacing speculation has surrounded what might happen come the presentations were one grouping or the other, both of whom are extensive sponsors, to win a race backed by their rival.\nThe races at Royal Ascot have no direct race sponsorship, avoiding potential embarrassment, though the top owner and leading trainer awards - for which the Godolphin team will be fancied - have the support of Qatari investment giant QIPCO.\nWith a long list of fancied Coolmore-owned and bred runners, Aidan O'Brien is odds-on favourite to be top trainer, ahead of John Gosden.\nHowever, Sir Michael Stoute should never be underestimated. It is 40 years exactly since Stoute won the first of his 75 Royal Ascot trophies, when Etienne Gerard took the Jersey Stakes.\nMost of O'Brien's leading hopes will be ridden by Ryan Moore, the favourite to be top jockey, though equalling his own record of nine wins in 2015 will be challenging.\nFrankie Dettori was expected to figure prominently too before injury forced his withdrawal, but the most in-form rider going into this year's Â£6.665m meeting is Brazil-born former champion Silvestre de Sousa.\nIn the words of The Kinks, officials at Royal Ascot have demonstrated themselves \"dedicated followers of fashion\".\nFor 2017, changes to the exacting dress code have been sanctioned, and, for the first time, women in jumpsuits will be admitted to the Royal Enclosure.\nHowever, alongside dresses and skirts \"of a modest length\" and headpieces \"with a base of four inches or more in diameter\", fashionistas will have to take care that their one-piece outfits are \"full-length to the ground\".\nOne official said: \"It's like trouser suits in the 1970s, fashions change.\"\nFor the record, spaghetti straps, fascinators and bare midriffs remain barred.\nFor guys, it is so much less complicated: top hat and tails - black or grey - continue to be de rigeur, as do black shoes.\n [OUT] ",

You've got to be sure you're doing it for the right reason.\"\nWhen he started working on the script in 2014, the starting point was how much the world had changed since Bourne's last outing.  Back then George Bush was US president and the Iraq war was in progress.\nSince then, Greengrass notes,  there has been a global financial crisis and the rise of smartphones, social media, electronic surveillance and cyber-intelligence. \"We had to try and craft a story with Bourne in that landscape,\" he says.\nA key theme in the film is the relationship between personal privacy and state security - there's a direct reference in the screenplay to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, and the plot involves a social network, Deep Dream, that pledges never to share its users' data.  A bold claim, perhaps, in this digital age.\nGreengrass and Damon had last worked together on Greengrass's Iraq war thriller Green Zone in 2010.  So how does Greengrass describe his relationship with the actor after making their fourth film together?\n\"He's a close friend,\" Greengrass replies. \"I have great trust in him as a person and as an actor. Making movies is both entirely ludicrous and incredibly hard. It's a preposterous way to spend your time.\n\"You give up a lot for the privilege of doing it and one of the things you get are relationships of immense trust that you see forged in situations of immense stress.\"\nWarming to his theme, the director adds: \"It's a circus life, the movies. It's a lot of travelling, a lot of antisocial hours, there's a lot of it that's about escaping from life.\n\"I have a vivid memory of Matt saying, 'I've given my life for this and I love it.'  I was really struck by that simple statement of fact. It was like somebody saying I'm going to be a priest. It's a calling.\n\"You reflect on these things when you've finished a film because you feel a bit emotional.\"\nAsked about Brexit, Greengrass - who voted Remain - says he has \"a dim sense that it's not going to be good\" for film-makers.\nThe industry, he says, was in \"a very good place\" within the EU.\n\"Will the damage be bad? I don't think anybody can say for sure. But any radical event like this can't be good for the development of a key strategic industry.  But we are going to have to hope because the issues go beyond our industry.\n\"I'm a born optimist. We are going to have to pick ourselves up and find a way out of this mess.\"\nWhatever happens, it's clear that Greengrass won't be taking to social media to give his opinion.  Has anyone ever suggested he should sign up?\n\"They wouldn't because it would be so ludicrous,\" he laughs.\n\"It would be like telling me to wear a suit.\"\nJason Bourne is in cinemas from 27 July.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] For David Cameron, in Paris for private talks and public declarations, this wordless gesture was perhaps the most important statement of all.\nTogether with his host, he laid a single white rose at the makeshift memorial outside the concert hall where 89 people, including one British man, were killed on 13 November.\nBut President Francois Hollande is looking for more than symbolic solidarity from his allies.  Over the past ten days, he's repeatedly said his country is \"at war\" with the so-called Islamic State, and has intensified air strikes over IS targets in Syria. Now he wants to know what his British ally will do to help.\nEurope's two military giants have both carried out strikes in Iraq, and British forces have helped with intelligence and refuelling over Syria.  But so far the UK Parliament has refused to sanction RAF air strikes in Syria.\nMr Hollande may well be hoping that the UN Security Council resolution last week, which called on member states to take \"all necessary measures\" to challenge IS in Iraq and Syria, will have changed Mr Cameron's assessment and lead him to ask parliament again.\nThe prime minister, who is due to present a comprehensive defence plan to parliament later this week, gave a strong personal endorsement to the French leader's stance.\n\"I firmly support the action that President Hollande has taken to strike (IS) in Syria and it is my firm conviction that Britain should do so too,\" he said.\nHe also offered France the use of Britain's Akrotiri military base in Cyprus to help with operations and refuelling.\nBut this is just the start of Mr Hollande's week of diplomacy.  After his meeting with David Cameron, he flies to Washington to discuss the situation with US President Barack Obama, before coming back to Paris for a meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday.\nThe emphasis in each meeting will be slightly different.  Aside from the need to assess the US-led military strategy in the Middle East, there are growing calls from European leaders to improve intelligence and data sharing.\nSecurity forces in both France and Belgium have been embarrassed by revelations that key suspects behind the Paris attacks moved around freely in the weeks leading up to the assaults, and in the days afterwards, even passing through checkpoints with apparent ease.\nAnd hanging over all the discussion of military and technical co-ordination is the elusive goal of a political solution in Syria which could help eradicate the militants' territory and source of revenue.  That is likely to be central to Thursday's talks in Moscow, between Mr Hollande and Vladimir Putin, his fourth foreign leader in as many days.\nAs experts point out, France - with its historically cordial ties to Russia, its membership of Nato, and its presence in the Middle East region - is in a unique position to help procure an agreement, and with it greater security at home.\nIn the meantime, Mr Hollande has a few other things on his mind, not least preparing for the UN Climate Conference which begins at the end of the month.  Oh, and the regional elections, in which Mr Hollande's Socialist party is tipped to come third, behind the main centre-right opposition and the far-right Front National.\nIf nothing else, Mr Hollande can perhaps take comfort from an eight percentage point spike in his previously dismal approval ratings, which now hover around the 30% mark.  Whether he manages to maintain that figure as time goes on and attention returns to the economy is another question.\nAs one newspaper article put it this weekend, three years into his term of office, President Hollande is seen as \"a bad captain in a fair wind, but a good leader for tough times.\"\n [OUT] ",

Overall, it is encouraging and engaging support for gay players and attempts to kick homophobia out of football.\"\nWhile several clubs BBC Sport has spoken to regarded the campaign as raising an important issue, the lack of notice given them and the campaign's links to a bookmaker known for publicity stunts have caused a few problems.\nIn 2012, Paddy Power had a TV advert suspended after it encouraged viewers to guess the gender of women at the Cheltenham horse racing festival.\nThe underlying message behind this campaign is a good one.

Indeed, we and our clubs have worked hard with government and other stakeholders to ensure the whole equalities agenda is something we are fully aware of and engaged in.\n\"However, we were not consulted about this particular campaign.

He returned the next day, and considered flying home, before the doctors gave Sears the green light to do the same.\nMurray had return flights on hold for several days. Having a bag packed and next to the front door is excellent practice for an expectant father, but it must be very unsettling when you are trying to negotiate the latter stages of a Grand Slam before attempting to dethrone the runaway world number one.\nWhen Murray lost his quarter-final to Roger Federer at the Australian Open of 2014, in his first major event since back surgery, he said it would have been \"completely stupid\" to expect him to win the title so soon. Victory this year was more plausible, but these were still a very challenging set of circumstances for a very emotional man.\nMurray played extremely well throughout his time down under, but he will have plenty of food for thought while on paternity leave. He is hoping to return for Great Britain's defence of the Davis Cup, which begins against Japan in Birmingham in the first week of March.\nThe first Masters events of the year follow in Indian Wells and Miami, before the European clay-court season heralds the start of the countdown to the French Open.\nMore pivotal clashes with Djokovic seem inevitable in the four months that will define the season, with Wimbledon, the Rio Olympics and the US Open all following on from Roland Garros.\nSo what will Murray's approach against the now 11-time Grand Slam champion be?\nHis start in Melbourne was well below par, and there was no indication of a clear strategy emerging until he found himself a set and a break down.

That target was later revised to one million.\nPeople in the BBC North East and BBC Cumbria regions are likely to have been the most active, according to the survey, with people in the BBC South West and BBC West Midlands regions the least.\nHowever, 88% of those polled said their activity levels had not changed following the Games, which ran from 27 July to 12 August.\nA recent  suggested that the number of people participating in sport once a week fell by 200,000 between October 2012 and April 2013.\nBut Sport England points out that, according to its figures, there are still 1.4m more people playing sport than in 2005, when London won the right to stage the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.\nLord Coe, who was chairman of the London Olympic Organising Committee and is now Olympics legacy ambassador, told BBC Breakfast: \"The overall response to your survey has been incredibly positive.\n\"It doesn't surprise me given the boost to the economy we revealed the other day.\n\"Again your survey shows a positive outcome of regional spread of interest. It was one of the ambitions we set out very clearly. We did not just want to talk about the three weeks in London.\"\nOn the issue of legacy, Sports Minister Hugh Robertson said: \"We've made an incredibly good start, but I would be the first to admit there is an awful lot left to do.\n\"I don't think we'll be able to make a judgment until three years after the Olympics, maybe five, and probably, if we are being really honest, until a decade has passed.\"\nHe added: \"The single most important legacy we have got from London 2012 is that, everywhere I go around the world, people still reminisce about the Games and say 'well done' for laying on the best Olympics and Paralympics of all time.\n\"That is a calling card that is worth a lot in the international market.\"\nAs Rebecca Adlington says, legacy is a difficult issue because people expect to see results instantly.\nOne year on from the Olympics, it is worth giving credit for the progress that has been made. Work on transforming the Olympic Park into a new community is under way and the venues all have their futures sorted.\nBut getting the country more active remains the biggest challenge. As the poll shows, changing sporting habits could take years. The worry is that the further one gets from the Games, the more momentum is lost.\nHas Britain got it right?\nDouble Olympic champion Rebecca Adlington, who quit competitive swimming after winning two bronze medals in London, added: \"Legacy is a difficult subject for people to talk about because people want to see it happening straight away.\n\"For me, what will be a nice moment is, in 10 or 15 years, seeing someone come out of a pool or the velodrome, doing their interviews and saying, 'I was inspired by London; it got me into sport'. That is what legacy is about.\"\nMo Farah, who won the 10,000m and 5,000m titles in 2012, said: \"We did the best job any country could ever do. After the Olympics so many kids have got involved into sport and been more active.\n\"We should be proud of what we did.\"\nA key part of the London 2012 legacy plan focused on sports facilities. Of those polled, 32% said they had noticed an improvement, although more than half said there had been no impact at all.\nOne in five people polled reported an additional benefit to their local economy and public services.\nHowever, 69% said there has been no impact on public services, while 67% said they have not witnessed any impact on the local economy.\nTim Lamb, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, the organisation responsible for the governing and representative bodies of sport and recreation in the UK, said: \"It's very important to keep the momentum going.\n\"We're going to have to find a way of investing in facilities in our sports clubs, making sure that when facilities are hired for sporting activity they are affordable, making sure that clubs and people playing sport have got the right equipment.\n\"It's about spending money more wisely and recognising the enormous social benefits that sport has.\n\"It is obviously good for your health, it can help to reduce anti-social behaviour, it's proven to improve academic attainment and it can help build community cohesion. It's a very low-cost way of tackling some of the key social problems that we've got in this country.\"\nBetween 5 and 21 July 2013, telephone interviews were conducted with 3,218 adults and the data weighted to be representative of all United Kingdom adults aged 18 and over.\nHave your say on the survey and Olympic legacy via Sportsday Live.\nThere is more discussion and debate about Olympic legacy where you live throughout the day on your BBC local radio station.\n [OUT] ",

The US has stationed hundreds of troops in Djibouti, its only African base, in an effort to counter terrorism in the region.\nDjibouti's location is the main economic asset of a country that is mostly barren. The capital, Djibouti city, handles Ethiopian imports and exports. Its transport facilities are used by several landlocked African countries to fly in their goods for re-export. This earns Djibouti much-needed transit taxes and harbour fees.\nAfter independence from France in 1977, Djibouti was left with a government which enjoyed a balance between the two main ethnic groups, the Issa of Somali origin and the Afar of Ethiopian origin.\nBut the country's first president, Hassan Gouled Aptidon, installed an authoritarian one-party state dominated by his own Issa community. Afar resentment erupted into a civil war in the early 1990s, and though Mr Gouled, under French pressure, introduced a limited multi-party system in 1992, the rebels from the Afar party, the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (Frud), were excluded.\nThus, Mr Gouled's Popular Rally for Progress party won every seat and the war went on. It ended in 1994 with a power-sharing deal which brought the main faction of Frud into government. A splinter, radical faction continued to fight until 2000, when it too signed a peace deal with the government of Gouled's successor, Ismael Omar Guelleh.\nMass protests took place after President Guelleh persuaded the National Assembly to amend the constitution to enable him to run for a third term, clearing the way for him to stand in the 2011 election, but these were soon put down.\n [OUT] ",

A French institute in Marseille has pledged to donate about 20 tonnes of books to the campaign.\n\"We hope the campaign will serve as a link between Mosul University and the rest of the world on academic, cultural, and social levels,\" the blogger says.\nThe aim is to collect at least 200,000 books.\nThe blogger told the BBC by email that some Iraqis responded to the drive by volunteering to collect books in major Iraqi cities, but the response from other Arab countries has been \"negligible with a capital N\".\n\"So far, we received only one single donation from an Iraqi lady living in Jordan, and frankly, her donation was the first donation we received since we launched the campaign.\"\nOne of the main obstacles to the campaign is logistics - specifically the shipment of books into Iraq and the war torn city itself.\nEarlier this month, Mosul Eye issued a plea via social media to Basra port authorities to facilitate the transfer of a 200-tonne shipment of books from a collection centre in Irbil.\nAnd new collection centres are now being established in the US and Europe.\nCampaigners will then work on collecting and categorising the books to prepare them for the shelves of Mosul's libraries once the city is fully recaptured from IS.\nThe army has already retaken the eastern side of the city, where the university is situated, and is regaining territory from the militants in the west.\nThe destruction of ancient sites has been characteristic of IS activity when it has taken control of areas of Syria and Iraq, a practice described by the UN cultural agency Unesco as \"cultural cleansing\".\nThe militants have destroyed shrines, statues and other sites of historical significance in line with a strict interpretation of Islam which forbids idolatry.\nThe ancient Syrian city of Palmyra bears the most visible scars of IS occupation.

But later in life he became a counterpoint to hardline conservatives.\n\"The different opinions and interpretations at time in this long period could never entirely break up the friendship between us,\" said Ayatollah Khamenei.\nMr Rafsanjani died on Sunday in a hospital in Tehran after suffering a heart attack.\nHis body was taken to Jamaran prayer hall, the residence of the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Rohullah Khomeini, where relatives, politicians and religious figures gathered to pay their last respects.\nMr Rafsanjani had been a mentor to President Rouhani, whom he supported after his own attempt to run in the 2013 election as a reformist candidate was rejected by the powerful Guardian Council.\nMr Rouhani said on Twitter: \"The soul of the great man of the revolution, symbol of patience and resistance, has gone to Heaven.\"\nAnalysts say Mr Rafsanjani's sudden death is a major blow to the president, who is preparing for re-election in May.\nIranian newspapers across the political spectrum are paying tribute to Mr Rafsanjani. Most front pages are splashed with pictures and captions highlighting his central role in Iranian politics. Many have used black as a background.\n\"Iran mourns the death of contemporary Amir Kabir,\" moderate Arman-e Emruz announces, comparing Rafsanjani to the man widely considered to be Iran's first reformer and moderniser.\nAn \"irretrievable loss\", moderate daily Iran laments, while reformist Aftab-e Yazd, under a picture of Mr Rafsanjani's grieving children, affirms that \"Iran is mourning\".\nEven hard-line dailies are joining in the accolades. Javan notes his closeness to the founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in its headline: \"Man of tough days of fighting and friend of Imam and the Leader rushes to meet God.\"\nHard-line Vatan-e Emrooz describes him as \"one of the pillars\" and \"a genuine figure\" of Iran's Islamic Revolution.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world. You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.\nBBC Persian's Kasra Naji says Mr Rafsanjani was a great survivor of the Iranian revolution, always managing to stay afloat in the unending political struggles between the hardliners and the moderates, remaining influential.\nIn recent years, our correspondent says, he has been a central figure in the reform movement that has been trying to have a moderating influence on Iran and Ayatollah Khamenei.\nMr Rafsanjani's final role was head of the Expediency Council, which tries to resolve disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council.\nAkbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was born in 1934 in south-eastern Iran to a family of farmers.\nHe studied theology in the holy city of Qom with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini - who went on to lead the Islamic revolution of 1979 - and was imprisoned several times under the Shah.\nIn the last year of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, Ayatollah Khomeini appointed him acting commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\nHe was seen as the main mover behind Iran's acceptance of the UN Security Council resolution that ended the war.\nMr Rafsanjani was also a key player in the development of Iran's nuclear programme, and recently gave staunch support to the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\nHe was a man known for a sharp wit but who could also be ruthless.\nHe advocated progressive economic policies, encouraging private businesses and improving infrastructure. His own business holdings were reported to be widespread.\nMr Rafsanjani ran for a third time for president in 2005 but lost to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nMr Rafsanjani became openly critical of the victorious president and in 2009, he sided with reformers who disputed that year's elections. Nevertheless, Mr Ahmadinejad won a second term.\nMr Rafsanjani continued to champion moderate causes, such as the release of political prisoners and greater political freedoms for parties prepared to work within the constitution.\nSome of the members of Mr Rafsanjani's family have also made the headlines. His daughter Faezeh Hashemi attracted the ire of hardliners when she met a leader of the Bahai religious minority - which Iran's leadership regards as a heretical sect - last year.\nAnd his son Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani was jailed in 2015 after being convicted of \"security offences and financial crimes\".\n [OUT] ",

We thought the nightmare of Australia was over but it is still here. I don't know where this side go.\n\"Cook is in terrible form. He will get tenser, it will get harder and I don't know how he is going to get out of it. It's a recipe for resignation. I don't know if he will but it is.\"\nIn both matches, England have been in winning positions but, bruised from their 5-0 Ashes humiliation, this developing side simply have not had the confidence to nail them down.\nIn the first Test at Lord's, a first-innings lead was undermined by a collapse on the fourth afternoon that ultimately left England short of time to bowl Sri Lanka out on the final day.\nAnd here at Headingley, they slumped from 278-2 to 365 all out in the first innings, let Sri Lanka post 457 in their second, then crumbled to 57-5 in their chase of 350.\nTo take the bowling first, I never thought I would find myself saying that Sri Lanka's pace bowlers had shown England's quicks how to bowl at Headingley, the home of English seam bowling.\nPut simply, England's pacers have been outperformed by a nation of spin bowlers. There was some talk about this Sri Lanka attack being no better than a county side. Maybe a county attack would have bowled better than England on that pitch today.\nThere was seam, swing and the odd hint of uneven bounce to be had on the fourth day. But, Liam Plunkett aside, a pace quartet that also contains James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Jordan has been way below par.\nPlunkett has run in hard and bowled with hostility, but Anderson has bowled too short, Broad has taken a hat-trick but nothing else and Jordan will end the Test wicketless.\nSome may criticise England's tactics today, and they certainly contributed to their problems. By dropping men back in the hope that Angelo Mathews would surrender the strike to Rangana Herath during the early part of the Sri Lanka pair's eight-wicket stand of 149, England had nowhere else to go when the plan did not work.\nCaptain Alastair Cook might also have opted to use the spin of Moeen Ali earlier, but he could have justifiably expected his pace bowlers to do the job and they failed him.\nNone of this should take anything away from the efforts of Mathews, who made a wonderful 160.\n1st Test v Sri Lanka, Lord's: Match drawn\n20 June: 2nd Test v Sri Lanka, Headingley\n9 July: 1st Test v India, Trent Bridge\n17 July: 2nd Test v India, Lord's\n27 July: 3rd Test v India, Southampton\n7 August: 4th Test v India, Old Trafford\n15 August: 5th Test v India, The Oval\nNot only did he negotiate the strike, but the Sri Lanka captain also hit boundaries with cavalier regularity. It was a serious innings delivered in a calm, patient, assured manner.\nIn Herath, he found a tail-end ally who made an immense contribution. Herath is clearly no mug, demonstrated by the fact he settled in for nearly three hours. It was quite brilliant.\nTheir efforts were in contrast to England's performance with the bat, which cracked under the pressure applied by Dhammika Prasad, bowling the sort of line and length of which England were incapable.\nCook's dismissal typifies where his game is at the moment. The image of him staring back at his broken stumps after bottom-edging a pull at such a wide ball encapsulated his predicament.\nGary Ballance was unfortunate - anyone can get a first baller - while Ian Bell got a beauty. In between, Sam Robson played a poor shot to edge to second slip.\nBut it was all summed up by Plunkett, the nightwatchman, scooping Herath's spin to cover when he should have been blocking out the final over.\nIt was a hideous end to a hideous day.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] And if you have ever experienced a scorchingly hot Brazilian day, you'll know that this is actually a wise thing. You really do want your lager to be super-chilled in such climatic conditions.\nWhile you can easily buy a cold beer from a supermarket or beach vendor, for many Brazilians their preferred port of call is still a boteco, the humble bar or pub.\nMost botecos are small, family-run businesses, which, for reasons lost in the mists of time, don't actually serve draft beer. Instead the beer - always lager - typically comes in large 600ml bottles.\nThe idea is that friends share a bottle - or many - between them, which they drink while eating plates of petiscos (snacks).\nThe petiscos are typically something deep fried, such as breaded cod balls, or a pastel, which is a type of small pasty that also gets the hot oil treatment.\nImagine an authentic Spanish tapas bar, only with no sherry, and more use of a fryer.\nWith hundreds of botecos in Rio de Janeiro alone, the more ambitious ones try to boost their business by standing out from the crowd.\nOne way many do this is by entering an annual Brazil-wide competition to find the best botecos in the country.\nNow in its 15th year, and free to enter, the Comida di Buteco contest judges bars according to four criteria - the quality of the food, the hygiene standards, the service, and crucially - the temperature of the beer.\nEach boteco is judged by both a panel of judges, who visit anonymously and provide 50% of its final score, and by popular vote.\nThis year 45 bars in Rio entered the competition, which ran for a month until the middle of May. Each puts forward one dish upon which their food should be marked.\nBotecos that take part generally enjoy a big boost in trade during the four weeks of the event, and then over the longer term if they win a prize.\nDavid Bispo, owner of boteco Bar do David, says that entering Comida di Buteco \"transformed\" his business.\nThe 43-year-old opened his bar five years ago when he found himself out of work.\nA fisherman by trade, and unable to find a job at the time, he decided that launching a bar serving food was his best option.\n\"Food is something people have to buy every day, so it generates income every day,\" he says. \"You probably haven't bought any clothes today, but you've probably bought food.\"\nSo in 2010 he launched Bar do David in the Chapeu Mangueira favela or shanty town, which clings to a steep hillside overlooking Rio's famous Copacabana beach.\nA year earlier the favela had been \"pacified\" by the police and soldiers, who had driven out the criminal gangs, so Mr Bispo was confident that it was now a good spot in which to open his bar.\nSo with his sisters helping out in the kitchen, his boteco opened its doors. Instead of just selling the typical pestiscos, Mr Bispo decided to also serve traditional Brazilian home-cooked dishes, such as feijoada, a thick bean and meat stew.\n\"These are the recipes that existed in my home,\" says Mr Bispo. \"[In essence] what we did was open our home to the public.\"\nIn the bar's first year of business, Mr Bispo decided to enter Comida di Buteco, putting forward a similar stew to be judged.\nThe restaurant won an award, and Mr Bispo says its business shot up, and stayed up.\nThe theme of this year's Comida di Buteco competition is \"fruit\", and Mr Bispo has entered with a dish of pork ribs served with a pineapple jam with mint and chilli, finished with crystallised pineapple.\nHe says that the dish has been so popular with his customers that he had to buy more than a tonne of raw ribs.\nAnd with the 2015 results just in, Mr Bispo's bar was judged to be the third best in Rio.\nThe competition was originally set up by a radio station in the city of Belo Horizonte, which is known as the \"pub capital of Brazil\".\nToday the contest is run by a small private company, which pays for the event by securing a number of sponsors, including potato crisp business Lay's, which is part of Pepsi, and food group Kraft.\nAnother Rio boteco that entered this year's competition is Angu do Gomes, located in the city's downtown area.\nThe bar, which traces its origin back in 1955, is still run by the same family, but it can certainly no longer describe itself as a small operation.\nInstead it can seat 250 people over three floors.\nOver the month of the competition the boteco's trade increased by 20%, according to co-owner Rigo Duarte, a grandson of the founder.\nThe 33-year-old says this was a welcome boost, as it can often be difficult for bars to make money in Rio, especially during the summer months - December to February - when people want to go to the beaches instead.\nMr Duarte, whose food entry in the competition was fish goujons with coconut and a berry sauce, adds that the event was a good way for him to meet other participants, and share ideas.\nHe adds: \"The thing about the competition isn't to win, but to participate.\"\nSadly Angu do Gomes didn't win an award this year, but Bode Cheiroso, a boteco close to Rio's giant Maracana football stadium, has just been voted the fourth best in Rio.\nCo-owner Emanuelle Braga Duarte Ribeiro, 38, says its business tripled during the month of the competition, as hungry diners flocked to try its entry dish of prawns covered with crushed cashew nuts, served with a passion fruit sauce.\n\"We typically make 2,000 reals ($636; ÃÂ£435) a day, but when the competition was on it was 6,000,\" she says.\n\"And we are hoping for return custom of 30%. If at least 30% of the people who came to the bar during the competition come back, we'll be super happy.\"\n [OUT] ",

So that gave me a bit of a boost coming here, which is also a place where I haven't played my best.\"\nMurray was the runner-up to Nadal at Indian Wells in 2009, but in the past six years has suffered early defeats at the hands of Donald Young, Guillermo Garcia-Lopez and - in last year's third round - Federico Delbonis.\nThe thin desert air makes the ball fly and jump off the court, and last year played havoc with the Scot's serve. He held back, for fear of missing, and was beaten in the second match he played.\nHis preparation had also been far from ideal. On the Sunday before an event due to be staged outdoors in 30C desert heat, Murray spent four hours and 54 minutes beating Kei Nishikori in the Davis Cup on an indoor court eight time zones away in Glasgow.\nHowever, this year's warm up in Dubai was much preferable and Murray was enthusiastic when talking about Great Britain's Davis Cup quarter-final in France.\nThat tie was secured in February when Britain beat Canada 3-2 without their leading player and will be held after the Miami Masters, which follows Indian Wells.\n\"It will have been a long stretch, but to get matches on clay is a positive thing - and my team are more pro it,\" Murray said.\n\"If I'd gone to Canada, it would have been bad news because physically I was not ready. I was struggling a little bit with the illness so it was a good thing I didn't go.\"\nHaving overcome shingles, Murray now has the awkward desert conditions to overcome, but has been given a favourable draw in Indian Wells.\nWhile his quarter is far from treacherous, the bottom quarter includes Novak Djokovic, Nadal, Federer, Juan Martin del Potro, Nick Kyrgios and Alex Zverev.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The case related to the 2003 killings of 200 residents of Bogoro village in the Ituri region of DR Congo.\nThe court in The Hague heard reports of victims being burned alive, babies battered and women raped.\nMr Ngudjolo denied ordering the attack, saying he learned of it days later.\nHe had been charged with seven counts of war crimes and three of crimes against humanity. Prosecutors said he had enlisted child soldiers to carry out the killings. Some of the killings were carried out with machetes.\nBut presiding Judge Bruno Cotte said the court acquitted Mr Ngudjolo of all charges, saying the prosecution had \"not proved beyond reasonable doubt that Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui was responsible\" for the crimes committed.\nHe said the decision was unanimous, and that witness testimony had been \"too contradictory and too hazy\".\nBy Jonathan KachelewaBBC News, Eastern DR Congo\nFighting is still going on in the mineral-rich Ituri region. All the different armed groups in the area have formed a coalition. They include Mr Ngudjolo's FNI, which is drawn from the Lendu ethnic group, and its former enemies from the Hema ethnic group.\nSome former fighters joined the army during a series of peace deals, but all the others in this region have now joined together. As ever, they are fighting for control of the region's gold mines, as well as for their own protection.\nA UN report says the rebels are backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which denies it.\nThe violence in Ituri was a part of the DR Congo war. It remains overshadowed by fighting elsewhere in eastern DR Congo. Some 50,000 people were killed in the province in four years before the European Union sent a peacekeeping force in 2003 - its first mission outside Europe.\nMr Ngudjolo showed no emotion at the acquittal, according to the Associated Press news agency. His lawyer, Jean-Pierre Kilenda, said his client had always insisted he was innocent.\nIn its summary, the court stressed that the ruling did not mean it believed no crimes were committed in Bogoro \"nor does it question what the people of this community have suffered on that day\".\n\"The chamber also emphasised that the fact of deciding that an accused is not guilty does not necessarily mean that the chamber finds him innocent,\" the ICC said in a statement.\n\"Such a decision simply demonstrates that, given the standard of proof, the evidence presented to support his guilt has not allowed the chamber to form a conviction 'beyond reasonable doubt'.\"\nJudge Cotte ordered Mr Ngudjolo's immediate release, and rejected prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's attempts to have him detained pending an appeal.\n\"The chamber dismisses the prosecution's application for further detention,\" Judge Cotte said, adding that there were \"no exceptional circumstances\" to detain Mr Ngudjolo further.\nHuman Rights Watch said the verdict \"leaves the victims of Bogoro and other massacres by his forces without justice for their suffering\".\n\"The ICC prosecutor needs to strengthen its investigations of those responsible for grave crimes in Ituri, including high-ranking officials in Congo, Rwanda and Uganda who supported the armed groups fighting there,\" said Geraldine Mattioli-Zeltner, the group's international justice advocacy director.\nThe Coalition for the ICC, a campaign group that monitors the court's work, said the verdict was \"a hard blow for the victims and affected communities who had placed all their hopes in the Court to deliver justice, considering the great harm they suffered during the ethnic war in Ituri\".\nThe verdict is only the second in the 10-year history of the ICC, and the first acquittal.\nIn March, Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga, Mr Ngudjolo's enemy in Ituri, was found guilty of recruiting and using child soldiers between 2002 and 2003. He was sentenced to 14 years in jail.\nThe conflict in Ituri was a distinct part of the war that raged in DR Congo following the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda and involved troops and fighters from several neighbouring countries.\nMilitia leaders from all sides have been accused of using the conflict to profit from the region's mineral reserves, especially gold.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The products for conditions like eczema and psoriasis can leave people at risk of setting themselves ablaze.\nIf people use the creams regularly but do not often change clothes or bedding, paraffin residue can soak into the fabric, making it flammable.\nThe medicines regulator has updated its guidance and says all creams containing paraffin should carry a warning.\nDespite warnings going back more than 10 years, BBC Radio 5 live Investigates has discovered there have been 37 deaths in England since 2010 linked to the creams.\nCarol Hoe's husband Philip died after accidentally setting himself on fire at Doncaster Royal Infirmary in 2006 when sparks from a cigarette reacted with the emollient cream he was covered in.\n\"I got a phone call from the ward sister to say can you get to the hospital as soon as possible, Philip's had an accident,\" she said.\n\"Philip had caught fire. He had sneaked off onto a landing for a sneaky cigarette, a gust of wind must have caught the lighter, and it set fire to him.\"\nWithin seconds Mr Hoe, who was receiving treatment for psoriasis, was engulfed in flames and he died shortly after being transferred to another hospital in Sheffield.\n\"When we got there, the staff came to me and told us he was covered with 90% burns,\" said Mrs Hoe.\n\"There was nothing they could do.\"\nThe coroner at his inquest drew attention to the dangers posed by skin creams, and the now defunct National Patient Safety Agency advised that paraffin-based products are easily ignited with a naked flame.\nThe Medicines and Health Care Products Regulatory Agency later issued two more warnings, but deaths continued to occur.\nThe coroner at the inquest into the death of 63-year-old Christopher Holyoake in Leicester in 2015 heard his bedding was covered in residue from an over-the counter dermatological cream called E45.\nWhen the flame from his cigarette lighter came into contact with the bedding, the residue acted as an accelerant, giving Mr Holyoake little chance of surviving the fire.\nAfter the inquest the coroner wrote to the manufacturer of E45 - outlining her concerns there were no warnings on the packaging about the product being highly flammable.\nE45 has since agreed to include a flammability warning on some products and these will find their way onto shop shelves from next month.\nAlso in 2015, an inquest into the death of 84-year-old John Hills heard he died in a nursing home in Worthing in Sussex after setting himself on fire with his pipe.\nA paraffin-based cream called Cetraben had soaked into his clothes and was found to have played a part in his death.\nThe coroner said he was concerned the dangers associated with the cream were not widely known. The manufacturers say they intend to carry out a review of the safety information included on their product packaging.\n5 live Investigates approached all 53 fire brigades in the UK to find out how many deaths had been linked to the use of paraffin-based skin creams since 2010.\nJust six from England provided information - revealing the 37 fatal incidents.  The majority came from the London Fire Brigade which reported 28 fatalities.\nThe problem has become sadly familiar to Darren Munro, borough commander for London's Wandsworth Fire Station, who has been campaigning to raise awareness.\n\"In four out of the last six fatalities that I've personally attended, I would say the emollient cream has had a direct result in the flame spread and the speed at which the fire took hold,\" he said.\n\"The creams themselves aren't dangerous, it only becomes dangerous when you mix it in with other factors.\"\nLondon Fire Brigade says even regular washing of night clothes and bed linen might not eliminate the danger, as paraffin is invisible and can accumulate over time.\nMr Munro suspects the authorities are unaware of the true scale of fires related to skin creams.\n\"One of the fatalities that we dealt with, unfortunately, the individual had had a previous fire, which wasn't reported,\" he said.\n\"The carers or a neighbour had put the fire out, so therefore the London Fire Brigade weren't called.\n\"I would imagine that there have been numerous other instances where people have been injured, but because the flames have been extinguished, people haven't called the fire brigade\".\nUntil recently, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency only asked that a flammability warning be put on packaging if a cream contained more than 50% paraffin.\nThe agency is now urging manufacturers to add a warning to the packaging of skin creams containing any paraffin.\nAnd since being alerted to 5 live's findings, the organisation representing manufacturers of branded over-the-counter medicines has said it will explore whether all paraffin-based creams should carry a warning as standard.\nJohn Smith, chief executive of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain said some manufacturers had already taken that step.\nHe added the association wanted \"to reassure people that the normal use of emollients in the home is considered appropriately safe provided the products are used in accordance with the on-pack instructions and accompanying patient information leaflet.\n\"Manufacturers of emollients are not at present required by regulation or statute to include fire safety warnings on packaging.  Safety is nonetheless of paramount importance.\"\nMore than a decade after her husband died, this all seems too little, too late for Carol Hoe.\n\"To be quite honest I'm really angry because at the inquest, the coroner said that further steps should be taken to give people warnings about this and for nearly 40 more deaths to happen after Philip, I just can't understand it,\" she said.\n5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 19 March at 11:00 GMT - catch up on BBC iPlayer Radio.\nHave you got something you want investigating?

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] But there is, nonetheless, an ever-growing list of promising companies that sell out or simply fail, rather than growing into British titans that could rival the likes of Microsoft, Apple, Google, IBM, Intel, Oracle and Facebook.\nBelow are some notable examples:\nThere was a time in the 1980s when video gamers and teenage coders across the UK were more likely to be hunched over one of Sir Clive Sinclair's computers than an American or Asian-made alternative.\nSinclair Research may have only made its ZX Spectrums for domestic sale, but it licensed Timex to make clones that were sold elsewhere in Europe, the US and South America. Dozens of unofficial versions were a hit in the Soviet Union too, proving their appeal, if not a source of income.\nBut the firm got unstuck when it tried to enter the business market. Its Sinclair QL was designed to outperform IBM's PCs, but its tape-based Microdrive storage was unreliable and the British company did not offer the kind of telephone support the corporate sector required.\n\"Their computer designs were abominable by our standards,\" Sir Clive later told the BBC.\n\"But because... IBM had such a powerful position, I don't think we could have challenged it.\"\nAfter the C5 electric vehicle also failed to catch on, a cash-strapped Sir Clive sold his firm's brand and assets in 1986 to Amstrad, another domestic computer-maker.\nAmstrad later faced troubles with computer storage of its own and eventually switched focus to TV set-top boxes before selling out to BSkyB.\nYears before Facebook was founded, let alone open to the public, a couple from Hertfordshire and one of their friends, created a social network that attracted millions of users in the UK, Australia, South Africa and beyond.\nFriends Reunited connected members with their former classmates by getting them to share the names of their old schools and the year they had left.\nOver time, the theme was expanded to cover places of work, sports teams and neighbourhoods where users had lived. Spin-off sites were also created to offer online dating, job searches, message boards and ways for users to trace their family trees.\nWhen ITV paid Â£175m to buy the operation in 2005, it expected to continue its red hot growth.\nBut the broadcaster made the mistake of continuing to charge users to contact each other, rather than relying on ad revenue alone, for too long.\nThat allowed Facebook, MySpace and Bebo to take the lead.\nITV sold the business for just Â£25m in 2009. Although it limped on under other UK owners until earlier this year, it never regained its momentum.\nLast.fm began its life as an internet radio station and an associated website where users listed the tracks they liked to meet others with similar tastes.\nBut it only really took off after it merged with Audioscrobbler, a plug-in that automatically logged songs that its users had listened to on their computer and MP3 player.\nThis made it possible to build up a deeper picture of its users' habits, which in turn helped the service make song recommendations, and then later suggest nearby concerts and music videos too.\nBy 2007, the service had attracted 15 million users. However, rather than stay independent, its founders opted to sell out to the US media group CBS for $280m (Â£212m).\nThey acknowledged that they had struggled to find a way to be profitable in light of the royalty and copyright fees the music industry was demanding, and said that teaming up with the US broadcaster gave them greater negotiating clout.\nHowever, the service continued to rack up losses.\nA subscription-based music streaming app was a flop, and these days Last.fm is a relatively minor player. It still recommends music but relies on YouTube, Spotify and other third-party services to provide it.\nSilicon Valley might have Google, but for a time Autonomy was the UK's most highly regarded search giant.\nThe firm was founded in Cambridge in 1996 and developed software that allowed its clients to hunt through \"unstructured data\" - emails, videos, social network posts, phone calls, images and other information recorded in apps - that was not kept in neat databases.\nThe service proved popular with a wide range of organisations, which used it to carry out legal checks, create archives and focus their marketing.\nIn 2011, Autonomy proved its data-analysis techniques had further potential when it developed an augmented reality tool that allowed smartphones to superimpose graphics over real-world views.\nHollywood director JJ Abrams was among the first to use it within an app that promoted his film Super 8, and others followed.\nThe same year, Autonomy's chief executive, Mike Lynch, agreed to sell the business to HP for just over Â£7bn. And that's where things got complicated.\nThirteen months after the takeover was completed, HP claimed Mr Lynch had misrepresented his company's financial position and wrote down most of its value.\nThe two sides are now suing each other in a case that is likely to drag on for years.\nIn a final twist, HP has agreed to sell Autonomy and some of its other operations to Micro Focus, an English software developer, meaning what is left of the business will soon be controlled again from UK shores.\nUntil very recently, ARM Holdings was the flag-waver for the UK's tech scene.\nThe computer chip designer was created in Cambridge in 1990 as a joint venture between Acorn Computers and Apple.\nThe US firm wanted a processor to power its first hand-held device, the Newton MessagePad, but later sold its stake after Steve Jobs returned and ditched the product.\nThat didn't end the relationship between the two companies though, as ARM's designs were used in processors that powered first the iPod, then the iPhone and iPad.\nMost other smartphones are also dependent on ARM's chip creations, in addition to a wide assortment of other technology including smart TVs, cars, fitness trackers, smartwatches and drones.\nMany people thought ARM might remain independent as it suited device-makers not to have the firm owned by one of their competitors.\nBut in July, Japan's Softbank agreed to pay Â£24bn for it.\nARM's management suggested the move would help it \"move faster in creating new technologies\".\nBut its co-founder Hermann Hauser has been critical, saying that ARM could have grown \"even faster\" if it had stayed solo.\nThe UK is famed for its expertise in artificial intelligence.\nBut several of the sector's start-ups - including DeepMind, Magic Pony and VocalIQ - only became known to the wider public once they had fallen into Silicon Valley hands.\nSwiftkey was different because it actually brought popular products to market before being taken over.\nThe London-based firm made a keyboard app for Android and iOS handsets.\nThe software predicts what its users want to write - including emojis - after they have only entered a few keystrokes.\nOver time, its suggestions get more accurate as it studies their habits, and if allowed to review their social network posts, it gets better still.\nSwiftkey scored a publicity coup when its tech was adapted to help Prof Stephen Hawking type twice as fast as he could before.\nAnd in 2014, it decided to accelerate its growth further by making its app free to use, only charging consumers if they wanted to change the keyboard's design and colour.\nThe tactic worked. By the end of 2015, Swiftkey had been installed on about 300 million devices.\nBut it also caused its losses to grow.\nIn February this year, the business was sold for a reported Â£250m to a deep-pocketed buyer.\n\"We believe joining Microsoft is the right next stage in our journey,\" its co-founders blogged.\nMaybe.\nBut it also highlights how UK start-ups often feel pressured to sell once their early-stage funding starts to run out.\n [OUT] ",

Nigel Benn has been as fit for 21 years since he left the ring as Steve Collins has since he left the ring, and they left the ring just 11 months apart.\n\"They have been close to having fights.

If we lost the cup and couldn't find another Ben would die. He would be put on fluids in hospital but he would yank out the tubes.\n\"This tiny blue cup dictates our life.\"\nKatie Roden tweeted a photo of the cup she owns, adding: \"I have one - here it is! DM me your address and I will send it tomorrow.\"\nRoslyn Barnett wrote: \"I have that exact one my daughter had from being a baby!! Still have it and i can send it to you x\".\nOthers responded with the suggestion that the cup could be made using a 3D printer if he was able to provide one to be copied.\nMarc, who lives near Great Torrington, north Devon, said he had been overwhelmed with the response which saw one of his appeals retweeted 12,000 times.\nHe said one 16-year-old had used the particular cup as a child and had never wanted to throw it away - but offered to donate it to Ben after seeing the appeal.\nThe dad-of-three, whose two other children also have special needs, told the BBC: \"I cried. It's been incredible. I didn't expect it.\n\"I've had people tweeting to say good luck and people looking in their cupboards for the cups. They don't know me - it's been amazing and moving.\n\"I feel humble. It's a lovely thing.

It would be life-changing.\"\nFull-time carer Marc said he now had around seven replacements being sent to him and hoped to stock up on even more.\nTommee Tippee said it was touched by Ben's story and staff were doing everything they could to find a cup for Ben.\nSarah Scott, global head of consumer experience, added: \"The cup he previously had was a Tommee Tippee cup that we made for Boots in the late 1990s and our team is currently looking through all our archive product samples to see if we have one that's just right for Ben.\"\nAnyone who can offer Marc an exact copy can contact him on Twitter at @PMPProject.\n [OUT] ",

Some say it undermines the ability of the forces to do their job and keep us safe.\nBut supporters of the Human Rights Act say it's essential for our human rights to be protected by the European court.\nTim Hancock, from Amnesty UK, says under the Tories' plan, \"human rights would be reserved for only those people the government decides should get them.\"\nHere are some ways people from around the UK say the Human Rights Act has helped them.\nSteven Neary has autism. He was 21 when his father, Mark, put him in temporary care for a few days.\nBut the authorities were concerned over Steven's behaviour there and moved him to a special unit, where he was kept against his family's wishes, for a year.\nMark took the case to court and a judge decided the west London council had violated Steven's human rights to liberty, and respect for private and family life.\nMark told Newsbeat \"Steven wouldn't have come home if it hadn't been for the Human Rights Act\".\nIn 2013 a teenager known in court as ZH was awarded damages of ÃÂ£28,250 after it was found that police breached his right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, and his right to liberty.\nWhen he was 16, he was taken on a school trip to a swimming pool in West London.\nAs he stood by the side of the pool, he became fascinated by the water and wouldn't move.\nThe pool staff were concerned, and called the police. But when they arrived, he jumped into the pool. Several police officers got into the pool, lifted him out, pinned him down, put him in handcuffs and leg restraints, and placed him in the back of the police van, alone.\nJenny and Tim Paton and their three children lived in the same house in Poole for more than 10 years.\nBut, their local council received an anonymous tip-off that they were lying about living in a particular school catchment area.\nThe local authority set up covert surveillance and for three weeks officials sat outside their home, making notes and taking photographs.\nThe family felt violated and took the case to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal and the council was found to have breached their human rights.\n [OUT] ",

I feel it's such a shame as it is an incredibly rewarding job on a good day.\n\"However, even over the last year the pressures are getting greater and greater and I feel we can provide a less good service.\n\"It has even got to the point that I have private health insurance for myself and my family as I worry that the NHS can not provide a timely service anymore with the pressures.\n\"I've also started looking to work in other environments - with the military or privately - where you get longer appointments with patients and the pressure is less...\n\"I also feel ashamed to say that a relative is thinking of training as a doctor, and I have been very reluctant to encourage this.\"\nDr Kapla de Silva, 35, a final year cardiology registrar from London, says the \"unstinting\" belief in the NHS he had when he left medical school \"has been whittled away\".\nA slew of government interventions have seen the training system \"eroded\", and most proposals under Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt - leading to recent strikes by junior doctors in England - have \"degraded morale even further,\" he said.\n\"The way the whole saga has been portrayed by the government and, more worryingly by the media, has been extremely disheartening,\" he said.\n\"I work days, and nights, seven days a week, on a rota, as do all of my colleagues, and many hospital specialties do the same...\n\"Whilst I do not ask for a pay rise, I am frustrated that I will be financially less secure despite the number of years I have worked and trained for.\"\nHe added: \"As cliched as it sounds, I work for my patients... no matter what happens I will do my utmost to deliver the best care that is possible. \"\n\"I do however, think that overtime, a workforce that is disenchanted and disillusioned will inevitably be less inclined to work the extra hours, and go the extra mileÃ¢â¬Â¦which would be a sad thing to see.\"\nDr Andrew Bull, from Bristol who qualified nine years ago, says he has had to take breaks from work due to low morale.\nA GP for just two years, he says: \"Gradually I am enjoying my career less and less. I originally thought I would be a doctor for 40 years but now I struggle to imagine being a doctor beyond five more years.\n\"The low morale has complex causes but most doctors chose this job for the satisfaction it gives rather than for the money. Take away the satisfaction and we are not left with much from our career.\n\"I've had a couple of breaks from work to help get my enthusiasm back. It worked - it's useful to have a break, some people have enough and retire early.\n\"I've worked in Australia - it's another health system, you realise the NHS isn't as bad as everyone makes out. Outside the UK, many countries are jealous of the NHS. There are so many things it can do that the rest of the world can't.\n\"I'm thinking of working abroad again, maybe next year as things can get a bit stale. It'll be short term to begin with - maybe a year, like I did in Australia. I'm not planning on leaving forever. My plan would be to come back.\"\nDr Stefan Cembrowicz, 69, former Senior Partner at Montpelier Health Centre in Bristol, said that the current generation of doctors face fresh challenges.\nIn the mid-1990s, he interviewed 20 of his registrars at Montpelier about a number of staff conditions, including morale.\nHe said: \"They all had surprisingly high morale - they nearly all said their morale was eight out of 10. Why? Well they were a capable, high calibre bunch, but it was because they were looking forward to a good career.\"\nTwenty years later, there is \"a state of unease within the medical profession\", the GMC has warned.\nDr Cembrowicz said: \"As I understand it, the junior doctors' problem isn't money, it's the rota. What you have is a very hard pressed workforce already filling in the cracks, and being asked to fill in even more gaps on the rota is the last straw.\nHe added: \"We must cherish them because they are the brightest and motivated people in the country.\"\nDr Cembrowicz pointed out that his generations of doctors were almost entirely male and did not have the shared childcare duties that they face today.\n\"If you change have to ask people to change their child care for rotas all the time, the sky will fall - it costs money and what's worse is all the organising\".\nDr Matt Piccaver, 38, a GP from Suffolk, maintains doctor will take the pressure first, before it hits the patients.\n\"Doctors just put more hours in - there aren't really corners you can cut. You can tell them to keep their coat and shoes on to save time, that's about it. To do the job properly you have to do all the right checks and you can't cut corners with those.\n\"You keep on absorbing until you personally suffer. I've been a GP for 11 years and it's an exhausting privilege - I'm knackered but I love the job\".\nWith morale remaining low in the aftermath of the junior doctors' strikes, he said: \"I think patients are still on our side, but in the media it's like we are the bad guys. We seem to be vilified in the press - it's reduced the perception of it being an attractive career.\n\"No one wants to be a GP anymore, no one wants to work - unbelievably - in paediatrics, or A&E.\nHe said the NHS was being \"set up to fail\" by the government, which is not giving it enough money in the face of rising patient numbers.\n\"The government needs to shape society around a world where one in three of us is elderly. They need to invest in social and community care - and give us adequate funding for the job, we need to attract people to it and get away from this toxic, awful feeling\".\n [OUT] ",

And he said no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings.\nThe Popplewell inquiry, held three weeks after the disaster, ruled the fire was started by a spectator dropping a cigarette which ignited into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand.\nMr Fletcher, whose book is being serialised by the Guardian, said the inquiry did not look at the finances of Mr Heginbotham, who died in 1995.\nThe book does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says the chairman's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling about ÃÂ£27m in today's terms, warranted further investigation.\nSir Oliver said although he could understand previous fires raising suspicions, the inquiry was conducted \"perfectly properly\".\nHowever, he said the police should investigate the cause of the other fires allegedly connected to Mr Heginbotham.\nSir Oliver said: \"I don't think it's going to affect what we decided but I think it is important from a public point of view that the police look at the other fires and see if there was anything sinister.\"\nDet Supt Mark Ridley, of West Yorkshire Police's Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: \"Should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty's Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.\"\n [OUT] ",
