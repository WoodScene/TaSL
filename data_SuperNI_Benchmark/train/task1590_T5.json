I have the same opinion when it comes down to our relationship. I prefer to play France decisevely in the West when an opportunity presents itself.

I've heard from everyone in the east, but not much substance, which probably means a bunch of passive openings.  If there's little fighting between the Eastern powers it might make it tougher for us, so hopefully things will shake up a bit in that department. If you are also finding that there isn't a whole lot of commitment going on there, and you have some interest in an unorthodox play, then maybe there is some potential for us to work together directly.\", 'Yeah, everyone is cagey and conservative, at least in words.
