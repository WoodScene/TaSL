The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: it happened last year. i was 29. never, until that day, had i broken a bone in my body. i was pretty proud of that; but pride comes before destruction.\n\nmy wifey had arranged a surprise trip up to visit a college friend and his family. we'd studied together during my exchange year in the us, and we became great friends. we've since had kids, got jobs; you know - done life.\n\nthings didn't start off great as, on the morning we left, my oldest (2 at the time) wasn't feeling great. we thought nothing of it. nothing of the fact that we had been hanging around with one of his mates who was pretty sick the day before. that turned into what we now affectionately refer to as the plague. the plague that got my other kiddo, their three kids, and one of them, violently sick. but that's another story for another time.\n\nmy friend and i wanted to go to the local park and visit his nearest pok√®stop. who wouldn't?\n\nwe had a fixed gear bike and a skateboard between us - he'd left his longboard at work, and while i was really looking forward to using it, i figured we'd switch out and take turns on these other modes of transportation.\n\nit's here that i'll say that a skateboard, to me, was only ever a means of transportation. my best mate and his brother loved going down to the park or cruising through town looking for ledges and steps. not me. i always wanted a longboard, but a skateboard did the job. a to b. home to college, college to town, etc. as long as it was flat, i was happy.\ni'll also mention that using someone else's skateboard is rather like borrowing their car. sure, you know the fundamentals - how to direct it, slow it, generally maneuver it - but it will always feel... off... not quite your own. not quite comfortable. their trucks will be tighter, their bearings faster; the deck will be curved a little more, and the wheels a bit harder. so many things to fight against.\n\nwe set off one the first day with no problem. i rode the bike, he held the seat. three blocks there, three back. easy!\n\nthe second day, i rode there again. we decided that i'd ride the skateboard back and he'd cycle. bad decision number 1.\n\na block and a half down, we were making some pretty good speed. i was loving the feeling of pavement under my wheels again! but as we hit a new stretch of asphalt, i bumped and tensed up a little. major speed wobble. my stomach knotted.\ni let go of the bike and ran the board down. no incident. ... so i got back on. bad decision number 2.\n\nwe set off again and built up some more speed. his house was just on the other side of the apex of a small hill, so as we approached, i saw that there was a little downhill stint before his driveway. we had some fair speed, so i didn't want to hit that hill - i mean, speed wobble going down that would be terrible!\nagain, the bike was a fixed gear, so all i needed to do was hold on until he had slowed down in his driveway, then i could dismount and we could carry on with the day. rent a movie, get some barbecue.\n\nbut no. i made bad decision number 3. i let go of the bike in order to avoid the hill.\nwith good speed, i carved to the side of the road to stop. i ride regular, so with my left foot planted firmly over the front trucks, i slid my right foot off the back and brought it forward to drag on the road and slow me down.\ncue the most intense speed wobble of my life as i tense up on one foot, board going mental, headed towards a curb.\n\nas i fall, i do what i did through high school rugby - tuck up, lead with the shoulder.\n\nmy knee hits first. tears a perfect square out of my favourite jeans. then my side, as i acquire an odd, uniformly rectangle-shaped road rash. my upper arm and shoulder hit with a crunch, the top of my head thuds down just shy of the curb.\n\ni know something's up but there is no pain. none.\n\ni rise to my feet and i mentally assess what's just gone on.\n\nthen i move my left arm forward at the shoulder. it \"shlucks\" forward way too easy. and pops back unnaturally. i do it two or three times.\n\n\"mate,\" i said, \"i think this is dislocated.\"\n\ni reach up with my right hand to feel a massive bump where my usually bumpless clavicle sits.\n\n\"oh, definitely broken,\" i almost chuckle.\n\nwhat followed was a cocktail of ambulance rides, staying very still, sleeping very little, and working... not so much. i saw a doctor eight days after doing this and he said that if i didn't have the frame i did, it wouldn't have surprised him if the bone had split clean through my shoulder.\nhe scheduled me for surgery the next day. miraculously, it hadn't broken through the membrane around the bone itself, so all three pieces of my completely demolished collar bone were as cooperative as they could be for the strip of metal that my body now hosts.\n\nmy first broken bone. go big or go home, right?\n\ni missed some work before the surgery, and a good few days afterwards. ate through my sick leave, personal days, and then some. cut two of my paycheques in half (and as the sole income for my family of four, that stung a little). missed enough work to disqualify me from my bonus. all the while i needed help getting dressed, needed to be driven everywhere, and couldn't hug my wifey or my boys.\n\ni shouldn't have let go of that bike.\n [OUT] ",

(i think the funeral home demands this to make sure that the family later can't accuse the funeral home employees of robbing the deceased's plot).\n\nso, in this case that lucky family member was me. my grandmother had no close remaining relatives, my mother had died in march and had been my grandma's only remaining child, my dad was no help, so the care of the plots now fell to me. \n\nthe plot my grandma was going into was that of her foster-father. this man died about 20 years before i was born, so it suffices to say that i didn't know the man. heck, i had never even seen a picture of him. still, i was the one that had to \"supervise\" his transfer to a smaller coffin.\n\nso, there i was the day of the transfer and i was close to losing my shit. 2014 had not been good to me; my mom died in march, then my grandma died in december right before christmas and now here i was about to see my first skeleton. sure i'd seen dead bodies before, but never in that state of decomposition. i was pretty sure i was going to faint that day. my dad had come with me, but being the big hero he is, he was walking around somewhere between the plots and was no support to me. \n\nthe cemetery caretakers show up and start opening the plot, all while i'm wondering when my nerves are going to get the best of me and i end up going night night. i look around where i'm standing to make sure that if i do faint, that there's some soft grass to land in. to my surprise i make it to the point where the coffin is taken out of the plot and the caretakers are waiting for my permission to open the casket.\n\ni give the go ahead and there he is; my great-grandfather. it was like a skeleton wearing a pale blond wig and an old dusty blue suit. i could even see his dentures still sitting in what was left of his jaw. \n\nat this point curiosity is getting the best of me and i'm slowly inching my way closer and closer to the coffin trying to get a better look. i get up all to way to the coffin and take a closer look at what once was a living, breathing person. it was an odd experience to see what we end up as. \n\nas i'm dealing with all that i'm seeing, i take a deep breath and mutter to myself \"ok.\". \napparently, i said \"ok\" a bit louder than i thought, cause the caretaker looks at me and says \"ok?\". i say \"yes, ok.\". to which then the caretaker again says \"ok\" and proceeds to yank off the skeleton's skulls and plops it into a small box on the ground. \nhe then grabs the hand and begins cracking the fingers off piece by piece and also drops those in the small box.\n\nfrom the background i hear my dad say \"okay, we're gonna go now!\"\n\n \n\n\nedit: typo\n\nupdate: this is what the graves look like \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/hklus\n [OUT] ",

(mike's and vodka) i know. i'm a white girl stuck in a guys' body. so anyway i wanted to try something new, i really wanted to get some mixed drinks like.. the stuff to make margaritas or something! my roommate would not stop hounding me about it how \"gay\" it was to get what i wanted. (btw we live in ky. it's bad enough that i play tennis and wear slim fit clothing, so if i drink anything \"girly\" i get branded as a homosexual because.. you know, rednecks and stuff.)\n\nso i end up just getting a 6-pack of dos equis and red bridge. so i get home and it's probably about 1pm at this point, my other two roommates wake up and i reminded them it was national free comic book day. so we went to get some comics. got back at about 3:30pm.\n\nroommate 1: the one that came with me to the liquor store is asleep\n\nroommate 2: also asleep. \n\nroommate 3: pitty played some mk10 with me for about 30 mins just because he didn't want me to be alone on my birthday. \n\n\ntime is now 4pm. i honestly planned on just chilling alone having my first legal drinks, but a bunch of guys at work had the idea of having a huge party at my place at about 10pm. well not of them where replying on fb and things were looking vague so i started drinking. \n\nat about 5:30pm i dragged a camping chair out in the parking lot, propped my feet up on my impala, and kept on drinking and reading comics in the sun. randomly out of nowhere a guy i used to work with on my 3rd shift job rolled up. i didn't even know he knew where i lived.\n\nthis guy is a creep, literally the definition of creep. he's like 28 and lives alone with his mom, no girlfriend because he creeps the hell out of them all. but he's an alright guy. he gets out of his car and i stand and wobble over to him beer in hand and ask \"how's it going?\" fast forward a few minutes we go inside and just start chatting. the chat lasts about an hour and a half and he get's up and goes \"well, i guess i'm headed home. i didn't even know it was your birthday i was just trying to find out if i knew anybody buying the maypac fight for tonight\" and he leaves.\n\ni keep drinking and i never drank the same beer twice. i grabbed a different one each time and lined them up on how much i liked them. \n\nat this point i realize no one from work is going to show up, my roommates have to leave for work at 9:50 pm, and my new girlfriend had a lot of school work/finals to study for. but i had a salvation...\n\nthere was a pretty cool guy i knew that i got a job at my current place of employment that was probably still coming. i met him through his wife, who i used to get absolutely shit faced with all of the time. they were both supposed to come over, so hey. it'd be an alright birthday celebration after all. \n\nwell it's about 9:30pm and i'm still just drinking and drinking. i had my astro a40's on listening to hollywood undead's new album just kind of rolling around feeling good. i randomly looked over at our front door and notice the top of what looked like a girl's head. considering she looked to be about 4 foot nothing it had to be the  girl that was coming with her husband. i open the door and she darts in holding a bunch of pizza boxes. \"sorry (husbands name) can't come over tonight he's passing a kidney stone.\"\n\nso she sits on the couch and starts drinking with me. my roommates leave for work and it's just us. i'm extremely bored as i'm about to tell her i'm getting way to sleepy to stay up and she suggests getting the weed out of her car. she knew i'd never smoked it before but was curious. so you know, being intoxicated impairs your decision making. so i say \"fuck it\".\n\nwe go in the half/bath and she prepares a \"bowl\" whateverthefuckthatis.jpg she smokes a small about and hands it to me and i light the thing and smoke it until there's nothing but black ashes in it. nothing.\n\nshe's like \"ooooh gosh i'm already so fucked up omg im so high lulz\"\n\nso i smoked literally 4 more bowls withen about 4 minutes. still nothing. i was probably way to drunk to feel it. well i go to take one last hit before giving up and i inhaled way too fucking hard and it scorched the inside of my throat. i started violently coughing and dropped her glass pipe and it busts fucking everywhere also catching the rug on fire. i start stomping the flames to death while trying to keep my balance just screaming \"fuck me! fuck me! fuck me!\". once the flames were put out i realized this girl was sitting on the toilet so high that she didn't even realize what just happened. so i pick her up, sit her on the couch, and proceed to trip and crawl into my bedroom and pass out.\n\ni woke up with the worst sore throat i've ever had and i still had no idea what being high feels like.\n [OUT] ",

you know something bad just happened but you don't really feel it yet. that's about where i was in that moment. \n\ni shout in pain and push her off. i look down at my boy and blood is shooting out of the front. literally shooting out. the viagra and high alcohol content are pumping out blood like the fucking bellagio fountains. \n\ni run to the bathroom holding my junk and jump into the bath tub. she comes careening in after me shout-asking what the hell happened. i shout-tell her to shut up and take a deep breath before examining the damage. \n\nturns out, her forceful mount and lack of lube put an abnormal amount of stress on my bowstring (frenulum is the technical term) and popped the little guy right in half. \n\nso here i am, sitting naked in the shower, unwillingly rock hard, drunk and bleeding an impressive amount. she becomes hysterical, starts crying and calls her dad. \n\nwhy her dad? well, apparently he's a doctor. apparently she thinks he can give her some advice or home remedy to fix my broken bowstring at 4 am in the morning. yeah. i don't think so. \n\nyou know what this guy says? \"why are you talking to me? take him to the hospital.\" thanks angela's dad. real helpful.\n\nafter about 15 minutes, the bleeding slowed slightly but i'm starting to feel pretty woozy. the shock of the situation finally subsides and i begin laughing uncontrollably. i think, \"this is what's happening to me right now. everything i've done in life has led up to me boner bleeding in the shower. this is what i have become.\" \n\nangela puts some clothes on and grabs the keys to my car. she tells me to get out of the shower and meet her out front to go to the er. i tell her she better yelp the best one because i'm not having some 4 star doctor handle my precious wounded hog. she's not very happy with me at that moment.\n\nas i shamble out of the shower and gingerly put some clothes on, i look around for the nearest object to carry my broken junk in. maybe a smart person would grab a towel but nope, i grab a wide mouth mason jar that was sitting on the counter and tuck my dick and balls in that. why both? it was just more comfortable that way. \n\nthe blood isn't coming out as much at this point but i still have an erection. pants pulled up to my thighs and holding the bloody mason jar between my legs, i walk outside and get in the car. \n\nwe drive the 5 minutes to an urgent care (5 star rated on yelp, of course) and i walk in there with all my glory showing and no fucks to give. there's a few people in the waiting room but the guy behind the counter doesn't want me sitting in there with them because my pants aren't pulled up so i get the vip treatment and see the doctor right away. \n\ni explain the situation to dr. ted while nurse caroline takes my mason jar and throws it away (i mean, i didn't want it back i guess). ted is in his late 60's and and caroline isn't far behind in age. ted gets the thing clean and puts pressure on it when he drops the bad news. \n\n\"op, the bleeding isn't really going to stop with out putting pressure on it. i don't want to stand here all night and hold your [glorious member] so we're gonna have to stitch it up.\" \n\nnope. \n\ni ask if there's anything else we can do. literally anything else. glue? bandaid? caroline puts pressure on it? no dice. \n\nin a last ditch effort, i ask for some sort of anesthetic but he explains that would be more painful than just getting the stitches. \n\ncaroline holds my hand. i glare at angela. ted puts 3 stitches in. i cried. we all bonded. \n\nangela and i drove back to my place in silence. she left back to her hotel shortly after we got back. we haven't talked since then but i like to think the conversation with her dad the next day was very awkward. \n\nthree days later i got the stitches out. ted and caroline weren't there so i had to explain the story to a whole new set of people. they laughed, a lot. i left them a 5 star review on yelp. \n\n \n\nedit: thanks for helping me get to the front page, all the kind words, and of course, the sweet sweet gold. i read all your comments and laughed a ton. my day has been made and i have a permanent smile on my face thanks to all of you.\n [OUT] ",

yeah, that slammed right into the corner of the cart.\n\nbecause i was holding it, the glass wasn't entirely shattered, but it made a spider web crack through the bottom pane of glass.\n\nmy friend shouts out \"what the hell was that?\" and i, while still pinned under the flat like it's 127 hours, for some reason just shout back \"i'm fixing it!\" in that moment, i gathered the strength of a thousand men and slid the whole thing across the room, knocking over a few set pieces from the other guy's set and plopped the thing down flat on the ground with a loud thud.\n\n\"seriously, what the fuck happened?!\" my friend shouts from his still standing flat. i emerge from the rubble with the water bottle in my hand. \"i was thirsty. now i'm gonna go find <equip. manager>.\" and i storm out.\n\nby this point, he was back in his office and the douchebag who left us in there to die never even told him anything was up. i explained the whole situation and he came to help with two other guys and together we got those two flats out of there. thankfully, we can make do without the window i smashed, so the entire shoot won‚Äôt suffer, but god damn, i just want to know where that random guy went. i also now realize that we easily could have just called someone to come help us out, but hey, hindsight‚Äôs 20-20.\n [OUT] ",

would *you*? anyway, i was so hungry that i, in my stupidity, did not recognize the cheesecake for what it was: a weapon. \n\n‚Ä¶maybe i should give you guys some background information here. **skip to the tl;dr, if you must, this will be a long, (and possibly a bit dark, i guess) read.**  \n\nsee, on any given day, my home has the potential to become a war zone and i like to say that all outcomes considered, i, a 22yof, have learned to cope with it pretty well. over the years, i learned to develop a way of living that would keep me sane without the use of drugs (besides sleeping pills), and maybe only a little bit of alcohol. this way of living isn‚Äôt cheap or easy, and to be honest, i‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs gone on as long as it has without being interrupted. before today, that is. anyway, the rules are thus:\n\n- if nothing else, do not accept his gifts\n- buy your own groceries, mini-fridge, microwave, and/or hot plate so that you can cook your meals in your room and avoid stolen food mishaps\n- have a source of entertainment in your room, be it books, a computer, a handheld gaming system or a tv with netflix to minimize contact with him in the outer rooms\n- everything you own, buy yourself so that he can‚Äôt take it away/destroy it as ‚Äòpunishment‚Äô or out of retaliation, and if he does, you can file a police report under destruction of property/robbery\n- under no circumstances accept his gifts\n- have a lock on your door, convince him that it was ‚Äòhis idea‚Äô so that he won‚Äôt feel inclined to assert his authority and break it\n- have some kind of income to pay for all this shit and make sure you‚Äôre also in school so that when you get home you can‚Äôt do anything but shower and hit your pillow\n- under *no fucking circumstances* do you *accept his gifts* \n \nsomehow, dear reddit, i managed to break my most important rule of all by eating that cheesecake. to put it simply, i fucked up. first of all, it wasn‚Äôt in my mini-fridge; i had no business looking in there in the first place. i was just so damn *hungry* and it was the middle of the night so i figured no one would notice and start an argument if something was missing. besides, it fucking had my name on it! it was practically begging me to eat it, for chrissake!\n\nas you may already have guessed, it was a setup. my stepfather had gone and intentionally put that traitorous, creamy, son-of-a-bitch motherfucker in there. he‚Äôd put it in there knowing that i would be hungry and exercising of poor judgement after a long day and he knew that i would take one look at the cheesecake and my sleep-addled brain would mistake it for a godsend. he knew that i couldn't buy groceries this week, and he fucking did it on purpose.\n\nsee, my stepfather is a sociopath. and, like most high-functioning sociopaths, at first glance, anyone with eyes would say that he‚Äôs a hardworking, family-oriented type of guy‚Äîyou know, your usual run-of-the-mill, morally upstanding breadwinner. sucks that his family doesn‚Äôt appreciate him, he tries so hard to be a good father. even refers to his stepdaughter as his own blood. wow, what a great guy. \n\nexcept, he‚Äôs not like that‚Äînot at all. he‚Äôs so good at acting like he is, though, that even if you gouged a hole in his carefully constructed facade with a jackhammer, you still wouldn‚Äôt get a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg (how‚Äôs that for metaphor?). he‚Äôs so good at it that, at times, i think he believes it himself. i say this because he‚Äôs gone to the er multiple times for ‚Äúchest pain‚Äù, and each time it‚Äôs after he‚Äôs done something horrific enough to cause a few outsiders to look a little closer.\n\nmy sister believes it‚Äôs (the chest pain) from guilt. i‚Äôm on the fence on whether he is capable of feeling guilt. i think it‚Äôs more along the lines of, ‚Äúi need the attention shifted away from the fact that i just pulled a move from wwe on my daughter‚Äîwho is totally lying about that by the way, *she* attacked *me*, i was acting in *self defense*‚Äîto how pitiful and in pain i am. i might die from the strain on my heart, says the doctor, and no one would care. woe. woe is me.‚Äù\n\n‚Ä¶i‚Äôm getting sidetracked again. the point is that i fucked up and ate the cheesecake. the cheesecake was so delicious that when i found out he‚Äôd put it there for me, i couldn‚Äôt imagine that he did it for an ulterior motive. i think my actual line of thought was, *how could something so good be used for evil?* and the sad thing was that already i was viewing him in a totally different light‚Äîi was feeling sorry for him and the fact that my mom was finally growing a pair and kicking him out. \n\ni found myself thinking that maybe she was just overreacting. i found myself thinking things like, \"so what if he destroyed her phone because there was a text he didn't want her to read on it? people accidentally send texts to group chats all the time!\" and,  \"so what if he'd intended for it to go to another (married) woman? that lady is totally cool, we've known her for years--she'd never be inappropriate, even if it was at 4:30 in the morning!\"\n\nnever did it cross my mind that i had unwittingly become ammunition in his fight to stay, even as i began to doubt that removing him from our home might be a solution to most, if not all of our problems. \n\nit is only now, as i sit here typing this and the cheesecake is undoubtedly congealing in my gut, do i realize how far under his thumb he has gotten all of us. it has been two weeks since my mother has told him to leave, and he is still fucking here. he even put all his things back into her closet. i can sense that my mother is slowly beginning to have doubts as well‚Äîi caught her eating a rocky road ice cream he left for her in the freezer this afternoon. needless to say i feel like i just swallowed a sack of bricks. \n\ni‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs going to be here for a while longer.\n [OUT] ",

(note: i have a a really bad habit of never saving things, often times i'll just leave the window open and not save it). fastforward many hours to 8 p.m. i finally finished most of my application and there are only couple essays left which i left to do over the weekend. so like a complete dumbass i haven't saved but i was just sitting and gave a sigh of relief. here i was thinking i was finally done and could relax and enjoy the rest of my snowday. now my application was currently split into two, the small 1% i had done earlier and the majority of the app. so, in order to combine the two, i open a new doc and copy the majority of the app, after copying that part i close the window and click do not save changes. then all of a sudden my mom yells. distracted by her yelling i go ahead and copy the other 1%. after she fi sines i head to the new doc and paste. only the the small 1% pops up. confused i keep repeatedly pressing ctrl+v only the 1% pops up. where the fucking hell is the resr of my application?!?!. then it dawns on me. i just sit there wide eyed and slowly twitching. i frantically rush trying yo re-open words and... nothing, the one time i actually needed an auto-save file there's nothing there. i try googling everything searching for a answer. after an hour i had pretty much lost all hope, when there's a sudden glimpse of hope. i read that mac has a temp folder for documents like these. rushing, i open the folder, sure enough there are a some rtfs in there (rich text files) i start opening some up and sure enough there are some old documents i never saved. i proceed through the list and arrive at the the file that was edited today. holding my breath i open it, thinking it's my saving grace and.... gibberish. it's all character gibberish without a single english letter . all the other files were perfectly fine, but the one file i needed the most recent file was corrupt. i sit paralyzed and proceed to scream every curse known to mankind. i had to finish most of the app today otherwise i wouldn't be able to finish the essays over the weekend. so i open a fresh doc at 8 pm and start working once again. fast forward to 3 am and it's done. i sit there in the middle of the night holding this app like gollum in lotd going \"my precious\" so long story short in a supreme fu i wasted a perfectly good snow day.\n [OUT] ",

is plausable. sometimes it's just ridiculous. for example a few years ago, their was a 5 year old in bangladesh who was quite smart. he could spell words where at the time i could barely say. bare in mind that i'm really shit at spelling but never the less my dad ended up comparing me to him. he started browsing videos of how much more smarter this child was then me. he then happened to come across the child playing super mario 64 i think it was. he instantly clicked away saying why would such a smart child play video games. he then praised this child as if it was the second coming of christ and proceeded to rant at me on why i was a stupid child. i then remarked that he didn't know how to spell or know the meaning of anythese words let alone pronounce them. he then told me to shut up and continued on his preeching of the second coming of christ and how i was basically the anti christ. bare in mind he acutally didn't talk about christ as i live in \"muslim\" household.\n\n my mom is a reasonable person. she listens to to logic. unless in involves religion or my farther.\n\n so i'm a huge game fanatic. i also consider myself a critic albeit a shit one. that makes me resistant to the shit ubisoft likes to feed me. i mostly pc game but i own consoles aswell. i'm not allowed to go outside not even to go to my freinds house. the only time i go out in my free time is when i went comicon months ago with my freinds but that took hours of begging and me being ignored. so naturally gaming is my only form of escapism. i also read books like game of thrones and such. i play with freinds. but this all stopped when i came home after having gcse 6th period basically meaning i'm coming home late. but i have to go to a mosque and learn the quran their. now i haven't gone in weeks due to school and i wasn't planning on going today either. my parents however had other plans. they told me to go. i asked them nicely can i not go. they started cursing at me and saying i was possesed. i consider my agnostic but am irl a muslim. if i told them i was agnostic the shit they'd pull would be extremely hostile. so i don't. my dad said okay he have doesn't have to go. he then proceeded to take everything in my room starting my pc. he even took my shitty chair. all he left me with was my bunk bed that i share with brother. he told me that the pc was the reason i abandoned god. he then had the audacity to set my pc up in his room. bare in mind that he often goes on my pc for my video editing software that i help him with. \n\n skip a few days and i haven't talked with him. he had my phone but my mom gave it back. i try to stay away from home but they call the school and asked them to monitor me. it's saturday now. my dads files got deleted because he's a fucking moron when it comes to computer. so he got really angry at me. he came into my room and decided to blame his incompetence on me. i told him i didn't do anything and he decides to smash everything in my room,sweep my shelves and kick my shit around till everything was broken. my revisions guides,essays years of work and my drawing all destroyed. now my bedroom smells of orange juice and my leg is bleeding from broken glass. \n\ni system restored the computer but hes acting as if i dont exist. nothing is appealing him.\n\n all i want to do is go back to gaming. gaming media has tuaght me all i know. not to take shit from companies l learnt from total biscuit and jim fucking sterling son. i learnt not everyone is a douchebag on youtube from inthelittlewood. i learnt that not all companies are ubisoft from devolver digital's games. i learnt fancy words from yahtzee which helped me in debate club. \ni don't want to report my family or anything. i don't want to lose my mom (even when she's unreasonable when my dads around sometimes). i don't want to leave my brother. i just want go back to gaming.\n\nreddit i need your help.\n [OUT] ",

The summary should be one or two sentences long.\n [IN] Text: okay i‚Äôll start off by saying that this didn‚Äôt happen today, but exactly a week ago (pancake tuesday for the christian homies). tl;dr at the bottom. \n\n\ni, like many others, am currently suffering with a case of bcs syndrome (broke college student syndrome). the symptoms can be quite horrendous, and can often land you in some pretty sticky situations. for example, the opportunity of receiving things for free is one not to be ignored. yes, the mere mention of the word ‚Äúfree‚Äù in a college email or pamphlet is bound to result in a crowd of dozens of students, clambering to get their free pen or condom or whatever the student union decided to give away this week.\n \nthere are however, risks when availing of such things. \n\nit was 9am, i stumbled into class to see my excited friend throw me her phone, offering me an email to read (an email that i, and everyone had also received, but who in god‚Äôs name has the energy to check their email before midday?). i didn‚Äôt read the email properly of course, as the only thing i noticed were the words ‚Äúfree pancakes‚Äù. of course we promptly told our other friends and they too were thrilled at the idea of free food, so we copied the address into google maps, and made our way to the mysterious building of free pancakes. \n\ni should inform you at this stage that i am an atheist, i was raised by atheists who allowed me to choose my own religion, was sent to catholic school (it was hard to find a non-religious school in ireland in the 90‚Äôs) and, around age 15, i decided that i didn‚Äôt believe in any of the religions that were presented to me. i should also say that i have absolutely nothing against religion, i have respect for people regardless of what they believe in, and it‚Äôs just not for me. also, most of the people in my class are atheists, including everyone that accompanied me on the ‚Äúfree pancakes‚Äù adventure.\n\nso we got to this house, my friend with the google maps stopped, ‚Äúthis is it!‚Äù, she said, an uneasy smile on her face. we all knew something wasn‚Äôt right about this. we had ended up in a housing estate, a cul de sac, a suburban array of houses. and here we were, six 20-something year old girls, standing outside this pretty normal looking house. (usually, when the college has any sort of  event or cook-out, it occurs on campus, in the student centre or one of the surrounding buidings, not in some house..)\n\nwell of course we had to at least ring the doorbell, there was free food at stake. \n\nwe were greeted by this rather friendly (but very rather old) priest. yes, a priest. needless to say we were seriously confused at this point. ‚Äúah come in, come in! put yer bags in the spare room there. come into the kitchen!‚Äù.  we subtly looked at one another and then threw daggers at the girl who originally suggested this trip. ‚Äúah go on in there to the sitting room and i‚Äôll make ye a cuppa tea!‚Äù, said the priest, who we had now learned was called fr. dave. \n\nwe entered the sitting room, which was surprisingly full of students! each wall was lined with chairs so there was about 20 students plus us, so this came as quite a relief as we honestly thought we were the only ones to have shown up. \n\nwell the pancakes were glorious. there was a table packed with jars of nutella, honey, syrup, marshmallows, and cream. and i must say that was the best cup of tea i‚Äôve had in a while. yes, it was all going great. then they started to talk about god. now i would‚Äôve been perfectly okay with that, i would‚Äôve went along with it out of politeness, if i knew anything about god or the bible.  we were sat in a circle and as we went around, we thanked god for something good in our lives, then we asked one another what our favourite part of the bible was. i have never read the bible, but it sure seems like an interesting book. yes, our little act was coming along quite nicely; we had thanked god for generic college related crap (like good grades or friends and such), we even managed to get through the bible part by making up some crap about not being able to choose the best part and bashfully smiling at the rest of the people present. but then came the prayer. \n\nof course (and this was also out of pure politeness, we did eat their pancakes after all) we awkwardly sat and kind of half mimed the prayers that we obviously didn‚Äôt know (i knew the our father from primary school but that was it). it was going pretty great, that is until one of my friends started getting looks from the guy across from her, as he had obviously copped that she was miming.\n\nshe threw a hissy fit. now, she didn‚Äôt scream or anything, but she did storm out of the room in a huff whilst saying something along the lines of ‚Äúi‚Äôm not f*cking religious anyway, i just wanted free pancakes for f*ck sake‚Äù. now, in ireland, it is the norm to be polite to people, it is also the norm that one is to be very polite and courteous when one is a guest in someones house, and to also be extremely polite to priests. so obviously, you can see where this was going. \n\nto say we were embarrassed is an understatement. there was a second or two (it honestly felt like hours) when the rest of us just sat there, everyone staring at us, before we realised it was time to go, and fast. we booked it out of there, collected our bags, and headed toward the door, trying to thank the priest for his hospitality like nothing happened.\n\nwell it is once again tuesday, and we received another email. ‚Äúfree tacos‚Äù. my friend actually wants to go back there because she thought they were so nice and they would ‚Äúsurely understand if we explained our situation to them‚Äù. i‚Äôm not sure the tacos are worth it.\n [OUT] ",

(by pretending to be santa of course!) and basically got a good list of what she wanted. couldn't mess anything up right? wrong! first off i couldn't give her a gift until sometime after christmas. (today to be exact).\n\non the list had some standard stuff, movies, food and such but i didn't want to give those. so being the classy guy i try to be i saw that on the list she wanted a bracelet and i'm like cool can't possibly mess this up! (wrong again my friend). my plan was after i am done visiting family from all over i come back buy her a bracelet. well then my head starts to spin. she has a boyfriend... can't make this too serious. so i buy a fast food card (we both work fast food and i know she is sick of it) only a 5 dollar amount. after that nice save. i'm like ok time to buy it i guess. (let the fucking up begin). i run in run out bam nothing awkward happens. after i walk out of the store though... i immediately have a buyers remorse, but it wasn't enough to turn me over and return it. now when i got home that's when it hit me. constantly just saying to myself \"maybe just a movie would do.\" but what prevented me for changing was telling myself i'm terrible and second guessing myself. like most of the time i second it's bad. after that convincing thought i'm like this gift ain't that bad! and set off on a journey to fuck up island.\n\nthe journey was actually quite easy and smooth sailing, did some last minute changes with the present stuff and was going to give her the present right when she got off work. (in the back of my mind it was still a bad idea). so i give her the card. i had a good laugh at least. (i told her that's all i got her.) then comes the greatest blunder... the bracelet. i handed it to her and i start to feel a vibe of awkward in me. so i kinda shake it out and gave it. after when i gave it i realized the mess i made..she started to blush.. but not the thank you blush (at least i think). it was the oh you really shouldnt have blush. realizing this i pretty much played dumb. (luckily that is easy as i am sometimes clumsy at work). when i go to the break room i slap myself... just slap myself. \n\ni'm really tempted to say \"oh i forgot to give you this movie (being the interview)\". should i do that? i realize beyond a doubt it was a shite gift. or at least she did not like the style of the bracelet or i missed some thing when i bought it that she noticed.\n\n \n\nif anything is misspelled, i didn't reread only because i typed this all on my phone.\n\nedit: fixed some misspellings now that i am on a computer. edit2 formatting and updates\n\n**more to the story** her day seemed to go well too actually, when i got there she was happy and laughing. she asked where was the gift (as the gift is very late) and i am like in my car... she didn't believe me and in my head i was like i will give it to her at the end of break. (should of just pretended i forgot) gave it to her, and that smiling face turned into redness... yup good job me!\n\n**i will keep you guys updated about tomorrow if you want me too** (hoping for the best!)\n\nupdate: more than likely she is coming in tomorrow, ill try to play it cool... (she might interrogate me though... we will see)\n\n**update 1: just about an hour from going into work, freaking out but sticking with the plan. also i got a million scenarios in my head but no problem... again hoping for the best and i will try to keep you guys updated at work.**  \n\n**update 2: at work let the fun begin**\n\n**update 3: she is not her, but being the detective me. i look at the schedule and bam she is supposed to work today... she got her friend to go instead... umm there is only one other reason why she wouldn't be here but i won't say that here. now... if her friend asks or even mentions about the gift how should i react... cause i'll just say something on the lines of yeah i fucked up.**\n\n**update 4: so after about a week, we haven't seen each other at work. we have been off and on at texting each other (mostly off) and she called me to take her spot on sunday. that wasn't a problem. i think she is busy in her life right now, and i don't think that we are not talking to each other just because of some stupid bracelet. we are working saturday and i think sunday. i will fill you in on the news when that comes around.\noverall: no real drama, but at the same time less communication... (oh by the way i did not start texting her she came to me. so i guess that is a good sign. the bracelet couldn't of possibly been worse than her finding out i liked her... nervous laugh...)**\n\n**update 5: ok little did i know but she is working today with me and it's actually been quite alright! i walk in, and start working and i was showing no signs of awkwardness about the whole situation (yaay i did something!). we are talking yada yada yada then boom... she says something about the christmas gift (joking about it but i didnt know.) i say something krass and she was like wooooooooow and i am wearing the bracelet! she pulls her sleeve up and behold she is wearing it! my jaw drops as i am unbeliever shocked that she is actually wearing that horrible present i got. there were no words on how surprised i was. after that little squabble we get back to work because all the cars on earth decoded to come to our freaking restaurant. after the masses get their food i get sent on break. so i say all is good right now.**\n\n**update 6: probably going to be my last update... we will see! anyways we worked today and there is no hint of awkwardness (given we worked in the morning and it was super busy, and well im not really too energetic when i have to work in the morning). still need to work on my awkwardness though, but all is well. so i guess this whole problem was just a minor thing. hooray for minor fuck ups!**\n [OUT] ",
