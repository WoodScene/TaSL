Obviously, I wasn't walking round with a year's season in my head, so I had to scramble to do a lot of things very quickly.\nIt's been incredibly busy while tending to Matilda in the background and releasing Pride in the autumn as well, so it was full of exciting, breathtakingly hopeful moments and crushing disappointments when projects fell to pieces.\nYour new season starts with a new play, Future Conditional by Tamsin Oglesby. How important is it to bring in new work?\nIt's a very important thing. The thing about choosing the first play is that it's ridiculously symbolic. I've had this play for a while. It's got so many people in it, it's been hard to find somewhere to do it.\nIt's political, funny and thought-provoking and has a big, strong youth aspect. It reflects so many of the things I care about.\nWhat does it mean to you to be able to premiere Groundhog Day at the Old Vic?\nI was developing it beforehand. We didn't know where it was going to go. I thought that what we were really making was an intelligent, mainstream Broadway musical, with a lot in common with The Music Man and Our Town as American fables.\nIt needs a large audience and a large stage, and I wanted to start it in this country, so it's the perfect match.\nDo you feel extra pressure after your success with Matilda?\nMaking a new musical is a mountain to climb, and each time you say \"That's the last one, I'm not going to do it anymore.\" They are hard enough to do without added expectations.\nThey're so hard that actually a lot of the time, you don't think about the audiences or critics. You think of something much more immediate, problems like the scene or the set.\nYou can't predict how much people will like it, but what we can do is make the story have integrity. It's absolutely possible it could be a flop.\nIf you're worried about whether something succeed or fails, then don't even start on it. You have to have a bigger reason for doing it.\nWhat's your thinking behind your Â£10 preview ticket scheme?\nWhat I'm interested in is removing the obstacle of affordability for people who think they might be inclined to try out theatre.\nI'm not somebody who says that everybody has to love theatre, any more than everybody has to love football, but some people could form a really meaningful relationship with theatre and haven't because of the ticket price.\nWe've got to remove that. We've got make the experience feel less posh.\nHow do you think your approach will differ from Kevin Spacey's?\nIt will differ enormously in some respects and not at all in others. While he's been head of the building he's had an enormous number of people helping him, and those people are still here. So how the theatre functions is unchanged on many levels.\nI'll be pretty much invisible. I'm a director - I like hiding behind other people.\nBut there will be glamour as well, because there will be a lot of star actors passing though the theatre.\n[Kevin] could shake somebody's hand and get them to write a cheque. I can't do that, but they'll write a cheque for my ideas that I'm pitching or because Ralph Fiennes or Tim Spall is standing next to me.\nIt's funny because people used to to say: \"How can a Hollywood actor run a theatre?\" Last night people were asking if I was nervous about taking over from Kevin. It's like only Hollywood actors can run a theatre now!\nThe Old Vic's new season begins on 1 September.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The London Somalia Conference, co-chaired by the UK, Somalia and the United Nations, will be held in Lancaster House, a grand mansion in the exclusive district of St James's. Many of the delegates will stay in swish hotels nearby.\nThis is the third such London gathering since 2012, and there is an element of \"cut and paste\" to its agenda, which focuses on security, governance and the economy.\nThe official conference document emphasises how much progress has been made.\nBut its description of Somalia from the time of the first meeting still applies: \"Chronically unstable and ungoverned\", and threatened by Islamist militants, piracy and famine.\nThere has been some improvement.\nPiracy, which at its height cost $7bn (Â£5.4bn) a year, is much diminished, although there has been a recent resurgence.\nUS drones, African Union troops, Western \"security advisers\" and Somali forces have pushed al-Shabab from most major towns, although the jihadists still control many areas and attack at will.\nA recent electoral process resulted in a new and - for the time being - popular president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, nicknamed Farmajo, and more female and youth representation in parliament.\nSomalia is in a \"pre-famine\" stage rather than the full-blown disaster of 2011, in which more than 250,000 people died.\nBut it is perhaps surprising that the current water shortage will not be a headline topic at the conference.\nThe country is in the grip of its worst drought in decades. Four successive rainy seasons have failed.\nEven before you enter Burao Regional Hospital, in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland's drought-stricken Togdheer region, you hear the haunting, high-pitched wailing of malnourished children.\nOne boy, dressed in purple, stares blankly at the wall. \"His brain is damaged due to a prolonged lack of adequate nutrition,\" says Dr Yusuf Ali, who returned home to Somalia from the UK two years ago. \"He will never recover.\"\nAccording to Unicef, the number of children who are or will be acutely malnourished in 2017 is up by 50% from the beginning of the year, to a total of 1.4 million, including 275,000 for whom the condition is or will be life-threatening.\nMost are too sick to go to school or help herd animals, making the life of the country's many nomads even more precarious.\nPeople are already dying from hunger and diseases that strike those weakened by lack of food.\nSeverely malnourished children are nine times more likely than healthy ones to die from illnesses such as measles and diarrhoea.\nThe World Health Organization says there were more than 25,000 cases of cholera in the first four months of 2017, with the number expected to more than double to 54,000 by June.\nMore than 500 people have already died from the disease.\nIt is not just humans who are suffering.\nIn Somaliland, officials say, 80% of livestock have died.\nLivestock is the mainstay of the economy - the ports in Somaliland and nearby Djibouti export more live animals than anywhere else in the world, mainly to the Gulf.\nIn south-western Somalia, tens of thousands of drought-affected people have fled to Baidoa, clustering into flimsy, makeshift shelters on the outskirts of the city.\nThis area - known as the \"triangle of death\" - was the epicentre of the famines of 2011 and 1991.\n\"Al-Shabab is harvesting the boys and men we left behind on our parched land, offering them a few dollars and a meal,\" says one woman. \"Against their will, our children and husbands have become the jihadists' new army.\"\n\"The biggest problem in dealing with this drought is insecurity,\" says Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, president of South West State, in his modest palace in Baidoa.\nThe city, which is protected by a ring of Ethiopian troops, is right in the heart of al-Shabab country. \"The militants have closed all the roads so we cannot deliver help to those who need it most.\"\nThis brings home in the starkest of terms why security is top of the London Somalia Conference agenda.\nAs long as Somalia remains violent, with different parts of the country controlled by a multitude of often conflicting armed groups, it will be impossible to deliver emergency assistance, let alone long-term development.\nThe recently created South West State is one of the regions making up the new federal Somalia.\nCritics fear this will lead to balkanisation, and risks introducing another dimension to conflict, as the new states rub up against each other and start fighting. This has already happened in central Somalia, where last year there were deadly clashes between Puntland and Galmudug states.\nThe attitude of people in South West State shows how much of a gamble the federal system is.\n\"We have always been marginalised and looked down on by other Somalis,\" says a farmer, Fatima Issa.\n\"We do not want the federal troops here. They don't hunt down al-Shabab the way our local militias do. We should push for more autonomy, maybe even break away and declare independence like Somaliland did in 1991.\"\nOne aim of the London Somalia Conference is to push for more progress on the sharing of resources between the regions and the centre. This contentious issue has been debated since before the first London gathering in 2012.\nSouth West State has a special friendship with Ethiopia, which is not on the best of terms with the new federal government. This highlights another possible problem - some foreign powers have started to sign bilateral agreements with regional states.\nFor instance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is building a military base in Somaliland, a territory the federal government considers an integral part of Somalia. The UAE has also given military hardware to Jubaland State in southern Somalia.\nSomalia's former special envoy to the US, Abukar Arman, has described the London Somalia Conference as a \"predatory carnival\", with foreign powers gathering to slice up Somalia for their own benefit.\nSome in Somalia see it as a waste of time.\n\"It is an expensive talking-shop,\" says Ahmed Mohamed, a rickshaw driver in the capital Mogadishu. \"The politicians and diplomats are obsessed with the conference instead of taking action on the drought.\"\nBut lessons have been learned, and there is now a far more nuanced approach to Somalia than there was when the crisis began, in the late 1980s.\nThe US response to the Somali famine of 1991 was to send in nearly 30,000 troops. This ended in a humiliating withdrawal, following the shooting down of two US Black Hawk helicopters in 1993.\nNow, much of the talk is of \"Somali-owned\" processes, although the shadows of a growing number of foreign powers can be seen lurking in the background.\n [OUT] ",

It is the most powerful armed group in Burkina Faso and often disrupted the activities of the transitional government as it tried to cling to the privileges it enjoyed under Mr Compaore's rule.\nIt is seen to be close to him, and is not popular on the streets. So its seizure of power could be a recipe for serious violence.\nThe transitional government might have made two mistakes - preventing politicians loyal to Mr Compaore from running in next month's elections and allowing the Reconciliation Commission, formed to heal wounds after the end of his authoritarian rule, to release a report calling for the presidential guard to be disbanded.\nSome argue that a newly elected president would have had greater legitimacy to take such action.\nMr Compaore is currently in exile and was accused of committing widespread abuses, and trying to change the constitution to extend his term in office.\nSome of his key allies had been barred from contesting the election.\nGen Diendere has said he has had no contact with Mr Compaore and will do everything to \"avoid violence that could plunge the country into chaos\".\nAn earlier announcement on state television said wide-ranging talks would be held to form a new interim government that would organise \"peaceful and inclusive elections\".\nTransitional parliamentary speaker Cheriff Sy called for people to \"immediately rise up\" against the coup, and declared himself the leader.\nThe coup was announced on the day that a judge was due to give the results of DNA tests on the remains of former President Thomas Sankara, his widow Mariam Sankara told the BBC.\nHer husband was killed in a 1987 coup that saw Mr Compaore and fellow officers such as his close friend Gen Diendere take power.\nThe family want to know the exact circumstances of his death, which have always been shrouded in mystery.\nThe 'heroes' of Burkina Faso's revolution\nThe rise and fall of Blaise Compaore\nGuide to Burkina Faso\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The narrowing of the gap reflected a 2% increase in exports of goods and services, taking them to £43.8bn.\nImports fell by 0.5% to £48.3bn.\nAlthough the pound fell sharply after the Brexit vote, which should make UK products cheaper abroad, the ONS said it was too early for firm conclusions.\nThe pound was 15% lower against other currencies in July compared with the same time a year ago, the ONS said.\nThe ONS points out in its release that the general consensus among economic commentators is that the recent depreciation in the pound should boost export and manufacturing competitiveness.\nHowever, it says this does not necessarily occur as the price of imported materials used to make UK goods rises as  the pound falls.\nAnalysis: Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent\nDevaluation: the economic equivalent of caffeine. Drop the value of the pound by a tenth and your exporters get a stimulus; suddenly their goods are 10% less in dollars - making them cheaper and therefore more competitive. In the last week and a half, two striking economic updates have been published,suggesting the weak pound has helped.\nToday it is the trade deficit. The fact that we as a country buy more than we sell - also known as a trade deficit - has been a persistent problem in the UK for at least two decades. But in July it narrowed by £1.1bn to £4.5bn. The other data was from manufacturers last week, who said the weak pound had helped stimulate the biggest jump in orders and new business for 20 years.\nIf that effect were sustained then it could help to achieve something the last government only talked about - the re-balancing of the economy. First, away from property and financial services and towards manufacturing and engineering - \"making things\" (remember the \"march of the makers\" - the phrase is four years old and empty). And second, away from our chronic dependence on borrowing and financial services to sustain economic growth.\nHowever, be careful. As Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation pointed out to me on Twitter, finance may be smaller than it was before 2008, but so is manufacturing. And the trade deficit narrowed - but by less than most economists had hoped.\nA weak pound may have stimulated the economy, but it has not suddenly improved our underlying economic fitness. Like caffeine, it will eventually wear off.\nHoward Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures were more evidence of the UK economy's \"current resilience\" - despite fears the Brexit vote would stall investment and spending.\nHe said hopes were pinned on the weakness of the pound encouraging a long-term increase in exports.\n\"A major hope for the UK economy going forward is that the substantial overall weakening of the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June's referendum will increasingly feed through to boost foreign demand for UK goods and services,\" Mr Archer said.\n [OUT] ",

He told the BBC that when he noticed suspicious activities he tried to alert some of his superiors.\nHe said that his superiors warned him that his family would be killed if he told anyone about what he knew.\nDespite the threat, Sgt Mora reported his suspicions to the attorney general's office at the end of 2008.\nThe evidence he provided led to the conviction of a number of members of his former brigade.\nIts former chief of operations, Jesus Rincon Amado, was sentenced to 35 years in jail for a murder committed in 2007.\nCol Santiago Herrera Fajardo, who commanded the brigade, is currently on trial.\nProsecutors are also investigating members of the 4th Brigade for at least 44 alleged extrajudicial killings carried out between 2001 and 2003.\nDuring that time, the battalion was under the command of Gen Mario Montoya, who was later promoted to lead the Colombian Army.\nEarlier this week, the attorney general's office announced that it had summoned the now retired Gen Montoya and three other generals to give evidence in July.\nAccording to the HRW report, the battalions which were led at the time by the current commanders of the Colombian army, Gen Jaime Lasprilla, and of the armed forces, Gen Juan Pablo Rodriguez, are also among those being investigated.\nColombia's President Juan Manuel Santos defended the two officers.\nHe said that both men had shown him documents which demonstrate that \"there is not one single investigation against\" them.\nPresident Santos said that although wrongdoing should be punished, that the army should not be \"tarnished\".\nHRW says the investigations have been hampered by threats and attacks on key witnesses.\nA ministry of defence official told the BBC that they were \"providing every possible protection\" to the witnesses.\nLt Col Carlos Javier Soler Parra said that the government had put a protection scheme in place for members of the armed forces who have acted as witnesses.\nBut Sgt Mora has said that he fears for his life.\nIn its report, HRW also quotes prosecutors as saying that members of the armed forces \"placed obstacles in the way of obtaining files crucial to their investigations\".\nIn a statement, the army denied this, arguing that it had put teams in place specifically tasked with providing the required information to investigators.\n\"We are the first ones interested in clarifying the facts,\" it said.\nRegardless of the obstacles, the attorney general's office is currently investigating at least 3,700 extrajudicial killings that took place within more than 180 battalions and other tactical units, according to HRW.\n [OUT] ",

But some are sincere.\nAs one Vatican insider put: \"The Pope's job description is to spread the word, and Twitter is a good way of doing that.\"\nAnd being limited to the use of just 140 characters should not be too much of a hindrance.\nThe Christian message has often been at its most powerful when it's been at its most succinct.\nThink of the Ten Commandments; \"Thou shalt not kill\" - just 16 characters.\nThey focused on promoting the Church's recently launched Year of Faith - an initiative intended to re-energise Catholicism.\n\"How can we celebrate the Year of Faith better in our daily lives?\" the pontiff asked.\nAnd he answered: \"By speaking with Jesus in prayer, listening to what he tells you in the Gospel and looking for him in those in need.\"\nBenedict's English account already has more than 700,000 followers and is growing fast.\nSo far, the Pope's accounts @pontifex - which mean \"pontiff\" or \"builder of bridges\" -  are only following each other.\nLast year, the Pope sent his first tweet from a Vatican account to launch the Holy See's news information portal.\nThe leader of the world's 1.2 billion or so Roman Catholics is expected to sign off, rather than write, each individual tweet himself.\nThe Pope's tweets are also expected to highlight messages from his weekly general audience, Sunday blessings and homilies on key Church holidays as well as papal reaction to world events.\nThe Vatican has long shown interest in using the latest communications technologies to spread the faith with the inventor of radio, Guglielmo Marconi, setting up Vatican Radio in 1931.\nThe Catholic Church also already uses several social media platforms, including text messages and YouTube, to communicate with young people.\nPapal aides say the pontiff himself still prefers to communicate in longhand rather than using a computer keyboard.\nPope Benedict's six-year papacy has been bedevilled by poor communications.\nEmbarrassing clarifications had to be issued over such thorny issues as his 2005 speech about Islam and violence, and his stance on condoms and HIV.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] The Property Redress Scheme (PRS) does not take effective action, they say.\nThe PRS said it was not a regulator and could only help when an agent acted legally.\nBy law, letting agents cannot trade unless they are a member of one of three schemes, including the Property Redress Scheme.\nHowever, dozens of customers of one rogue agent in London said when things went wrong, victims were not protected, a BBC You and Yours investigation has found.\nDoni Soeyono bought a small two bedroom terrace house in Stanley Road in Ilford, east London 18 months ago as a rental property.\nHe signed up with Carter Stones, just round the corner in Connaught Road, which promised him a couple would rent the house for about £1,300 a month.\nBut in reality the couple Carter Stones claimed were renting the property did not live there.\nInstead up to eight other people do, none with a contract. Mr Soeyono has not received any rent for six months.\nHe managed to get inside the house in the autumn and took pictures showing the sitting room with several beds.\nWhen I went to the property with Mr Soeyono, we were shouted at by two women, who told us to go away. Then they left and walked down the street.\nMr Soeyono says he's seen one of the women a number of times and believes she lives in the property, helping to operate a subletting ring involving about 16 people.\nBut the owner says he has not had any useful response from Carter Stones.\nSeveral landlords have contacted You and Yours complaining about unpaid rent, or legal documentation, and claim multiple people are living in the properties without any right to be there.\nFor more than 30 years, Teresa's family have owned a two bedroom terraced house in nearby St Mary's Road, Ilford.\nShe signed a management agreement with Carter Stones and was assured that a couple would be living in her house.\n\"Alarm bells rang when the council contacted me to ask who was responsible for the council tax at the house,\" Teresa said.\n\"They said many people were living in the house, but not the couple on the tenancy agreement.\"\nTeresa says the people we met coming out of Mr Soeyono's house are also organising the subletting not only of her house but also her garage.\n\"I saw curtains up in the garage window, and the door was blacked out, but they would not let me in.\n\"Carter Stones declined all responsibility for this. They were not transferring me the rent and I couldn't get any sense out of them, even after telephoning them on a daily basis,\" she told me.\nI tried to talk to Carter Stones, but while I could see two people in their office, each time I knocked they hid behind the door.\nSince 2014 it has been a legal requirement for letting agents to be a member of one of three government-approved dispute resolution schemes: the Property Redress Scheme, the Property Ombudsman or the Ombudsman Service.\nThe Property Redress scheme costs £200 to join. It is run by the insurance company Hamilton Frazer, and unlike the two other organisations it is run for profit.\nCarter Stones used to be a member of the PRS.\nLast year the PRS upheld four complaints against Carter Stones but the company failed to pay compensation of £15,406. The PRS cannot enforce that order - the only redress it has is to expel rogue traders.\nSo in March 2016 the PRS expelled Carter Stones, making it illegal for the firm to continue trading. When Carter Stones stayed in business, Trading Standards became involved.\nRedbridge Trading Standards then fined Carter Stones £5,000, but the company did not pay, and continued to trade. Trading Standards is still investigating.\nIn November 2016, seven months after Carter Stones was expelled from the scheme, Shakeel Ahmed paid £2,350 as a deposit to secure a flat to rent.\nEven though the flat fell through, Carter Stones kept his money.\nSeveral other prospective tenants have since contacted me with the same story.\nWhen the landlords and prospective tenants complained to the PRS, they were told that as Carter Stones had been expelled from the scheme, nothing could be done.\n\"The PRS is pretty much useless,\" Mr Soeyono told me.\nTeresa said: \"The PRS is not effective at all, absolutely not in the case of a rogue agent. They're just using the scheme for their benefit.\"\nThe PRS does not require letting agents to sign up to a code of conduct, and does not publish a list of companies that have been expelled on its website.\nPaul Shamplina, who is on the PRS advisory council, said that none of the redress schemes are regulators, but are \"escalated complaint handling schemes put in place to prevent service related complaints from having to be issued in the court by consumers.\n\"This allows them access to a much quicker and cost effective remedy to resolve matters with property agents.\"\nHowever, he said that when companies do flout the law, redress schemes are powerless, and complainants must rely on Trading Standards.\nYou can hear more about this story on You and Yours on BBC Radio 4 on Monday at 12:150 GMT.\n [OUT] ",

It is hard to find a building that is not badly damaged. Many look as if they could collapse at any time.\nRubble from the buildings that were flattened by artillery fire, barrel bombs or air strikes block many of the streets.\nDozens of bulldozers have been working for more than a month to clear a path through the debris.\nEast Aleppo remains a deeply inhospitable environment.\nBut the UN estimates that 40,000 people so far, and more every day, have decided to come back here. They are moving into their old homes or unoccupied buildings that look as if they might do, for a while at least.\nAbu Hussein, a man in his 50s, was remarkably cheerful as he stood with his wife Umm Hussein and looked down from their balcony on to the rubble that makes his street impassable for any vehicle.\n\"Nothing is better or more beautiful than our home,\" he said. \"It's the place to be in good times or in bad.\"\nHis family's flat is in Shaar, one of the poorest quarters in East Aleppo. The area is made up mainly of cramped concrete tenements five or six stories high - at least those still standing.\nIn Abu Hussein's street, some buildings have collapsed in on themselves.\nOthers have had the fronts ripped off, like dolls' houses in a nightmare, exposing beds still made up with sheets and blankets, and sofas teetering close to falling into the street.\nAbu Hussein said he was happy because he was home, even though his flat was dark and cold.\nHis wife cooks on a small charcoal grill on the stairwell.\nThe glass in the windows has gone. It is so well ventilated that the dank mist of a winter's evening seeped in.\nHe had spent much of last year with his in-laws, he said, and the sooner they tried to make a go of it back home the better.\nAbu Hussein and his wife have a two-year-old son who is still with her parents. They have no jobs, and the small amount of money they had saved went long ago.\n\"Of course we have hope,\" Umm Hussein said. \"We'll rebuild and we'll find a solution.\"\nThey left East Aleppo two days before the start last year of the major offensive by the Syrian army, backed by Russia and Iran, which by Christmas had beaten the rebels and reunited the city.\nDuring the years when the east was isolated, then besieged, it was possible to cross to government-controlled West Aleppo.\nAbu Hussein said the trip, which now takes 15 minutes, was possible for anyone who was prepared to take a 17-hour journey through territory controlled by Syria's galaxy of armed groups, including the rebel Free Syrian Army, Kurdish militias, the jihadists of so-called Islamic State, and the armed forces of the Syrian government.\nThe United Nations, which spent more than $200m (Â£162m) on relief work in Aleppo last year, is particularly concerned that the poor in Shaar have come back out of desperation to a place that is still dangerous.\nRelief agencies have put water tanks in the streets. Children struggle through mud and rubble to help their families by carrying water home.\nAleppo has changed since the government and its allies won the battle for the city last month.\nIt no longer feels like a wartime city. Outgoing artillery fire is still a steady drumbeat, aimed at rebel front lines that are not far away.\nThe country is at war. But Aleppo's war is over. In the ruins, people are thinking about the future.\nSlowly but steadily, some of Syria's millions of displaced people are returning, desperate or optimistic, or both.\nLarge areas of the east side of the city are ghost towns, but there is every chance that more returnees will come back looking for a home once the weather gets warmer in the spring.\nThe battle for Aleppo was the most decisive of the war.\nIt is a long time since the war was merely a contest between President Bashar al-Assad and armed groups who wanted to destroy the regime.\nSo many foreign powers have intervened that this has become an international conflict. Syria has layers of war and not all of them are about the future of the Assad regime.\nThe intervention of Russia and Iran tipped the balance in Aleppo.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] Mr Osborne is meeting other finance ministers of the G20 group of major economies in Moscow.\nThe UK, Germany and France want to reform rules which let firms switch profits and costs between countries.\nLabour's Ed Miliband said he \"didn't see much evidence\" Mr Osborne was actually tackling the problem.\nSeveral well-known firms have been criticised over the amount of tax they pay on large UK revenues.\nThe BBC's Hugh Pym says the issue is \"high on the list of priorities for policymakers at a time when companies like Amazon, Starbucks and Google have come under fire over the size of their tax payments\".\nThe emergence of details regarding tax-avoidance strategies by multinational firms has sparked controversy, and calls for an overhaul of tax laws will be highlighted to finance ministers by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),  in a report published this week.\nBy Hugh PymChief economics correspondent, BBC News\nThe tax policies of Amazon, Google and Starbucks have intensified the debate about corporate behaviour and pushed it high up the agenda for policymakers.\nEveryone agrees there is a limit to what national governments can do to close loopholes in a world of globalised capital flows where big companies can easily move profits to low tax regimes.\nToday's G20 developments mark a move towards an international crackdown.\nGeorge Osborne and his French and German counterparts will be powerful advocates for change at future meetings.\nBut it is only a start.  And, as the chancellor has acknowledged, in a low growth climate governments need to take care not to deter multinationals who might invest in their economies.\nThe chancellor told BBC News: \"We want a tax system that makes it competitive for businesses to set up in Britain and create jobs, but we also want a tax system where business pay their taxes and that's what we're setting up achieving here with other countries at this meeting in Moscow.\n\"International companies are an important source of jobs - we want them in Britain. We are making sure the taxes in Britain are low but we do expect those international companies to pay those taxes.\n\"The international tax laws for these companies have not really changed in decades, even though the international economy has changed a lot - people shop online, for example - and so the only way to deal with that is to work with other countries to make sure the international tax laws change and then international companies will pay their fair share of taxes.\"\nBut Labour leader Ed Miliband said: \"George Osborne makes lots of promises on tackling tax avoidance, but I don't see much evidence of it.\n\"What he should be worrying about is the living standards of people in this country.\n\"Of course, he should be dealing with tax avoidance, but one of the things he's doing is cutting taxes for the richest people in society - Â£100,000 tax cut for the richest people in Britain - the wrong thing to do at a time when everyone else's living standards are squeezed.\"\nThe UK will chair a committee set up by the OECD looking at \"transfer pricing\" - how global firms calculate the payments passed between their subsidiaries in different countries - which can be used to shift profits from high-tax jurisdictions to lower-tax ones.\nThe committee is one of three looking at the tax issues which will help the OECD prepare a \"plan of action\" to be put forward to the G20 in July.\nGermany will head a panel looking at the ways in which companies have reduced their tax base - their taxable income and assets - while France and the US will jointly consider the problem of identifying the correct tax jurisdiction for business activities, particularly e-commerce.\nMr Osborne said Britain had cut its corporation tax rate by more than any other country in the G20 over the past two years, which he said was \"a message to the world that we are open for business that has seen companies return to Britain, and helping to create and secure thousands of jobs and millions in investment\".\nHe said: \"Our commitment to the most competitive corporate tax system goes hand in hand with our call for strong international standards to make sure that global companies, like anyone else, pay the taxes they owe.\n\"That's why Britain, with Germany and France, asked the OECD to scrutinise the international rules, and we will together welcome their report to the G20 this weekend. The report shows this is an international issue that requires international action.\"\nThe chancellor said global tax rules \"have stood still for almost a century\", adding that \"Britain will lead the international effort to bring them into the 21st Century\".\nHe wants to use Britain's presidency of the G8 in 2013 to push international progress on the reform of international tax rules, which were first developed by the League of Nations in the mid-1920s and remain essentially unchanged.\n [OUT] ",

Other patients were not in their beds, they were in pop-up cars. There were people dressed as ninjas at each side of the bed.\n\"I felt they were going to harm us and we had to be good.

I started to text people and tell them to come and get me.

He said the condition is not unusual.\n\"The symptoms are caused by the environment and the critical illness suffered. They are upsetting and unsettling for the family and friends who will also see what is going on. It is something we in the intensive care unit have been concentrating on for the last ten years,\" he said.\nInternational research has been focused on trying to improve how to spot the symptoms to treat the condition and the Critical Care Network has developed a number of scoring systems to try and pick it up at the earliest stage in patients.\n\"There are a series of cognitive tests to see if a patient is in the zone of delirium and that is what Frances has been experiencing, a condition called critical care delirium.\n\"There are a number of strategies which can be used to try and normalise the environment. Introducing night and day when that can be done, reducing sedation when possible and freeing patients from the equipment.

We are having good success at this.\n\"We never get the opportunity to let people know that delirium is a common effect of being in critical care and we are looking out for it and we can treat it.

He says ministers who want to campaign to leave the EU will be able to do so in the runup to the vote.\nBut on this subject, that has so divided the Conservatives in the past, how can he stop what will be an energetic debate in the party doing lasting damage?\nThe Downing Street headed notepaper, the clarifications of parliamentary precedent, and the careful words all look terribly polite.\nBut in David Cameron's three-page letter to his ministers this afternoon, there are some robust messages to his own side, and evidence of his own anxieties about the self-harm the Conservatives could indulge in during the coming months.\nIt was only last week that he succumbed to the (almost) inevitable and said that ministers will be able to vote according to their beliefs, and campaign to leave the EU in the referendum. But the PM clearly believes the decision alone is not enough. So, to try to rein people in, he's published a set of rules.\nFirst off, in no uncertain terms, ministers are told to keep quiet on the subject until he reaches a deal, expected in the middle of next month.\nBut even after the negotiations are complete, the letter states that ministers will only be able to give their overall positions on the basic question, stay or go.\nHe writes \"all other EU or EU-related businessâ€¦will continue to be subject to the normal rules of collective responsibility\".\nSo, a row between the Home Office and Brussels over a new European regulation?  A spat between DEFRA and the EU about environmental regulations?\nUnder David Cameron's rules, Eurosceptic government ministers would not be allowed to use evidence from normal government business to make the case to leave.\nAnd ministers who want to leave the EU won't be able to use the power, the drama of Westminster itself to argue for exit.\nNumber 10 will not allow Eurosceptics with jobs in the government to campaign for Out from the backbenches, nor will they be allowed to speak at length on the issue from the despatch box.\nIf they are asked a question by an MP that requires them to make reference to an EU issue, they will be able to point out their own position, while also referring to the government policy.\nBut that's as far as it goes, whereas the prime minister, and those who are expected to campaign to stay will be able to argue for the government position, almost inevitably making the case to stay.\nTonight, it's prompted accusations there simply is one rule for one side, another for the other. Campaigners for Out are gleefully pointing out tonight that ministers are being given less licence to express their views than Liberal Democrat ministers were under the coalition.\nThe civil service won't be neutral, and will support the government's position \"in the normal way\".\nEurosceptic cabinet ministers I've spoken to are relatively relaxed about the suggestions, but with one important caveat, that the prime minister does not use the immediate aftermath of the summit where he agrees the deal, to hail it as a huge breakthrough before they are allowed to make their case.\nWith summits finishing on Friday afternoons, and the Cabinet traditionally meeting on Tuesday mornings, there are nerves about a vital 72-hour gap where the campaign to stay could suddenly have huge advantage.\nMost telling perhaps is what the letter tells us about the political dangers of this project, probably the biggest risk David Cameron has ever taken.\nHe calls for Conservative ministers to remain a \"united, harmonious, mutually respectful team\".\nThe fact he feels the need to spell that out suggests just how worried he may be about polite disagreement descending into bitterness.\n [OUT] ",

It's an application that allows you to transfer files between devices simply using an audio signal. It was instantly appealing - and best of all it was the work of a British inventor, Patrick Bergel, from University College London.\nBergel and his team had big ambitions, seeing Chirp as a whole new platform for exchanging anything from photos and video to cash. At the time I wrote: \"This may be an app that just proves a passing craze - but how inspiring to meet a British start-up with such Californian ambitions.\"\nThree years on they have made some modest progress, running experiments with retailers using the app to send marketing messages, but it's fair to say this is still a brilliant idea rather than a proven business. Then today another company which also has plenty of Californian ambitions moved onto the same territory.\nThat business is Google, which has launched a plug-in for its Chrome browser called Google Tone. The idea is that nearby computers can share links by opening a Chrome tab, then sending out an audio signal. It's very similar to what Chirp does, although for now it has more limited applications.\nThat might seem like curtains for the tiny British venture, which has just embarked on a crowdfunding drive, using the Crowdcube platform to raise the modest amount of  money it needs to get to the next stage. But Patrick Bergel says the opposite is the case.\n\"I've been going on about 'the internet of sound' for a while, so we definitely see this as validation. Competition is a good thing.\" Until now, he has struggled to get London investors to back Chirp, explaining tactfully that they are \"not always as open to brand new ideas as Californian venture capitalists\".\nIt seems there is an appetite in the UK for me-too businesses - another social network or photo sharing app - but a reluctance to put money into original British technology.  But now Bergel thinks he might get a better hearing: \"If you're the only person in the marketplace it's hard to convince people that it's a good thing.\"\nWhat is more, Chirp had been on the point of releasing its own Chrome plug-in. Having heard about Google's Tone, it has rushed it out this morning, and says its version does more, allowing you to send all sorts of links, pictures even phone numbers from websites to another device.\nWhat happens next will tell us something about how the UK has come as a place to launch a new technology business. If Google's hunch is right, sharing files via an audio signal is an idea whose time has come. Venture capitalists should be beating a path to Patrick Bergel's door to find out about the internet of sound. But if he wants a hearing, maybe he'd be better off heading to California.\n [OUT] ",

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.\n [IN] As they prepare to go to the polls on Sunday for the second time in six months, only 3% put the need for a new administration among the country's top-priority issues, according to public pollster CIS.\nThe four main parties failed to reach a deal after December's inconclusive vote and there is little sign that things will change.\nFor Spaniards, though, a 21% rate of unemployment unsurprisingly remains the main concern.\nThere are signs that economic confidence is recovering as Spain emerges from the 2008-2013 double-dip recession known here as \"la crisis\".\nFirst-quarter figures for 2016 show GDP growth of 0.8%, the same as during the second half of last year, mainly thanks to a 0.9% rise in consumer spending.\nPodemos's Ikea-style appeals to Spain's youth\nKing calls new vote amid deadlock\nSpain's 'usual suspects' line up for fresh poll\nPodemos bangs on doors of power\nThey may embrace this partial economic recovery but Spain's voters are not crediting the conservative Popular Party (PP), which claims to have brought it about.\nThe PP, now a caretaker government, saw its support plummet from 45% at the height of the 2011 election to 29% on 20 December 2015.\nIt was enough to finish first but not to secure majority support. In the subsequent four-month lifetime of modern Spain's shortest parliament, the second-placed Socialists (PSOE) ruled out a grand coalition with the PP while negotiating a deal with the fourth-largest party, Ciudadanos (Citizens).\nBut repeat elections were inevitable when third-placed anti-austerity party Podemos refused to approve the deal.\n46m\nPopulation\n21% Unemployment\n45% Youth unemployment\n2.7% Growth in GDP predicted for 2016\nOpinion polls suggests little is likely to change on 26 June, although Podemos is now eyeing second place ahead of the Socialists, largely because of a coalition deal with the United Left, an amalgam of communists and other leftists.\nIn Sunday's Metroscopia poll published by newspaper El Pais, the PP led on 29%, Unidos Podemos had 26%, PSOE 20.5% and Ciudadanos 14.5%.\nWho would make deals with whom to form a majority was a big question for the only TV debate this month ahead of the vote.\nBut while all four leaders were adamant they understood that Spanish patience had worn thin, they gave little away.\nSo with only a month of negotiating time available before Spain's traditional summer shutdown period in August, the prospect of a lost year in politics looms ever larger.\nBelgium's record of 541 days without a renewed government may still be a way off, but the brinkmanship of Spanish politicians could have disastrous consequences.\n\"It does look like no-one wants to make a deal with anyone,\" says Pablo Simon, a politics professor at Madrid's Carlos III University. \"But I think this is basically down to electoral strategy because all the parties accept that there simply cannot be another election.\"\nMr Simon argues that decisions are needed to prevent a drop in public investment and to incorporate new spending cuts demanded by the European Commission into the 2016 budget, hurriedly passed by the PP in parliament last autumn.\nAccording to the president of Seopan, which represents Spain's construction industry, the building sector is heading towards a ninth successive year in crisis on the evidence of the first quarter of the year without a government.\n\"Investment in construction and infrastructure will fall by between 15% and 18% in 2016,\" Julian Nunez told a conference in Santander last week.\nBeyond the delicate economic circumstances, Mr Simon also warns of the dangerous potential for political disaffection if urgently needed reforms to boost employment, improve education and crack down on corruption are not forthcoming.\n\"If the current blockage continues and the economic situation and inequality worsen, we could reach a point where we find that Spain is not immune to the emergence of the far right,\" he says, noting that only Spain, Portugal and Ireland have so far been unaffected by the rise of extremist politics among European nations this century.\nPopular Party Acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said the party with the most seats in Congress should be allowed to govern. His PP will again propose a broad coalition with PSOE and Ciudadanos. But the Socialists are not interested and Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera says Mr Rajoy should step aside first because of the string of PP corruption scandals that emerged while he has been leader.\nSocialists Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez risks a shocking reverse if his historical party of the left is surpassed by Podemos. Polls suggest that together, Unidos Podemos and PSOE may scrape a majority or come very close. But Mr Sanchez and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias have become bitter political enemies after the latter effectively dynamited any chance of an understanding earlier this year by insisting on an independence referendum in Catalonia, anathema to the Socialists. Mr Sanchez may have an unpalatable choice to make: be the junior partner in coalition with Unidos Podemos or allow the PP to stay in power.\nUnidos Podemos The left-wing coalition wants an end to austerity politics and a massive investment in public services, as well as a minimum income guarantee for all households. This would be funded by significant tax rises for the rich and for companies. However, Mr Iglesias has hinted that a Catalonia referendum might not be a red line, a shift that would pile pressure on the Socialists to join a coalition.\nCiudadanos The anti-corruption centrist party has signed regional deals with both the PSOE and PP at a regional level, in return for a commitment to greater transparency. And leader Albert Rivera's February deal with Pedro Sanchez was a coup for Ciudadanos. But if the Socialists fade further in the polls, Mr Rivera may feel he is better served pushing for a deal with the PP, without Rajoy at its head.\n [OUT] ",
