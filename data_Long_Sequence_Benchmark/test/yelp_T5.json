The \\\"pizzas\\\" are very well priced...basically you can make your own toppings. I had a pizza with spiced ground meat, cheese, onions, some veggies...We also tried a chicken topped one which was very tasty. My only issue was that the spicy meat was not spicy at all and pretty \\\"meh\\\". The winner here is the crust that they bake on demand when you order. There is a small wait due to this, but nothing atrocious. Employees were very nice. We were the only girls in there haha. Seems to be frequented by younger Arab men. The sweets we tried (baklava and some other pistachio ones) were not the best. Shisha is available as well upstairs. Cheap eats!\n\nAnswer:",

I stayed home monday with him, the hubs stayed home tuesday with him. We had a cone on his head...Thursday we came home from work to find he had manuvered around the cone and had licked his stitches OPEN...it was bad. The vet was closed, and I had remember seeing the Emergency Animal hospital...so off we went. It was about 6pm.\\n\\nThey took the pup and said to wait or come back in 45 minutes so they could inspect him. After 45 minutes we got some bad news... the pup had licked it to the point that there was dead tissue and a raging infection. And it was going to cost close to $1,000. ::gulp::  They did say they could clean out the infection and stitch him up and we could take him to the vet the next day, but we didnt want to risk things getting worse just to save a few bucks. So he stayed there, over night. \\n\\nThe staff was really great (aside from the very unfriendly older receptionist) I called and check in on him at 11 pm and then again at 7am. Once we had him home I probably called the hospital AT LEAST 5-8 times asking random questions and they were always more then happy to answer them. \\n\\nPup had to have 2 drains put in, dead tissue and muscle removed, a ton of stitches...it was a tough 2 weeks of recovery...but he is back to his sassy puppy self.\n\nAnswer:",

It had a decent variety of flavors, along with some \\\"Ice Cream Cupcakes\\\" that I had never seen before.  Whole ice cream cakes in various sizes were also included in a stand-up freezer.  A few chairs and tables scattered about, but this is located near the plaza with plenty of outdoor seating near the big fountain, should weather permit.  \\n\\nOn this visit, I decided to get one of the ice cream cupcakes to try later - it was fine.  I purchased a Birthday Cake milkshake along with that, which wasn't blended particularly well, so the first sips were just sweet milk, followed by clumps of ice cream.  Again, fine.

We were there during happy hour BF got the house margarita and he liked it so much he had 2, or maybe 3. My Aunt and I split a margarita flight and opted for the frozen drinks.. came with prickly pear, mango and strawberry. All were on the sweet side but super tasty and VERY strong... we would have been falling off our stools if we each had a flight. I mixed the mango and prickly pear and it was muy bueno!\\nThe bad - they bring out a big bottle of water... it had stuff floating in it, we let the waitress know and she brings another.. stuff floating in this one as well.

I will admit that when my girlfriends and I ate there, we slid in about 6:45 (15 minutes to closing) and just a tad inebriated!  Our waiter was pretty awesome and let us get our order in immediately so we could take advantage of the fleeting happy hour prices.  \\n\\nWe ordered two Las Vegas rolls, tuna sashimi, a Ra-ckin Shrimp, and a round of Sake bombs.  By the end of the meal we were giddy, full, and more than willing to pay full price for dessert.  We ordered the coconut creme brulee and it was delicious, although it could have used a bit more coconut flavor.  It looked and tasted very much like a traditional creme brulee.  Our bill ended up being $100, but we all drank and ate pretty well.  We weren't overly stuffed, but just right.  \\n\\nLocated by the fashion mall, Ra Sushi is a must if you are looking for delicious sushi on a budget and are staying anywhere within walking distance; for us it was from the Venetian.

The decor is very minimalistic, that's okay it's a pretty casual burger joint and I was meeting a friend here for lunch so I'm not expecting much ambiance or else something has gone terribly wrong.\\n\\nSo you saunter up to that counter and you have a couple of choices for burgers.

It was filling and unmemorable, well maybe I'm to blame for that maybe I shouldn't order a classic burger if I want my taste buds titillated. Veggie frites? I was expecting something like crispy vegetables and they kind of ended up being a fairly small portion of oily limpdick veggies, at least they're salted nicely.\\n\\nTotal bill for lunch? $9 I might as well go to a nicer restaurant and pony up the extra $1 for a much more awesome burger.

Normally I am not big on atmosphere, but when its 80 degrees plus outside, I expect a comfortable temperature. I had to sit outside since the inside was stuffy, and the black curtains did not do my comfort level any justice. \\n\\nNow that I am done ranting a bit, lets get on to the food. At this point, unfortunately, it does not get any better. We ordered the Pasteles, a tamale with pork, plantains, raisins, and spices, for an appetizer, and it was not that great. The masa was a bit dry, and the flavors weren't as scintillating as I expected, especially for the price. \\n\\nFor our entrees we had the Ropa Veija (shredded beef in spices with black beans and rice), which once again was not anything spectacular. This was the highlight of the meal, which to me is sad. The beef was a bit tough and the moros (rice and black beans mixed) was dry. Sadly, our other entree was much worse. This title is held by the Pollo Cubano (marinated chicken breast with onions). The chicken was tender on the bright side, but it was covered with onions that were disgustingly soaked in lime. The flavor was overwhelming and I could taste nothing other than lime. \\n\\nConsidering the price, atmosphere, and quality of Havana Cafe's food I will never return.

The decor was nice but WAY to crowded in the main room. The video LCD paneled roof was a mindblowing visual effect because I have never seen anything similar. It goes with the beat and that really was neat. Then there are stripper poles for the girls to dance on with masses of horny men around them waiting to pounce. Drinks are $15 range and standard and not strong. The other rooms were a neat feature to seperate the masses according to their musical tastes such as House, and Hip Hop (crunk). The main room was crowded and to make it worse, VIP booths are jammed in adjacent to the dance floor. It was a hassle trying to dance and move through the crowds to get to the bar. The bar was even more crowded. People standing and linining up 2-3 people deep, even on the other side wall of the VIP booths opposite of the bar. It was very hard to walk through. I just stayed in the house room all night for the househead that I am. Even that place got crowded. But I enjoyed it only because of house music. So I suppose it was worth the $30 entry.\n\nAnswer:",

We waited for almost 15 minutes, no one came to apologize for the mess up, and what really pissed me off and finally decided to walk out of the restaurant is when I told the the owner about what happened, he replied and said regardless if we made a reservation or not, they are too busy, if they don't have a table ready for us, we just have to wait!

Don't bother.\\nLong version: From the moment we walked into the rental office to the day we moved out, this place was a stain.  My husband and I chose Talus as temporary living quarters based on proximity while awaiting the completion of our new home.  In retrospect, it was an impetuous and ill-informed decision.  I suppose our short-term status blinded us, but if you're on the lookout for long-term housing be warned.\\nWe had issues with:\\n*  Parking spaces -  We were told it would be two weeks before one was available.  Fine, except in reality there wasn't one available for the better part of TWO MONTHS. \\n*  Structure - It was so fucking loud in that place that we never once slept through the night while we lived here.  Never.  I know apartments have a reputation for paper-thin walls, but trust me, this isn't the first \\\"multi-family\\\" housing situation I've lived in, and the light fixtures literally swayed from the tenants above simply walking around.  I'm not exaggerating.  I won't even get in to the frequent toddler wrestling matches that took place above us.  \\n*  Staff - outside of the initial contract negotiations, nobody here gives a tin shit about the tenants.  Our infrequent complaints were always met with a scowl and were typically pawned off onto another party, if addressed at all. No complaint or conflict was ever sufficiently handled.  \\n*  Grounds - every conceivable surface was covered in dog shit. Constantly.  The pool was consistently green and littered with cigarette butts and spent beer cans.\\n*  Bugs -  Out of control. I've lived in Phoenix for nearly 20 years and have never experienced this many scorpions, ants or crickets.  I'll echo Chrysty C.'s previous complaint that charging for \\\"monthly\\\" pest control ought to negate any pest sightings.  It didn't.  We found several scorpions and countless crickets. We also spent many a night vacuuming ants from our bathroom and bedroom floors.  While the pests mainly infested the interior, the worst area was the water heater closet on the patio - the crickets were so numerous that we began referring to the closet as the \\\"Temple of Doom\\\".  Foul.  \\nIt's difficult to pinpoint which aspect was the worst.  Pure suffering for three months.\\nI feel it's important to point out that it's been two years since we lived here (June - September, 2008).  Maybe the situation has improved since we left.  Somehow I doubt it.   Regardless, I'm still upset about our time here, and I thought my fellow Yelpers should know.   Caveat emptor!\n\nAnswer:",

The one way out South on Las Vegas Blvd is the one we actually purchased our RV at. This Camping World is WAY out on Boulder Highway. The other one we've been to was in California.\\n\\nAll Camping World's are about the same. I believe most of them have places where they do work on RVs and of course the retail portion. Prices are steep for certain items. You are always going to see the normal price and the \\\"Good Sam\\\" price. You must be a member to get that price. We are members.\\n\\nThis particular CW had some pretty poor customer service. My husband inquired with a young lady working the cash register how much wax/cleaning agent we would need to buy in order to wash our RV. She didn't know and asked another individual working there - who also, didn't know. In the end my husband ended up doing math in his head depending upon how big our RV is versus how many liquid ounces, etc. So, the employees were pretty much useless here.\\n\\nI didn't find the actual store to be bad. Everything was clean and they do have a lot of selection for different items. It's just that I would hope the staff would be a bit more educated on the products.\n\nAnswer:",

However, there is no denying the sandwich is tasty and enjoyable.\\n\\nThere are few foods that encapsulates a city and are easily identifiable as a Primanti Bros sandwiches. Its as synonymous with Pittsburgh as the Steelers, the steel industry, and the Three Rivers. When ever I am in town I always swing by to grab one. I love it!\\n\\nThis sandwich's main attraction is its amalgamation of meat, cheese, coleslaw and fries. It was Epic Meal Time before EMT got big on the internets. That being said, its quite plain and, in all honesty, boring. The meats and cheeses are your standard deli meats. The slaw is pretty dull with no acid, color, or salt. The fries are, well, fries. The bread is super soft and thick, but that softness yields to the juices that can create a sloppy mess toward the end of the sandwich. Now, just when you think I'm hating on this beast, I do have to say that it tastes better than the individual components in an act of culinary synergy. This is definitely one of the places that I seek out after a late night when ever I'm in the 'Burgh.\\n\\nThe other things I don't like is that this place is cash only. I get it, but its very inconvenient. I wish I owned a restaurant that had the gravitas to be cash only, so I'm a bit jealous! The other thing is that the service is inconsistent. Some of the servers are very energetic and entertaining and very welcoming. In fact, on a recent trip, he forgot our beer when we ordered it. After reminding him we ordered beers, he gave it to us on the house. Now THAT is service! The most recent time, I walked in after my train got in to the Amtrak station at 5:30 am. It seemed that the people working there were confused that someone was in so early. It took a long time to order and an inordinate amount of time to get my food despite being one of three people in the place. Oh well, life goes on.\\n\\nAnyway, this place is an institution. A trip to Pittsburgh isn't complete without stepping into the hallowed ground of Primanti's and scarfing down a piece of Americana!\n\nAnswer:",

I felt like every place I went to was in the process of kicking some guy out or had someone handcuffed on the ground out front. \\n\\nIn our attempt to get away from the drunk fight club members, my friend remembered that Revolver was opening Friday night and we decide to check it out.  First, I love the name.  I'm sorry, but that is a damn great name if you ask me.  Unfortunately, that is pretty much all I loved about it. \\n\\nThe line was ridiculous.  Fortunately, my friend always seems to have some sort of random connection and he got us in rather quickly.  Inside, the place looked exactly like Six, but with a different color scheme.  I never liked Six, so that was a huge disappointment.  It was also 90 degrees in there.  Everyone was sweaty, including myself. \\n\\nIt was extremely crowded at the bar and I received zero attention from the bartenders.  I finally decided to just leave because the last thing I wanted was to sip vodka in a sauna with a bunch of other sweaty people.  It was uncomfortable.

I can't stand when drunk people yell and get all dramatic in public (well, I love to watch, but I don't like being involved in it), so we ended up going our separate ways for the rest of the night.

We paid like $30/night, anymore than that would have awarded the place 0 stars. Plus, you get a free 24 hour buffet pass good at any of the Harris hotels. \\n\\nSecond tip: make sure your cab driver drops you off in FRONT of the hotel. Our cab driver dropped us off at the back entrance, not knowing any better we got out and then had to take two different elevators and walk a mile through the musty casino with our luggage to check in (which is located at the front of the hotel). Not fun. Boo, (curse you mean cabbie)! \\n\\nTo get to any of the rooms you have to walk through the smoke filled casino. Gross! \\n\\nMy BFF and I wanted to go to Vegas for our first vacation ever but were on a serious budget. Opting to maximize our spending power we went with the Imperial Palace. The rates are great and the nonsmoking rooms are truly smoke free. The hotel is centrally located on the strip, across from Cesar's Palace. \\n\\nThe actual room was kind of Motel 6ish. Not horrible but most definitely not the nicest room I have stayed in. It had those scratchy blankets and sheets, you know the ones. There were plenty of towels and good water pressure which is a definite plus. \\n\\nThe room had a tiny little \\\"patio\\\" but our glass door required the Jaws of Life to open, so we didn't go onto the patio much. There was a major wind storm so we didn't get to enjoy the pool (which was super far from our room) but looked decent enough. \\n\\nWe stayed in Tour 5 which meant we went to sleep (around 4am) and woke up (around noon) to blaring music. I am still not sure were the music was coming from, but if you live in a city with lots of street noise it won't bother you. \\n\\nOverall, the place is super dumpy compared to all the nice Vegas hotels but it gets the job done. Let's put it this way, we had a blast but made a pact not to return to Vegas until we could afford to stay at the Venetian or better. The biggest negative is having to walk to another hotel to shop, eat, and/or party. At the nicer hotels you can do this in your own hotel (and with guest perks) maximizing your stay.

Their philosophy totally represents how I try to care for my pets and family. They are located a perfect distance from me to just stop by and pick up what I need. The downside for me is that every time I go there the item I am looking for is no longer carried. Even if it is listed on their website as an item they own. They carried treats that worked perfectly for my dog, but then replaced them with something he refuses to eat. They also carried the dog food I feed my dog (even though it is still listed on their website). I also find them to be condescending when speaking to me about the products, as if I am not really interested in what is best for my dog. Or when I enter the shop, ask for a specific item I am looking for that they once carried, simply smile and say now we recommend \\\"insert other treat/food\\\" Not \\\"Sorry for the inconvenience, thank you for stopping in and we hope to see you again\\\"  They also always seem to have some sort of technical issue, cash register no working, online store down for maintenance. Many times I gave them a pass for being a new store but they have been open long enough that these things should be running smoothly. Sometimes it seems like the owners are more interested in delivering a philosophy than about running an efficient business.\n\nAnswer:",

Since there's no casino in here, it's nice to come back to a quiet hotel to pass out. Lobby is located on the 23rd floor and all the hotel rooms are 22nd floor and below (23 floor and up are private residences). The lobby area is pretty grand and it's definitely a really nice way to be welcomed into Vegas. \\n\\nService is good but there were a few details that were missed (like...forgetting to clean our room haha). I wouldn't say the service here is more spectacular than what you can get at other nice hotels but I'm just being snooty. Esp if you're going to pay a premium for staying here. \\n\\nThey do have a complimentary house car that will take you anywhere but check with downstairs since it never seems to be available. We only used it on our last day when we finally snagged a ride to the airport (actually, it wasn't available but we said we'd wait for it since we weren't in a rush). \\n\\nAlso key? There's a 24-hour CVS located right next door for all your late night munchies as well as a Starbucks right outside the hotel. Also, it's located right next to Aria & City Center so from a location stand point, it's pretty damn convenient.\n\nAnswer:",

The people working here were cool and let my friends and I sample as many flavors as we wanted (and there were a lot) before we made our decisions.  The gelato selections are great and varied with flavors like mascarpone, peanut butter, coconut, and some tropical mix of guava, mango, and papaya, I think.  I ended up getting the blueberry, and it was really good!  I can't say that Gelato 64 was AWESOME, but I can't say that it sucked, either.  It's just your standard gelato shop (with maybe more flavors) that does the job of satisfying your craving.  The prices are fine, parking is not a problem, and the people working there are your standard employees who are just working to work and not really cuz they have a passion for gelato.

Lucky for us it was 90 degrees out and it all dried fast! :-) \\n\\nAnd then the food. Ugh. Really disappointing, especially for the price. I ordered a strawberry lassie to drink with a Market BLT, based on Yelp recommendations.  The lassie was literally curdled and undrinkable, and the BLT had absolutely no bacon/pancetta on it. My husband ordered the Smoked Salmon Hash, which promised an impressive array of fresh ingredients and flavors, but in actuality looked and tasted like canned fish mixed with fried potato chunks.

He did not deliver our food and no one ever refilled our drinks. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there, so after 90 minutes of being basically ignored by the wait staff, we left with empty stomachs, out $50.00. Total waste, will probably never return.

And by last I mean both \\\"most recent\\\" and also \\\"final.\\\" I finally made it out and will never live in that sweaty armpit, dead-end town again. However, if you're one of the sun junkies who only needs to see that big ball glowing in the sky to be happy in life, and therefore like calling Phoenix home, I would recommend these apartments. There are two main buildings: townhouses on the west end and apartments on the east. The apartments have underground parking, which helps to not step into nauseating heat in your car, and the townhouses have garages. The complex has a lot of amenities, including courtyards, grills, a pool and jacuzzi, elevators, a gym, a pet run, a community room and a meeting room. I thought the people in the front office were a pleasure to deal with when I needed to discuss something. A huge plus was the noise: my downstairs neighbor had a party one night, which I could only hear because I went out onto my balcony, and my next door neighbor had his TV up loud, which I could only hear in the hall. I was amazed at how well the walls block out sound. It's in a convenient location to Downtown- Phoenix, -Tempe and -Scottsdale, and it's also near Sky Harbor and Loop 202. There's a light rail station that doesn't seem too far away until you actually walk it. Arizona loves that Soviet-style city planning, so if you wish to walk to the station you'll need to trek across great parking lots (i.e. open paved spaces) and a wide road and it will take about 20 minutes. Some downsides: unassigned parking is a bitch and fills up extremely fast, apartments on the southwest corner get way too much sun and will make your electric bill in the hot season (as opposed to Phoenix' only other, and much shorter season: warm) pretty high even if you try to conserve power.\n\nAnswer:",

Upon arrival I am greeted by a young lady who is on her laptop who does not bother to  look at me. Then an older female looked at me. I told her I was in to pick up an order. She asked what I ordered. As I list of my items: curry shrimp, beef and broccoli, and house fried rice, she rings up my bill and hands me my food. Overall, the food was good. The vegetables could be cooked a little longer. Service needs improvement. The room has some tables but people rarely dine there. There is a table in the front with healthcare items and supplements.

They had a special V-day Menu which we decided to order from. The first course was the Tuna Cocktail, this was slightly seared tuna with a spicy BBQ sauce and cucumbers. The Tuna Cocktail was good so when the second course came out, I had the Lobster Miso soup and the BF had the Hot and Sour Soup...it was a disappointment. The Lobster was so overcooked that it was rubbery and hard to even swallow, the Hot and Sour Soup was overly spicy and nothing special. The third course included the New Zealand Lamb Chops which had a Coffee Mole Sauce and Butternut Squash or the Aburi Yellowtail. The Mole Sauce overpowered the Lamb Chops, but the Yellowtail was surprisingly delish. For the main course we decided to order the Sushi for two. It came with Tuna Sashimi,  Toro, Salmon, Kobe Nigri Sushi, Tiger Roll, Crunchy Roll and Tropicana Roll.  All the rolls were half rolls (about 4 pieces each) and the nigri was nothing special. For dessert, they provided a chocolate type wafer dessert with a rasberry puree...I didn't care for it very much but the BF thought it was ok. Overall, we were a bit disappointed by the fact that this was supposed to be the only Master Sushi Chef in Las Vegas, but the quality of the food was mediocre.

Four stars?! All I wanted was non-AYCE sushi, rated decently,  and near the strip. Jesus H. Christ! It's a fail when you come into a restaurant starving and you leave with everyone in your party invoking the Lord's name with his middle initial.*\\n\\nThings started out okay with them seating us promptly. We drooled over the menu and ordered enough to feed every child in Botswana. It went downhill from there. The first piece of sushi, two pieces of uni, took almost an hour to get to our table. WE WERE WASTING VALUABLE GAMBLING TIME! Everyone at the craps table is depending on me to get back in the game.\\n\\nThe sushi man was a little stingy. It wasn't like I was ordering a 49 cent taco from Del Taco in South LA and then complaining to the cashier, and then to the manager that there wasn't enough meat in my sub-dollar taco, all the while getting approving \\\"um-huh\\\"s from my significant other standing behind me. You know? They could've been slightly more generous. \\n\\nWhat's funny is I think they were Thai. Thai reminds me of Thailand. Thailand reminds me of my vacation to Phuket. In Phuket, we journeyed to a steakhouse that was highly, I mean HIGHLY, rated by Tripadvisor. So I thinks, maybe we's getting a good deal on expensive steak. My partner orders a ribeye, bone-in, because that's how us gangsters roll. The waitress retorts, \\\"Just to let you know, it's a little chewy.\\\" My partner responds, \\\"What do you mean?\\\" Waitress says, \\\"Are you Malay?\\\" My partner, looking confused, says, \\\"No.\\\" Waitress replies, \\\"Have you had a steak before?\\\" HAHAHA. Okay, screw you guys. It was funny at the time.\\n\\nANYWAYZ. You're better off going to some of the better AYCE in Vegas and not stuffing your face. You'll pay the same amount, or less, and get better quality sushi.\\n\\n*In almost a decade spent in church, they never taught me what what Jesus's middle initial stood for, although the whispers say it may be Herbert, but it wasn't from me.\n\nAnswer:",

This was my third time to Brgr, and I had previously tried the Salmon Burger (just so-so) and the Tree Hugger (lentil & falafel - not too fulfilling). This time, however, I decided to take the plunge and try an actual BURGER.  So I went with the Shrooms burger, topped with forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie cheese and mustard aioli.  I ordered it medium-well, and it was prepared accordingly.\\n\\nFor me, a person who eats red meat only a couple times per year, the burger wasn't mindblowingly, extraordinarily outstanding.  It was tasty, but I wasn't rocked to my core. The mustard aioli was pretty yummy, though...unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the brie.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Double Yoi Burger, which came with pastrami, Swiss cheese, fried egg, cole slaw, and Thousand Island dressing. He moaned and raved his way through the thing - definitely sounds of pleasure and satisfaction. I was happy because it was his first time to Brgr, and he thoroughly enjoyed it.\\n\\nWe also shared an order of the fries (just with the parmesan and herbs), which were pretty standard (but nicely cooked), and a salty caramel milkshake (delish!). \\n\\nSo....from a culinary perspective, it was pretty good fare, though I have heard Burgatory blows it out of the water...\\n\\nAs for other factors, my friend and I had a short wait time, and our server was a very personable, patient, attentive 20-something woman who was very pleasant and helpful with our menu questions.  \\n\\nI would go back to Brgr - it's very convenient to my apartment, and I really want to try the Thai Pork & Shrimp Burger. :)\n\nAnswer:",

To me, giving someone a one star yelp review means that they have done something so egregious, that someone either did or could have gotten hurt as a result.  Oh wait...that's exactly what happened.  I recently flew into Phoenix with my brother, his husband and their 11 month old baby for a family wedding.  We rented an SUV with a car seat.  Initially, my brother asked if the car seat could be installed for them, as they were unfamililar with this model, and they were told company policy dictates that they could not install the seat.  Fine.  No big deal.  We install the seat and off we go to our hotel to rest up for the drive to Sedona the next day.  \\n\\nMy brother's husband had a nagging feeling about the seat that just wouldn't go away.  Finally, he drove to the local police station to have it inspected and we were informed that Hertz had neglected to include the base of the carseat and that it was in fact, unsafe to hold a child.  A quick call to Hertz later and I KID YOU NOT, we were informed that it was not negligence on their part, it was negligence on our part for driving off with the car seat that they had provided.  Are you counting?  We have two strikes so far.  Massive error that could have led to death of child (that's gotta count for at least 10 strikes though...right) and then complete failure to take responsibility or attempt to fix the problem.  The bro in law located a nearby Hertz location, and they said we could come and pick up a new seat.  They gave us a new seat, they sure did.  Once again, I kid you not, this one was missing clips.  \\n\\nWe made our way back to the original Hertz location at the airport.  The staff were rude, and spent a great deal of time rolling their eyes at us when we asked them for assistance putting a strange car seat into a car that we'd never seen before.  I understand they can't actually install it for liability purposes, but I can't believe that no one else has struggled to install an unfamiliar seat in an unfamiliar car.  Regardless, we never once received an apology, just continued rude behavior and eye rolls.  I travel often and have never encountered such poor customer service and lack of concern for safety at a car rental agency.  You can be sure that Hertz will never receive mine, my family's or any of my friends' business again.  You can bet that they will never receive the business of random people who I run into on the street.  This is how infuriated I am by their negligience and egregious mishandling of the whole situation.\n\nAnswer:",

It always looked pretty busy having walked by on other occasions.  Since we were planning on seeing a movie, it seemed convenient.\\n\\nWe should've followed our instincts and turned around when we saw the skankily dressed and over made up waitresses smoking outside the back door.\\n\\nWe were given the option of inside, bar, or outside. We opted for outside, and loved the cell call service for when the table was ready. There was no mention or indication of there being a band on the patio.   The hostess put us on the same side of a sticky picnic table. We had to move a couple of smokers who were sitting on top of the table before we could sit down. Note, WE had to,the hostess did not. At that point we realized a band was about to start playing.  Luckily we were able to get prices and place a drink order before the screeching started.\\n\\nThe drinks and our appetizer of chips and salsa came quickly, but our waters did not.  The music was so loud we couldn't even focus on reading the menu.  We asked to be moved inside, and the waitress obliged. The hostess (also the manager?) came out to move us, and made it clear in her facial expressions that we were severely inconveniencing her. She took us inside, and I caught her rolling her eyes at a waitress as she re-seated us. \\n\\nAbout 15 minutes later, we finally had a waitress approach us. During this time we had discussed dropping some money on the table and leaving, but we were too hungry and figured the experience could only get better from here.  We couldn't have been more wrong.\\n\\nFirst request, the water we hadn't gotten yet.  We immediately placed our order, and it came out about 10 minutes later.  It was dropped by a surly food runner with zero personality. Water?  Still missing.  I was stuck sipping my weak margarita and by boyfriend had nearly finished his beer.\\n\\nWhen we were halfway done with our lukewarm meals, the waitress came to check on us.  Was she carrying water?  Nope.  Finally she followed through on something and brought them.\\n\\nDuring this time we were subjected to the horrible music coming in from outside.  I'm fairly certain the band's singer was both tone deaf and unable to keep a beat.  I have heard better music at last call in a backwoods karaoke bar.\\n\\nThe baja sauce was disgusting. It's basically watered down mayo with a little hot sauce mixed in.  I should've taken to heart their sign that said \\\"if  the food doesn't meet your standards, lower your standards.\\\"\\n\\nWell, we finished our meal and waited for our check....for nearly 25 minutes. Between the bad music, bad food, and bad service, we nearly left without paying. Its clear nobody would've noticed.  Since we have manners, I got up and asked the 4 waitresses standing around at the entry for our check, since our's was MIA. They scurried off, and I assumed they were finding her.  After ANOTHER 10 minutes, she finally showed up with the check. \\n\\nAND she had the nerve to say \\\"see you guys next time!\\\" Never again.  Save your time, save your money, save your ear drums. Avoid San Felipe's Cantina.\n\nAnswer:",

I made reservations about two weeks in advance because I wanted to be sure I got the time slot I wanted. I made reservations for 7:30, we arrived there at 7:15. The hostess said we would be seated closer to 7:30 and that was fine. So we sat in the bar... and sat... and sat some more. It was almost 8 till we were finally seated. I saw people walk in get seated shortly after but not us and it was just a party of four. Finally get seated then ordered more drinks.. that took awhile... ordered an appetizer and that took awhile.... then the soup comes out AND that takes awhile... finally our entrees didn't come out till 9:14.. (I was checking my watch then) so we didn't leave the restaurant till 10... I thinking they were really lacking waiters. If the hostess seated us at the time I made reservations then it wouldn't have been so bad. But eating so late leaves awfuly bloated. Ok ok, now the good part. This is one of the best seafood restaurants I've been to in Arizona. It's fresh and delicious. I didn't have the salad bar, but it looked really really good. They have a good wine list and the apps are good too. We were way too stuffed to try the lava cake, but there's always next time. Just make reservations an hour earlier, ha!\n\nAnswer:",

The last time I came here for dinner, it was a pleasure. I associated Bluephies with fresh local greens, unique flavors that favored aioli and tapenade over mayo, and especially over-the-top breakfast yumminess.\\n\\n Alas, whatever's happened to dinner in the last year and a half, is totally depressing.  My fiance, my mother, and my two stepkids and I went the last night (8/11) we were in Madison before flying back here.  I ordered an apple chicken walnut salad sandwich, which used to be a pretty awesome blend of aioli and a locally baked croissant with mixed greens, with an interesting presentation.\\n\\nWhat I got, was something substandard to the airport food that we had at Denver International Airport, and more expensive to boot.  The chicken salad was totally overwhelmed with mayo, the lettuce flabby, and the croissant one of those commercial flabby affairs.  The kids menu dinner items were horrifying; the cheese quesadilla and pizza were microwaved and pretty darn tiny.  My mother's the most forgiving person when it comes to restaurants, but her salmon wasn't good either.  My fiance's meal was totally over-mayoed as well. \\n\\nThe waitress staff were good, and one waitress who had been there for 2 1/2 years said that it wasn't what it used to be.  And when we complained about the quality of the food, they took off one plate from the price.  I know times are tough, but even out here people have the sense that if you want people to try to get you to ever come back, you should comp the whole meal, or at least offer a free dinner the next time around.\\n\\nI've used Yelp a bunch of times to check out restaurants ahead of time, but this meal inspired me to actually start up my own account.\n\nAnswer:",

I had a toasted spinach bagel with egg and cheese-yummy. I was sitting on the front patio when I noticed a bird struggling in a high branch of the palo verde tree nearest the building. The little sparrow had it's foot caught on the branch and was hanging upside down. It would flutter it's wings valiantly every few minutes trying to right itself, then hang helpless again. I wanted to help, but it was so high up I knew I couldn't climb all the way up. One of the staff members came out to see if everyone was happy so I pointed out the little bird and asked her if they had a long pole of some kind. She went back inside and came out with a ladder and a broom. So she set up the ladder and I was preparing to climb up with the broom stick to see if I could help free the bird.  Meanwhile everyone on the patio and passing by had stopped to see what was happening. I was about to climb up when another staff member came out to assess the situation. He quickly came up with a better solution and disappeared inside. Shortly he returned with an extendable pole that would easily reach the sparrow. After gently trying to nudge the bird free we all realized the entaglement was more serious. This kind man climbed the tree and with the help of another volunteer on the ground pulled the branch close enough to reach. He then gently captured the bird and brought it down. Both of its feet were badly tangled with some sortof stringy moss. The bird's thrashing had twisted ithe string so badly he would surely have died before breaking free. Everyone helped to untangle his feet and then we set the tiny sparrow free.

Really- jokes, laughs, great conversation, and quality hair cutting filled the spacious shop.  I felt like I stepped back in time when I saw the card table with dominoes at the comfy waiting area.  Folks were there to simply visit, which I loved-lets you know that this business treats every customer like a member of the \\\"circle\\\"\\n\\nPayed a visit to Vegas and needed to cut my locks off, found Blade Masters on a google search and dropped in.  Was attended to instantly, enjoyed the music and surrounding conversations so much I honestly didn't want to leave so soon.  Freaked out a little when baby boy whipped out the shaving blade-never had my edges cleaned up with shaving cream and a blade, @that point I decided I would be back to Blade Masters anytime I was in Las Vegas whether I need a hair cut or eyebrow arch...yes, they do eye brows!\n\nAnswer:",

I know this is super wasteful of food, but I wanted to sample it all T_T. There were sooooooooooo much, some good and some not so good. The food that I liked was the fried chicken and the BBQ chicken. I liked the corn, green beans and mashed potatoes. Got myself 2nd helpings of those\\n-The salad bar was ok, though it looked slightly dirty so I avoided that. I will be going to Souplantation for my salad needs. Though, the watermelon was very sweet, so I gobbled those up rather quickly. \\n-Service was also very good. They cleared our plates rather quickly and brought us waters!\\n-Dessert bar is heaven!!!

I also did dip ONE strawberry in the chocolate foundation, but the strawberries were rotten so I didn't bother after the first one. : (\\n-There are 4 ice cream flavors: mint, vanilla, rainbow sherbet and cookies and cream. I tried everything but vanilla. The rainbow sherbet tastes watered-down. I would avoid. The other flavors are ok. \\n-Cotton candy is a nice touch. I saw some guy with 3. O_O. \\n\\n\\nCons:\\n-Please please please AVOID the Chinese section at all costs. It was horrid. I'm ok with Panda quality food, but the food here is below Panda level. I tried some orange chicken and it tasted bitter and garlic-y. The eggrolls were stale and filled with who-knows-what. \\n-There was also this Pork chop that was grilled, and it was very dry and chewy. I did not bother to finish it. \\n-The chicken soup was not comparable to Souplantation's chicken soup. It was very salty and cloudy. Also, hardly no chicken. Avoid the soup. \\n\\n\\nOverall, I decided it was an OK restaurant. I overstuffed myself trying all the foods. It's now almost 8pm and I'm still full : (. Also, the food is full of fat and oil. : ( : ( I don't think I would come back to eat lunch again. Nothing against the restaurant or food, it's just not my style, as I try to eat more healthy. \\n\\nHowever, the weekend breakfast is something I'd want to try..... so we'll see if I wake up early enough to drive to RH to stand in line.\n\nAnswer:",

My room was the basic, low budget one, and I can't believe they sell this thing at around $200 a night. The TV isn't even a flatscreen one- I could get a cheap room with a better TV at Excalibur. The only thing good about that room was the bed that had lots of soft pillows on it.\\n\\nThe casino floor isn't very big. I think most of the Palms' main building is for their clubs, some of which happen to be inconveniently near the hotel room elevators, making it difficult to get to your room since you have to squeeze by nasty, Ed Hardy wearing douchebags and drunk girls wearing dresses that would've fit them 20lbs ago. It seems like this hotel was made for just the \\\"bros\\\" because every time I walked into the elevator, what would come out was some ugly sparkly-shirt wearing, uber tanned, spikey haired guy. Yuck. Oh and they have AXE deodorant spray in the rooms too. \\n\\nFood selection was lame, and the waiters at the 24/7 Cafe need to be more attentive. I left after waiting for over 20 minutes to be served. \\n\\nThe only good thing I have to say about this place is that most of the staff is really nice. The reception and concierge desk were helpful, especially with letting me check in to my room at 9:30 AM instead of waiting till 4 PM.

I didn't know what proper etiquette is when dropping into someone else's game, so we waited for the other kids' game to be over then came over and asked, \\\"Can we play?\\\" The kids obliged. \\n\\nDodgeball was fun. They have all these underinflated volleyballs to throw around. If you get tagged, you're out. There is no jail. You just have to wait on the side til the game is over. \\n\\nAt first I didn't want to play with strangers because if I get tagged in the head, I' want it to be from a friend.

The hotel lets customers know by the hour.. So despite my room may be ready at 4:10... I have to wait until 5:00 to be informed that it's ready. Not good! I will be late to my event..

What looked great on the pan turned out to be a runny mess. The cheese they are using is runny and I don't mean soft and gooey, I mean running off the pizza and of the pan when you separate the pieces.

I would not recommend Mix for New Years Eve.  Any other night I would say it is a great choice.\\n\\nFirst the good.  The 5 course tasting meal was phenomenal.  We didn't just like all the courses, we loved them, and all were simply fantastic.  The opening veggie martin with truffle topping was one of the best appetizers I have tasted.  The wine pairing will also very nice, and our waiter was fantastic during the whole meal service.  It was also a very fun and festive atmosphere.\\n\\nNow for the bad.  The whole reason we chose Mix, and paid the higher price, was to see the fireworks from their vantage point.  The problem was, we had no view at all.  The only people that had a view were the few tables that opted for outside seating.  The restaurants does NOT overlook the strip, and thus if you pressed your face to the window on one side, you could barely see two of the hotel fireworks.  The view is from the Mix Lounge, however that was closed, and restaurant patrons could not enter.  The other disappointing fact, was our waiter, who was so friendly and attentive, and throughout the whole meal, assured us just before the fireworks he would show us the good spot to stand.  The only problem was, after 11:30, he disappeared, and never reappeared.  There was no good spot, and this seemed in retrospect to have been just a con to get an increased tip.\\n\\nMix is a fabulous restaurant, and I would highly recommend it, but avoid it in New Year's Eve.  It is a waste of time.\n\nAnswer:",

I love pizza, that and a beer is one of my favorite meals. I called in an order for pick up and it was ready in the time they gave me, I think 25 minutes.\\n\\nThe pizza is overall.... Ok? I ordered pepperoni and extra cheese and the amount of cheese seemed a little less than \\\"extra.\\\" The pepperoni and everything tasted pretty good. I especially like the crust, it's on the thinner side but not too thin and was really tasty. Although I know pizza isn't an especially healthy choice, this one was rather greasy, which was a big turn off to my boyfriend. Also it really falls apart the further into the slice I got, eventually completely coming apart from the fat crust at the end. Between the grease and fall-apart quality this makes for a messy pizza experience.\\n\\nOverall I have mixed feelings. It definitely wasn't bad pizza but not great either.

Best places back home to buy this kind of thing are on 185th Street, the ethnic \\\"hood.\\\"   Moving to Phoenix meant lots of sunshine, no snow and no sausage like I was used to.  The closest I could find to home was Stanley's on Bell Road.  They have a wonderful selection and the girls smile every time I go in and ask, \\\"Now how do you pronounce that?\\\"  My favorite is the rice sausage that's made with liver.  It is in a ring and bakes up great in the oven!  Short of making a trip back to Cleveland & 185th Street or the West Side Market, this is GOOD STUFF!   Do I shop there all the time?  Nope, but it's definitely the place to go to stock up for ethnic holiday types of meals, especially at Easter and Christmas time.  \\n\\nI stopped at Shreiner's last week on my way home from work and was a little dissappointed.  They were out of a lot of stuff, didn't even seem familiar with my favorites, but the young girl working there was very nice.  She told me they don't make the type of sausage I was looking for, but suggested I try some Brats.   Not exactly what I wanted, but I decided to try some.

We are in Nevada if I spend money why not give a nice size cup of water its a desert out their. They seem to look down on you because you don't want a soda. But I just spent 30 bucks ugh!

So I bought the pudding. However when I got home I could not believe my eyes. The pudding was box made. I Deceive you not people. \\nSo I jumped back into my SUV and ran back across town to gritz.

The waiter acted like we were bothering him, and walked away before we even finished talking.  We waited 15 minutes for our table, which I wouldn't have minded, but the hostess said they had a table almost ready for us when we walked in.  It took forever to get our bill (hand scratched on a notepad), and we were overcharged for our drinks.  Happy hour prices are awesome and I really do like the food, but because of the poor/lazy/rude attitudes of the wait staff I will not be coming back.

We sat on stools at the bar with our backs to the front entrance with a grand view of the culinary drama and genius at play. Service was impeccable, and the timing of our dishes was perfectly executed. The kitchen ran like a well oiled machine. A delightfully wicked glee ran through me when I witnessed the chef sample and sneer before tossing some prepped food that failed to meet his standard into the trash, followed by a fleeting sadness for the waste. \\n\\nStarted off with some bubblies since it was a special occasion. Could not resist the bread basket, especially that fluffy cheese croissant. The dining experience was a sublime rollercoaster from start to finish; one I would gladly stand in line for immediately after!\\n\\nL'Amuse Bouche was a shotglass of airy cheesy foam atop a delectable morsel of foie gras parfait with port wine reduction. The parmesan emulsion lightened and enhanced the richness of the foie gras underneath, and really got my juices flowing! \\n\\nL'Hamachi was not a pasta ravioli as I had imagined from the description in the Seasonal Discovery Menu, but rather two generous slivers of raw hamachi wrapped around sea urchin in lemon vinaigrette topped with caviar. This dish married all of my favorite things into two bites and took my tongue to another dimension which did not bode well for the next two dishes.\\n\\nLe Macaroni - macaroni in a comte gratin, mushroom and smoked bacon was a comforting blend of soft textures and hearty flavors, but my palate was still reeling from the yellowtail caviar uni so it tasted great but not as intense.\\n\\nLe Crabe Royal - king crab curried served over a couscous of broccolini and fresh herbs - I prefer my seafood unadulterated, so the dish lacked punch. This was my least favorite dish.\\n\\nLe Foie Gras de Canard - seared foie gras with sweet and sour grapes and black pepper brought my tastebuds back to the incline. The acid grapes and bite from the pepper contrasted and complimented the seared foie gras. It's a blessing FG is banned in California otherwise I would be eating this every freaking day.\\n\\nLe Matsutake - this rare and expensive mushroom bouillion with gingered leeks, quail egg was presented in a humble and delicate bowl and tasted as delicate and pure as it looked.\\n\\nLe Saint Pierre - a pleasantly firm John Dory over tender artichoke hearts served \\\"en barigoule\\\" tasted immaculately pristine, delicate and satisfying in the most comforting way. And just when I thought I was full my lips tasted\\n\\nLa Caille - caramelized free range quail stuffed with foie gras, served with the fluffiest buttery mashed potatoes EVER. The nuggets of foie gras with the roast quail was exquisite and took me over the edge so that I could not share  \\n\\nLa Hampe - but the BF assured me that the french style hanger steak with roasted shallot and shishito pepper was properly executed. I for one was done. DUN. until I saw dessert and honestly can say that while I cannot recall the flavors of \\n\\nLe Frasier - strawberry cream, chiffon biscuit and strawberry sorbet \\n\\nLe Dulce revived me - chocolat fondant with dulce cream and cherry sherbet was delightfully gorgeous and easy on the eyes and tongue.

You can see the aforementioned sexy XXX anywhere in Vegas. My advice to the consumer- decide what you want if it's raunch go elsewhere, if it's Cirque try O.

UN-Fortunately... the food isn't any good and the drinks are mediocre.  Great choice of tequilas and scotch which was cool. You're best off getting chips and salsa and a water, and thats about it.   This is Mexican food for the white man!!  It's not authentic, or traditional, but it is a great place to take a date b/c the decor is amazing.  Too bad the food isn't as good as the venue!  $8 for a tecate and $14 for an average margarita.  If you want great Mexican food with great drinks VISIT \\\"SEGUNDO\\\" by the fashion show mall/RA sushi.  If you don't care about good food but want a nice atmosphere, but all means visit!\n\nAnswer:",

What ever it was, the \\\"huge sandwiches\\\" that many have mentioned, including my friend Austin who was with me yesterday, have been replaced by huge slices of bread.\\n\\nThick slices of bread are perfect for french toast, but shouldn't be anywhere near a sandwich. Maybe if what was in between the slices was served in an equally generous portion, this would be okay, but as it was served to me, the massive slices of bread only emphasized the meager portions of meat and toppings. This was disappointing to say the least.\\n\\nThe quality of the soup and half sandwich I ordered was decent. The soup definitely better than the sandwich, but also in a smaller portion than the reputation of this place suggested.\\n\\nIt's a cool atmosphere with a decent selection at the bar. The Pumpkin Porter from Four Peaks was especially good.\\n\\nThe service left much to be desired. Our meals were brought to us by a different server than took our order and was visibly annoyed that we were in the middle of a conversation when she showed up to give us our food. How dare I finish the sentence I was wrapping up while she waited roughly 5 seconds with our food. But hey, that's how I roll.\\n\\nOur experience at Bison's was  2.5 stars. I'll give them the extra .5 for offering Four Peaks seasonal. Other than that, it's no the kind of place I see myself craving.\n\nAnswer:",

We found some yummmmmmmmmy jumbo shrimp salad and it was a huge portion for the price and got some chicken salad that was just as good.  I bought some fresh baked large chocolate chip cookies (similar to what you find at albertsons) but these were 10x better. They are GREAT.  Their fresh made sushi dept had better portions and better prices then the grocery store AND better quality.  They weren't as good as being at an actual sushi bar of course but definitely better then the typical grocery store variety.   We also finished up with a hot dog and a drink for $1.50 and it was HOT and very yummmy.\\n\\nThis place was absolutely packed both in the parking lot and inside, and I could totally see why.  I will definitely go back again for a variety of items.\\n\\nOh btw.... Checking out was FAST too. It definitely wasn't like a busy Wal-mart where only a few lanes were open.  They had every lane open and people boxing your stuff up and you were in and out of that checkout line in just a few quick minutes.  \\n\\nThe only thing I think they could improve on is extend their hours a little later into the evening.

I moved into the Cheery Lynn Historic neighborhood about three years ago and have watched several places fail. I've hoped somebody would buy this cute little place and make it into something great. \\n\\nSo, my husband, son and I went yesterday with high hopes and hungry bellies. We've been looking forward to trying it since we got a menu on the door the other day.\\n\\nI hope as they move into their new space, they update the decor and get rid of some of the previous owners' decor. Such a big part of going out to eat, is the ambiance. The building is so cute and there's so much potential for it, but what the original Two Hippies owner did was just plain awful.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, I am unfortunately sad to report that it was just not that good. My first \\\"beef\\\" is the beef. I originally posted that I had thought they used frozen patties, but received the nicest reply stating that they do get their meat locally and it is never frozen. Perhaps we just came on a bad day. I ordered the Loco Moco and I had to cut my hamburger patty with a knife and fork. I was also excited to try the homemade macaroni salad, but again... not so good. It was more of a mayonnaise-macaroni soup. Way to runny for my taste. But that's just me. My husband got a burger and it was okay. The best thing we got was my son's hot dog. It was just a plain hot dog with ketchup but it was pretty tasty. I'm thinking that when I go back (and I definitely will so I can give them another chance and I can support my neighborhood joint), I'm going to get one of those hot dogs. They have all sorts of exciting options for hot dogs including homemade chili (my favorite).\\n\\nThey do have really delicious strawberry lemonade and tropical iced tea. \\n\\nI feel bad writing anything bad because I'd really like to see the new owners succeed.

So I thought I could get a healthy meal, but I was wrong...\\n\\nI talked to the worker at the front for 5 min, and asked her if there is a healthy (no oily/greasy) style way of making the dish. Unfortunately, we established that there was no way to do this.  Why have the brown rice option if you can't order the dish itself in a healthy way?   \\n\\nI ordered the Pei Wei style chicken, and I waited for the food to come. 15 min later I finally got it. Keep in mind there was no one behind in line, and one person ordering from the \\\"take out\\\" line. I watched  the whole process go down. The main chef put my plate down on the counter in the kitchen, and the \\\"salad chef\\\" was supposed to garnish it with a simple rosemary/parsley addition. That hand off took an extra 7 minutes.... It seemed to me that there was arguing,  and disorderly production behind the counter.\\n\\nMy other complaint would be that the dinner portion which not that large is kinda of pricey.  The plate looks huge when it comes out of the kitchen, but  the Plate comes with 75% rice, and 25% meat so don't be fooled.   Why would you want to eat that kind of protein/carb ratio?  \\n\\nI cannot order the lunch plate because it would not come with enough meat.\n\nAnswer:",

Word to the wise: TAO = a place where the customer is always wrong.\\n\\nHere's the skinny: we dined 11 deep Saturday evening while in town celebrating my 32nd birthday. It's Memorial Day weekend and expected to be a madhouse in Vegas, so I made every precaution to secure reservations, be on time for said reservations and ensure my entire party was on time with me. I may not be Kim Kardashian, but perhaps the manager failed to note that my reservation was made by someone who works directly with them and asked for my party to be taken care of. I'm also assuming they didn't know that I am a celebrity publicist in LA and have sent numerous clients to spend thousands of dollars at their establishment. Maybe if this was noted my party would have received better service. \\n\\nFood: my boyfriend and I split the chicken dumplings, the spicy yellowtail sushi roll and the chicken pad thai. More than enough food! The pad thai seemed to be in a never-ending bowl! It alone would have fed the 2 of us easily. The dumplings were the best choice out of our order. Fresh, steamed and flavorful. I only wish there were more in an order! The roll was good, but nothing special. My friend had the BBQ pork and it was phenomenal. I'd look into that if BBQ meats are your thing. The pad thai was pretty standard. It was also good but nothing to write home about. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the overall good experience. The crowning glory was the giant fortune cookie that was sent out for my birthday (it is filled with both vanilla and chocolate cream - oh hey ying yang!) - which was the only good move by the restaurant the entire meal.\\n\\nThe service: this is where things get rough. We sat down for our 8:30pm reservation around 8:45pm. We didn't mind the 15 minute wait. We're a large party and it's Saturday night - reservations can take some time. I get it. We sat down and didn't see a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. When she finally came by the table she took our drink order and bounced for another 20 minutes or so. My friend asked for an iced tea that 40 minutes later had never made it's way to the table. When we asked about it, the waitress took another 15 minutes to bring it claiming that they had to \\\"brew a new pot\\\". Ok. Then when we were an hour and a half into our dinner order waiting for more beverages the waitress was M.I.A. We finally called over the manager and asked if we could please get some drinks (one of which had already been ordered and never brought to the table). His response was \\\"what? Are you trying to get something free out of this?\\\". I'm sorry? No. We are trying to get our drinks and spend more money in your establishment. Wow. The next epic failure of this restaurant/nightclub comes from the security guard/staff. My boyfriend got up from the table to take a work related call. It was noisy inside so he stepped outside to take it. When he came back in a security guard grabbed him by his shirt and said \\\"where do you think you're going?! Get in line!\\\" To which my boyfriend responded - \\\"I've been sitting with a table of 11 for nearly 2 hours. I just stepped outside to take a call.\\\" The guard then responded \\\"yeah right\\\" and grabbed him by his shirt collar. When he turned around to radio someone my boyfriend just yanked himself free and walked inside. The final straw was when the waitress asked if we'd like to divide the tab. We said yes and tried to be fair by making a few groups so as not to create 11 separate checks for her. Tik-tok - 1 hour later (literally) she plopped down the checks with a look of irritation and left. \\n\\nTotal time in restaurant (due to slow service) - 3.5 hours!! It was nearly midnight when we finally left!\\n\\nThe club was hopping but we were not interested in that. We just wanted a nice dinner in what seemed to be only a mildly busy restaurant. A party of 11 would have left a much bigger tip had the service been respectable. I get that everyone wants to dine here, but that doesn't mean you have to stop creating a great customer experience for those choosing your restaurant. There are MANY other options.\n\nAnswer:",

His status allowed us to bypass to the front of the line. Entering close to 10PM, we were told in line that dinner service would 10:20PM, however we word be able to stay until 11PM. The food was decent, much better then the Paris buffet that we tried in a past year. I enjoyed the wide variety of foods that they offered. The crab legs seemed popular but I chose not to try it. I did not care for their Kobe beef (most certainly false advertising) as it was tough and chewy. I would also pass on the ham which was dry and salty. However, the assortment of Asian inspired and Italian pasta dishes were savory, with the right amount of oily and creaminess respectively. I also enjoyed their peppermint cheesecake for dessert but was sad they already turned off their ice cream maker at that time.

Do note, though, that we live off of 19th Ave south of Dobbins (about 1 mile south of the southernmost boundary of the delivery zone) and they said that they would deliver to us without a problem, so definitely still try if you're just outside of the zone. \\n-There is a $12 pre-tax minimum for delivery \\n-Food is decent quality for the price and not as greasy as one would expect\\n-Paper menus have some decent coupons on them. Best one gives you 10 free crab puffs or 3 free egg rolls with purchase of $15 or more\\n-Lunch specials are ridiculously cheap (from $3.50 - $4.50 for entree and rice; $4.15 to $4.88 for entree, rice, egg roll, and crab puff) and are served until 3:30 pm\\n\\nDefinitely not worth driving to if you don't live in South Phoenix.

I'm a Food Network fan, so I had to check this place out when I saw it featured one evening on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  Don't let the location frighten you, as your GPS will guide you into a combination residential/commercial/farming/ranching part of Las Vegas not far from the strip.  My wife and I, along with our two teenagers were blown away by the quantity AND quality of the food!  Everything is homemade here.  The mac n' cheese is unbelievably delicious! Not-to-mention the brisket, ribs, chicken, pulled pork, green beans, baked beans, macaroni salad...and cobbler for dessert.  They make their own BBQ sauce used for dipping (both regular and hot).  We tried it all, and will definitely be back!  The eating area is all outside on picnic tables.  The owner made his way around the tables to greet everyone.  We went during a week night (he mentioned Fridays and Saturdays are the most crowded).  This place is an outstanding value for BBQ.  It will definitely be our first eating stop when we return to Vegas!\n\nAnswer:",

I washed them on cold, gentle cycle, inside out (our washer is the kind without an agitator) and didn't even dry them. I have several pairs of Sanctuary pants that are not maternity and worn them for years without issue.

Which is why I had to book my guy four separate flights to get to and from a work conference in Orlando: one from LAS to DFW, another from DFW to Orlando, then the same in reverse to return, in order to get the best final price.\\n\\nFirst flight was delayed and then cancelled. No contact was made to alert me of this prior to arriving at the airport. Every other airline I've flown has texted and/or called me in a timely manner. Had to make two trips in one hour to our lovely airport to retrieve my guy. Staff had absolutely no ability to reschedule anything or come up with any possible solutions. This airline only seems to have evening/red-eye flights, so next available flight was 24 hours away, which didn't work for the conference we were travelling for in the first place.\\n\\nSince rescheduling with the same airline was not an option, had to shell out last-minute ticket prices for American Airlines- twice the price. Spirit has very strict policies/rules about when/how to request refunds, and I'm happy someone informed me that they are only able to issue one refund per trip per person. In other words, if your first flight has an issue, don't do anything about it until you have thoroughly completed your travel with Spirit. Because if you have additional issues getting home, they won't be able to do anything. Which makes no sense at all.\\n\\nReturn flight was also delayed, but luckily not cancelled. Which isn't to say it's wasn't without irritation. What was supposed to be a 11PM arrival barely made it around 1:30AM. Luckily I didn't have work in the morning.\\n\\nOverall flight experience is miserable. Tiny-ass seats, very strict luggage requirements, steep fees for every little thing, not even water is free of charge in the air. Basically, you can only travel with a lunchbox unless you want to shell out $40-50, because they will literally charge you $100 at the gate to CARRY ON a bag. Even if it's a duffel bag. Because lord knows if you ain't got no leg room, your weekend bag isn't likely to fit under the seat in front of you, either.\\n\\n**IF YOU ARE CARRYING ON LUGGAGE, take your bag to the airport and make sure it fits in their little container. Otherwise, the fees you pay will eliminate any savings you get on the ticket price. Consider yourself warned!**\\n\\nI love saving money, but I wont be doing this again.\n\nAnswer:",

Urban Yoga is an excellent find here in Central Phoenix.  I used to drive all the way to Scottsdale and Paradise Valley for my yoga classes. I loved the studio and teachers but was never thrilled about the drive. When my favorite yogini left the state of AZ, I was left to find a new place to train my mind, body , and spirit. I tried two other studios in close proximity to where I live. I never felt the comfort, challenge, or connection I had before. I found Urban Yoga and it is exactly what I am looking for. I looked at the studios website URBANYOGAPHX.COM before going over for a class. It has detailed descriptions of all of the classes and teachers.It tells you all about the studio and what it has to offer. As soon as I walked in to Urban Yoga, I felt comfortable. I was greeted by a friendly girl at the front desk. She was very engaging and showed me around the studio before the start of class. The over all vibe at the studio just feels comfortable.  Its esthetically pleasing and kept clean. The class was excellent. Lindsey was the teacher and she had a great energy and knowledge of yoga. I like that the class is one hour. It is just the right amount of time. I also had a class with Megan and it was very challenging. I loved it. I enjoy the variety of teachers and styles that Urban Yoga offers. I am full of gratitude to have found Urban Yoga. NAMASTE.\n\nAnswer:",

Sometimes the portions are a bit small, but the taste is always there.  Same thing goes for their coffee, too, always fantastic and a great way to wake up... a little caffeine buzz balanced out with a breakfast bagel.  MMMM!  \\n\\nTheir macaroons are really fucking good, too.  I like the tiny ones.  I like miniature things, I dunno.  I like tiny chickens.  I like itty-bitty little cars.  If I could get away with it, I would shrink myself to be about 8 inches tall... but I read a Bukoswki story that made me change my mind.\\n\\nI don't come here as much as I'd like to because the place is always so over-crowded it's a pain in the ass.  That means they're doing well and I'm glad that they are, but sometimes I like to eat in peace.  Essence is always humming with thirty different conversations going on and clanking plates and clinking dishes.  It's not a very comfy place if you've been out drinking the night before.\\n\\nAs I said before, depending on what you order, the portions can be a bit small.  I'm fine with that, I think Americans, as a general rule, eat way more than they should and we've been spoiled by such large portions.  So I agree with the portion-sizes here, absolutely, but sometimes it can be a bit expensive if you want a breakfast sandwich.  It's a bit silly to spend close to $10 and get like this small-sized little guy with a single strip of ham.  The food always tastes really good, but it's still overpriced.\\n\\nThere's a lot to like and I'm glad that they're around and functioning and doing very well for themselves.

With all of the identity theft going on I don't like having unnecessary copies of my driver's license floating around and I did not allow this.\\n\\nChristopher acknowledged that it was my money but said that they would not give me it back unless they photocopied my driver's license, which I would not allow him to do.  In my book, this is theft, plain and simple.  Interestingly, they then gave me my jacket back--making it difficult to argue that they had any doubt that they money and jacket belonged to me.  I pointed out that the same dealers were in the poker room and even several of the same players were still playing at the table--all of whom could identify me. They also have numerous cameras so they were literally a dozen ways they could have verified my identity, if needed, though Christopher never disputed that it was my money.

There was no one ahead of us in line, one family seated and eating, and yet it took 10-15 minutes for two small meals.  This was due to the chicken needing to be cooked fresh, but the fries were ready and cooked.\\n\\nThe rip'n' chicken combo for $4.99 was an okay deal.  It's a chicken breast basically cut into chicken fingers, breaded, and fried, so it looks like a hand (easy for children and simple to eat). It also includes a medium soft drink and cajun fries (the only kind of fries).\\n\\nThe chicken was fresh and juicy.  The breading is chewy and doesn't have much flavour.  The chicken and breading was noticeably less salty and less greasy than KFC.\\n\\nThe fries were sitting under the heat lamp and were stale. They tasted freezer burnt and just didn't taste like they were fresh or quality potatoes.  I would suggest trying another side, like the cajun rice or mac 'n' cheese.\\n\\nTheir dipping sauces are good: they have a blackened ranch sauce and a cajun mustard sauce, which has horseradish. They were a spicy complement to the chicken fingers.\\n\\nThis location charges 90 cents for pop refills. I'm not sure if this is location specific or  Popeyes' policy, but they're clearly out of sync with restaurants like McDonald's or KFC offering free refills.\\n\\nIn all, this is a welcome contrast to KFC: different, delicious, but lacking some of the customer service traits to drive customers into the restaurant.\n\nAnswer:",

My friend was visiting and her flight was at 6am so she wanted to eat early. We had a 5PM reservation and they said they don't hold reservations. I arrived at 4:40 and there were 4 hostesses gabbing. I walked up to check in and they told me I had to get in line to check in?? I said can't I just check in and wait at the bar. NOPE. They don't open the doors until 5. Seems to me I'd open at 4 and get some cocktail revenue. Plus, wouldn't it be just as easy and more polite to just check me in? But hey, what do I know. They were pretty snooty and I don't know why. Bet they don't make enough to eat there. So I stand in line like an asshole and wait. Then at 5 she yells out who has a reservation. \\n\\nWe are seated quickly and the waiter brings an iPad with the specialty drinks. There are no prices on the drink menu. The tables are on top of each other NYC style. That would have been OK, if they didn't squeeze 5 people in a 4 top right next to me. The guy was huge and I had to keep myself tucked in like the middle seat on a plane. Luckily they were really nice and I had fun talking to them. \\n\\nFood-\\nBrown butter tortellini $20  it was ok\\nBeef Wellington $54 which is the signature dish. You can only get it rare, but it is baked so it isn't bloody for us medium eaters. The Wellington itself was pretty good. I hated the sauce it was floating in. It tasted like something from NASA. The root vegetables were fantastic! All 2 bites of them. \\nCreamed spinach $12 was pretty yummy. \\nFilet $78 She ordered it medium and I swear it was going to moo. She sent it back and it returned exactly the same. She ended up not eating it and taking it to go\\nSticky toffee pudding $14 for dessert. Good. \\nFrench press coffee $12 that came with chocolate spoons That was the highlight of the meal. A must have. \\nOne Beaujoulais wine $12\\nOne antioxidant cocktail $14\\n\\nPricewise, ridic. It was $210, plus tip. To be squished in, not able to breathe, rude hostesses, and pretentious and annoying assistant waiters. Our waiter was pretty nice and efficient.  So to sum up this rant. Don't bother. I'd way prefer STK, Craft, Nine, Gallaghers, even Outback, actually almost anywhere but here. Gordon needs to show up here and do some swearing. Def a tourist trap.

The steak was no better than what you would receive at Denny's at 2 AM in the morning.  This place is way over priced and the food flat out sucks.  Todd English needs to re-evaluate the direction of Olives.  I felt this way the first time around and I didn't say anything, but after my second visit to the restaurant I couldn't let my disappointment in the cuisine slide.  The public needs to know that this restaurant is a rip off.   If you want good food go to BOAS or the Stratosphere.\n\nAnswer:",

Sometimes I wonder if relatives give these places the 4-5 star reviews. \\nI will say the place was clean and tidy and the counter girl was pleasant. I don't like cafeteria style restaurants, especially at $12.00 a plate. Only thing good about an order yourself place is I don't tip. \\nI ordered the BBQ pork and it was bbq'd right to the skewer so I had to eat it with my hands. It was over cooked, rubbery and way to thin. However, it did have a good flavor. The macaroni salad was very good and they were happy to replace the rice with a green salad at no extra cost.  The short ribs were very tough and cut thin, again the flavor was good. The coconut shrimp tasted like it was just ordinary frozen restaurant fare, nothing special. I really wanted to like this place as we need more family run places and not chain eateries. We were there from 5:30 to 6:30 and we were the only ones in the place the whole time. Too bad. Oh yeah, it took a long time to get our food being we were the only patrons . I may try it again and order the chicken.\n\nAnswer:",

Be prepared to be overwhelmed when you walk in the door, I bet there are no less than 1,000+ bicycles wedged in this space on the floor and hanging from the ceiling.  If you walk in with no criteria your brain can easily explode, but for me I was looking for a Cannondale pre-2009 Made in the USA frame that was under $1,000.  We found three, pulled them out, and took a little test ride.  Settled in on one that I liked and bit the bullet.  The downside of this place is that they are overpriced (as other reviewers noted), but you do get a free tune-up (worth about $100) that you can use whenever you'd like, a four month warranty,  and you know that the bike has been checked over and \\\"loved\\\" before you take it home.  Bottom line is that I'm impatient so I didn't want to sit and watch Craigslist for a better deal, so Budget was the next best option.

Why else would a some bagel shops charge $1.50 for the bagel with spread, while the others go for $2.00 plus?  And still others charge $4.00 for a bagel with egg and cheese, while other do it for $2.00?\\n\\nBrueggers, as a chain, was blessed with the breakfast sandwich advantage, and they do it well.  Not only can you get an egg o'bagel for under $3.00, but you can also add spinach, mushrooms, and other fresh veggies to it for just a few shekels more.  This is not possible at your other corporate bagel stops.  If a bagel with a spread won't do, Bruegger's is a better bet.  \\n\\nAdd to that the fact that this store is just a doorway away from a Carribou's Coffee and this is breakfast made in heaven.  Sadly, though, I am not alone in this assessment as both sides can be quite full on weekend mornings.  This even holds true for the outside patio tables during warmer weather, where people watching is at a premium.  Sadly this can making parking a challenge too, though CMC's lot next door has helped out.\\n\\nThe other challenge is, as mentioned by others, cleanliness of the place.  Staff are apparently too busy serving new customers and ringing them up, as late mornings look something like a post-locust plague landscape in terms of trash and spills left along table tops.  A little gross, but easy to fix.\\n\\nWeekday mornings can be just as tricky with parking, but folks are so much sitting around and drinking in the morning.  Great deal on a baker's dozen bagels on Wednesdays, which always makes you popular back in the office.\n\nAnswer:",

People were everywhere and it was easy to see that they were understaffed (poor waitress was running everywhere). We were seated and ordered fairly quickly as well. We waited 15 minutes to be seated....then an additional 45 minutes for our food. By the time we got our order, the restaurant was pretty much cleared out! Granted, everyone who was seated around our time also had to wait, but pho should be quick! Anyway, this is what we ordered:\\n\\nPho tai: The bf did not like the beef...said it was very chewy.\\n\\nPho (well done steak, brisket, tendon, tripe): I liked my dish. Meat was soft, tendon aplenty, and tripe was good too. The noodles were slightly undercooked though.\\n\\nEgg rolls: Skinny and EXTREMELY oily. There was a puddle of oil after we were done. Flavor was good though.\\n\\nOverall, we all agreed that our broth was a bit too bland and the noodles too hard. I think they ran out of ingredients and had to rush everything, hence the low quality of our meal. I will take into account that I am probably spoiled from living in the OC and LA area where pho is everywhere, but for the rating Kinh Do has, it should have been better. Honestly, I'm not sure if I will go here again when there are so many up and coming pho places in Vegas, but we'll see.\n\nAnswer:",

The guest room that we are in is really no different than what you might get at three star hotel.  The front desk and and receptionist aren't too friendly. The check-in process was disorganized. The room itself is older.  There is limited furniture and you can hear everyone in the hall.  The bed is comfortable though with clean sheets and a comforter that gets washed just as often. \\n\\nThe first room we were assigned to the key cards didn't work and people were making all sorts of crazy noise at noon across from us.  They moved us to another floor with working key cards.  The elevator setup seems efficient to regulate flow of traffic and the rooms are spaced well from the elevator. \\n\\nThe best perk about the room is the semi-large flat screen TV and the pretty bathroom tiles. The water pressure is very strong, too.  There is also a nice magnifying mirror, but in general the bathroom is small. \\n\\nMajor cons are small room and bathroom size, dated look, marked up walls, old furniture, no ice bucket, no fridge, no water heater, limited sink space.\\n\\nThere are a lot of on-site amenities... restaurants, food courts, and more. Also, this hotel is directly next to 24 hour CVS and Walgreens if you need anything. \\n\\nWe are only here one night in December.  We didn't use the pools.  I remember being here about 9 years ago and I liked the pools. Looks like the decor hasn't changed since then.\\n\\nAlso, the WiFi is spotty.  My iPad didn't pick up any connection but my MBP did.\\n\\nWe leave tomorrow night. I may write when our stay is finished. As of now my opinion is that it's a decent hotel, but more of a 3-star quality and overpriced for what it's worth.\n\nAnswer:",

Dr. Chen handled the injections very well, and did a great job at keeping me talking and distracted so that I didn't freak out too much.  \\n\\nThe technicians who did the actual MRI were good until the end - I wasn't sure if I needed to check out with the front desk or where to go and the girl who did my MRI basically shoed me out of the room without even showing me where I could change out of the hospital gown back into my clothes.  I left feeling rather disoriented.  Also, the injections are pretty painful and have left me pretty sore - since I can't take aspirin or ibuprofin (because of the dye injected or something?)

You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.  \\n\\nFirst let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty. \\n\\nLet's break down the meal.\\n\\nFried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum. \\n\\nCollard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.\\n\\nMac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal. \\n\\nHere we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!\\n\\nWhat in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.\\n\\nHere's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.  \\n\\nLike many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food.

Location was great in the Harrah's casino, but that's honestly the only thing that I can say was great. The waitress was friendly, and recommended a few items from the menu. I ordered her #1 choice of a fried bologna sandwich with french fries. The sandwich was completely saturated in grease. It's a grilled sandwich so I expected it to have some grease, but this was absurd. I ate about three bites. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips and it, too was covered in so much grease it was not edible. Needless to say we paid a hefty price for heartburn and stomach aches for the rest of the day.

We have been coming to Chang's since 2004 but the restaurant is now under new ownership. We experienced the WORST, actually it was NON EXISTENT service. The hostess was rude when she seated us. She brought over 2 forks, ignored me when I said we do not need them and then slammed them onto our plates and walked away.\\n\\nWhen we complained to the manager he told us the restaurant workers bring forks to Americans.

Do Italian restaurants bring Asian customers chop sticks? \\n\\nWhen it came time to pay our bill the same hostess who seated us point blank ignored our raised bill in the air and purposely did not take it.

He tapped her again with the bill in his had and she again ignored him. When she finally turned she looked at the bill in his hand and refused to take it, letting it drop to the floor when he handed it to her. At this point another restaurant employee came over and asked why the hostess did not take the bill. The hostess walked away and acted like it was not her job. When the other restaurant employee picked up the bill and came over to our table I asked her if the hostess is responsible for taking bills and ringing them up, she responded yes.\\n\\nWhen we complained to the owner of the restaurant he said my husband should not have tapped the hostess on the back.

In particular the croquetas and gambas al ajillo from the tapas menu were bigger than I expected. \\nFor entrees our party of 4 tried 3 of the 5 offerings: Suquet de Mariscos, Albondigas con arroz, Mixed grill. Everything was delicious. The rice almost out-shined the albondigas. Definitely inspired me to return to try their paella. \\nDesserts were good- light but sweet- however, definitely not as memorable as the tapas and platos. \\nMusic was not too loud and well-selected, playing one of my favorites from Barcelona, who had just been to CLT recently, Jarabe de Palo. \\nBeer selection also included a little taste of Catalu\\u00f1a including the more difficult to find in the States, Estrella Damm. \\nTo sum up, the food and drinks (including an affordable wine selection by glass) would definitely bring me back for a second try. \\nMy only negative, which may speak more to restaurant week than to Malabar, was that I did feel rushed. There definitely wasn't \\\"sobremesa\\\" time. The wait staff was attentive, maybe overly so. At one point the waitress tried to take my plate with my pan con tomate (which we ordered extra off the regular menu and was worth it) even before I was finished and my sangria glass when I still had some left in my glass.

The bar was really cool looking and we loved the idea of using green apples as paperweights. The selection of wine and beer was really decent for a place with a limited menu. The bartender, however, poured us pathetically small glasses of wine. It would have been ok if it appeared to be consistent, but we saw several glasses going out to tables that were much fuller. They weren't exorbitantly priced glasses, but I still want what I'm paying for!\\n  Next, the food. The zucchini fries were bland and fell apart, but the sauce that they came with was pretty tasty. The truffle fries were lacking in a good truffle flavor. Some of the fries in the basket were soggy and some were burnt. We sent most of them back. The veggie burger was super good. Just about one of the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted, surprisingly. The report from the ahi burger was \\\"ok\\\". The report from the Zinburger was \\\"ok and undercooked according to my order\\\". The sweet potato fries were delicious. \\n  The service was good. Elizabeth busted her butt to get us everything we needed, despite the clear lack of organization in the rest of the restaurant: The place had cleared out considerably by the time we ordered, and it still took about 30 minutes to get our food!\\n  As with most Fox Concepts, it's all concept and no substance.

More than a 100 reviews, and an average 5 star rating on Yelp? It's certainly rare to find a restaurant with 5 stars after this number of reviews.  I had to try it to believe it.\\n\\nFood (9.5/10) = Simply incredible.  The first time I visited Gaucho, I went with the most frequently mentioned Yelp item - the carne (steak) sandwich.  This sandwich is HUGE!  Generous portions of a cut of your choice.  I go for the ribeye, which is a great choice for flavor.  Other components of the sandwich include roasted red bell peppers, onions, chimmi churri sauce.  The bread just absorbs all the juices from the meat and roasted peppers, not letting any flavor go to waste.\\n\\nIf a sandwich is not your thing, there's certainly a variety of other proteins for your choosing, both from the land and sea.  I was surprised and impressed with how absolutely delicious Gaucho's camarones (shrimp) were.  I'm always weary of ordering seafood if I'm not near the coast line, with the concern for freshness.  But goddamn, these shrimps were hella succulent.  Sooo succulent.\\n\\nOther worthy proteins include the chorizo, chicken, and flank steak.\\n\\nIf you're in the mood for some vegetables, Gaucho's grilled corn, and their mix of asparagus, portabello, onions, peppers, zuchinni, are also great choices.\\n\\nIf you still need more flavor, there are 4 sauces to help enhance the experience:   1) chimmi churri (fresh herbs, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, vinegars), 2) pimenton (charred pepper, garlic, fresh herbs, extra virgin olive oil), 3) ajo (roasted garlic, fresh herbs & extra virgin olive oil), 4) cebolla (carmelized onion, rosemary, thyme, vinegars & extra virgin olive oil)\\n\\nService (10/10) = Family owned business are always great.  The two brothers running this joint never fail in making you feel welcome, and are full of energy and enthusiasm for the food they prepare.\\n\\nAmbiance (8.0/10) = The place is small and cozy, and unfortunately there are only a handful of stools for people to sit on, as they enjoy the greatness of Gaucho.\\n\\nOverall Opinion = Incredible food.  Awesome service.  What more could you possibly want?  Well, my only annoyance with this place are their business hours and the very limited number of seats for people to chill out and enjoy their food.  I heard they are about to expand, so this will solve the latter issue.  Their business hours were a major influence on why it took me more than half a year after moving to Pittsburgh to finally visit this place.  It would be great if they opened until at least 8 or 9 pm.  It would also be great if they opened on Sundays.  Nevertheless, their business is thriving, and certainly not short on customers.  Like I said in the beginning of this review, Gaucho had an average of 5 stars after 100 reviews.  I now understand why.  It is TRUTH!  Now make your pilgrimage to this fine establishment in the Strip District.\n\nAnswer:",

This location was, well, let's just say, it wasn't crowded.  And it showed in the service, very nice and attentive.  They were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people, then ballooned to 12 people, then 13.  Unfortunately, one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables 'attached' to our eight person round table.  I *hate* this.  It's just awkward for at least half the people, and then the people that get stuck at the 'junction'...sucks...\\n\\nWe ordered some apps, though the only one I tried was the saganaki.  It was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm.  For a meal, I ordered a gyro pita.  Now, I understand that this is a 'full' greek restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't have gone with a gyro, BUT, that's what I was in the mood for, and being a basic greek food, shouldn't be hard to make a good one right?  Well, apparently not.  I've probably gotten gyros at ten places around town, and this was definitely the worst one I've had.  The pita wasn't particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough.  The tzatziki was fine, but thought it was a little weird to be on the side.\\n\\nThe service was good and patient, but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables (when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together) knocks them down a little bit.

But in the past few months something happened... The service became bad, the portions smaller (we almost always order ala carte), occasionally the fish is very warm.

It was kind of disappointing, maybe because it was hyped up so much or perhaps because it was a Tuesday night dinner.  The line was 10-12 minutes long.  The presentation was great.  Service was just ok; we had to ask the waitress for refills on the drinks.  \\n\\nI liked the jumbo shrimp cocktail, dim sum, and cheese bar with grapes and dried apples.  The snow crab legs and skirt steak were on the salty side for me.  I was super disappointed with the sushi bar - only 3 kinds but no fresh fish that I remember.  I had the california roll and shrimp tempura roll which were tiny and flavorless.  Also wasn't impressed with the choice of soups, none of which sounded appealing so I didn't even try any.  No lobster tails.  There was a selection of 5 salads cutely presented in individual cups and the two I tried (thai beef salad and pear and gorgonzola) were nothing special.  Didn't touch the salad bar.  I didn't try the prime rib because my husband said it was \\\"ok\\\" and didn't seem too excited.  \\n\\nI felt like the dessert was about a third of my meal.  I really recommend the ice cream - the coffee ice cream was super strong and not very sweet, which was different.  I also had a coffee which tasted like a dark roast.  The made-to-order dessert crepe station was cool and the crepe was yummy, but there was only one guy making the crepe so there was quite a wait.  The strawberry shortcake and tiramisu were good but I've had better.\\n\\nIn fact, there were not too many food items that screamed out at me and that I feel I HAD to taste, which is a huge factor in my tepid rating of this place.  It was good but I wasn't blown away.\n\nAnswer:",

I usually attend the Hooters at the Tropicana hotel or at Sunset Station casino but I was leaving church off the strip and ready to catch the NFL season openers of football.\\n\\nA few friends and I decided to go to this Hooters location for some food and football. As soon as we arrived and walked into the resturaunt the host advised that Directv was down all over Vegas and they're only showing local tv games. Huge upset for NFL fanatics such as ourselves. Since we made the drive thus far we decided to stay. The waitress was very friendly and funny. Grabbed our drink orders as soon as we sat down and quickly brought them out but then again we were the only 4 customers.\\n\\nFood was ok. I ordered steak nachos and was expecting carne asada or actual steak on my nachos but that's what I get for assuming. The portion of nachos was great. Huge plate, mounted with nachos. My nachos were kinda good but mostly upsetting. The steak was like steak umms (TM) sandwich meat, the cheese was obviously from a can and was just heated up instead of being shredded or fresh cheese, and there was more jalapenos than steak, chips, and cheese. My friends had steak quesadillas that were delicious and I wish I would've ordered those instead.\\n\\nOverall the location is kinda in the middle of nowhere and the food isn't all that its hyped up to be. And the fact the host told us that Directv was down all over Vegas, even casinos, and nobody was able to watch the games was a complete lie. I have Directv at home and had friends a casinos who was able to view all games. Not really knocking this location but me personally, I'll never spend my money at this Hooters ever again.\n\nAnswer:",

Yeah I know, penalizing them for not \\\"healthy\\\" is probably silly as you know when going to let's say a fast food joint you are not eating so good. That being said the food at Defalco's is very high quality - almost as if you are in Italy and am not comparing it to fast food.\\n\\nI suggest you wait to try out Defalco's when not in a rush as its worth the wait. There order system is very similar to local places back east (basically avoiding technology) and that probably ties into part of the slower process of ordering and getting your food. I am from back east (NY area) and finding a good Italian deli / grocery store in the Phoenix area is not an easy task. A friend introduced me to Defalco's and anytime I am headed south on Scottsdale road (which is often) and after passing Thomas my stomach seems to pick up we are near Defalco's as it starts giving me the rumble noise.\\n\\nI have tried many things on the menu such as Eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken Parmigiana, and Cheese steak and three of those are worth a shot. I recommend to bring a friend and each get a different large sandwich and share.\n\nAnswer:",

I could only eat half and was sad to not be able to bring home the other half since we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room. What a waste! I hate wasting food! I should have totally shared. The prices of the pizza was around $15 but it's pretty darn big and yummy. WAY better than CPK which is roughly around the same price and yet a tad smaller.\\n\\nBut the worst thing about this place is its service! We waited a long long time until they finally took our order and waited over 40 minutes until our food was finally cooked. It was an insane amount of time. This was on a Tuesday night! It wasn't even a weekend but I guess they were still busy. But I still personally feel waiting nearly an hour is just absurd and retarded. They did take one of our meals off because we complained but it was just the $8 soup taken out. They should have given us 50% off the whole bill since we waited so very long.\\n\\nSo next time you come here. Share the pizza and enjoy it!

They also have tons of different sauces which they give to you on the side.

So just as we started to think that McD's was our only option we said, hey, there's that place, why not. So we walked in and, if you ever wanted to feel really unwelcome in a place...go here. There was a \\\"Seat Yourself\\\" sign, all the service staff ignored us and the place was filled with 50+/- year old men. It was one of those places where everyone kind of quieted down and looked at you when you walked in, leading you to believe that perhaps there's more going on there than an eating establishment, I'm not saying there is, I'm just saying. Now I'll preface this next part by saying I recently got a dog and have become one of those obnoxious people who gets annoyed with places that don't have dog friendly patios. We walked up to the bar and asked the bartender if they had a dog friendly patio and he said sure, go have a seat out there and he'd send someone right out. We went and got the pup from the car and had a seat. The girl who waited on us was really sweet, and the nicest person we encountered there, by far. As we sat she came out and said that the dog had to be on the outside of the fence. So basically, their patio is dog friendly in that you can tie your dog up to the outside of the fence and let it sit on the sidewalk outside. Anyway, we ordered 2 prickly pear margaritas, which are always delicious! I had the sandwich with roast beef, horseradish mayo, pepper jack cheese, grilled green chile and tomato. It was really tasty, the bread was nice and soft and not overly greasy like a lot of places tend to make toast. They had quite a few options for sides which was nice, I got the tater tots which were AWESOME! Nice and hot and crispy, fluffy and soft on the inside. \\n\\nIn summary, their food is actually quite nice, service is so-so, the peanuts thing seems pretty cool and I can see how that would be appealing. It seems to be a locals bar, we seemed to be the only ones there that the server did not know our names. Plenty of guys started showing up for the Monday night game, so I can definitely see that it probably gets busy when the games are on. Overall, not a bad place, I would go back if I were up in that area.\n\nAnswer:",

Yes you have to pay for everything from bags to water, but the saying does apply for this airlines.. \\\"You get what you pay for\\\".\\n\\nI never pay for my bags, i pack light and bring a small backpack that can hold 3-4 days worth of clothes plus toiletries (pants, shirts, socks, underware, bra's) most of these items can be worn more than once so it makes no sense to pay $35 a bag for both flights. I also never pick the seat i want to seat in, they give you an option to make the selection random and to be honest, i don't care where i seat, especially since i don't have to pay that way. I've flown enough to know it really does not matter where you sit, it's still going to be some what uncomfortable. The only real gripe i have for this airlines is the fact that the seats don't go back. My flights are only 2 hrs long but due to the time when the flights leave, (12:55 am)  it would nice to be able to close my eyes for a little bit comfortably. I have invested in a Plane Pillow which works wonderfully no matter the seat I'm in. \\n\\nAll in all, if your cheap like me :) than you will appreciate this low cost airlines, especially paying between $75 - $150 for a round trip ticket (which is unheard of nowadays) \\n\\nHope this helps anyone out trying to decide if Spirit Airlines is the best way to go.\\n\\nShelly\n\nAnswer:",

Instead of getting a Sprite, I got a Coke. I quickly walked back over and asked them if I could quickly get my Sprite. The worker was less than nice and took his sweet damn time getting me a Sprite.

I asked him if that's mine and he's like, \\\"uhhh...no.\\\" So I get my cup, totally relieved-- then I noticed that the cup felt light. I opened the cup to see that it wasn't even filled all of the way and with little ice and no bubbles. Hmm...a clear liquid with no bubbles; does that sound like Sprite to you? No, and it wasn't. It was water (not even cold too). So now I am pissed because I told this punk politely for Sprite at least TWICE. So I go into the restaurant and get it replaced. Then the manager asked me if I got my order and I said yes. Now I'm thinking that my meal is also wrong. I go back into my car to find they did give me the wrong meal.

Then a week later I'm back in and now they have more of these books, but now at 30p so I ended up buying 5 more - 5 books for \\u00a31.50.

The Paris was relatively close to our hotel, saw the strip-side seating of the Mon Ami Gabi and thought it looked about as good as any other place.\\n\\nService started out a little slow.

Could possibly have something to do with the fact we were starving, but the bread, quite literally, was the best thing we'd ever eaten.  Okay, maybe not the best, but it was pretty dang good.\\n\\nI decided to order the Chicken and Mushroom Crepe topped with kale and brie.  A very hearty portion, and super satisfying.  The flavor was reminiscent of the very best comfort food you can imagine.  A pure pleasure to eat.  Everything went well together, and all ingredients had a perfect balance.\\n\\nMy husband got the Classique Steak Frites with maitre d' butter.  His hangar steak was cooked perfectly, and the frites were something special.  We've seen many frites entrees that looked like they opened up a bag of frozen french fries and threw in the deep fryer.  But these were like a chip/fry hybrid.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Definitely homemade, or if not, they chose a wonderfully unique product.\\n\\nI recommend Mon Ami Gabi with two thumbs up.

I went to check this place out after seeing it on DDD. It looked interesting and the food looked like it could be pretty good. Well, not to sound mean or anything but, I can make much better breakfast in my own kitchen for about half the price. Any Denny's in America makes a better breakfast and you don't have to wait in line for an hour and a half either. Im sorry but I just don't get it. The only thing that \\\"wasn't\\\" completely average was the bacon. The portions were WAY to small and the food was WAY, WAY over priced. \\\"Good food, good portion size, good price\\\". This place breaks all 3 of those rules. Come on people lets stop following the crowd and lets try and open our minds a little. If everyone would do that I don't think Matts would be in business much longer.\n\nAnswer:",

With some good reviews we thought it would be a good place to eat. Upon walking in, the restaurant was messy... didn't look like much. After sitting down we look at a menu and about had a heart attack... the cheapest dinner on there was $15!!!! Sooo not worth it! \\n\\nWe both ordered fried chicken. I had string beans... wayy to salty... all I could taste was the Lawry's seasoned salt, which was overwhelming. We both had the macaroni and cheese... not very good at all either. It was bland not much too it, wasn't the cheesy goodness I was looking for. We also both had french fries... they were gross too. They were cooked in the same old grease that everything else was cooked in... including the fish. They were soft and just horrible tasting. My husband had the rice and gravy... iI thought it was mashed potatoes and gravy. The rice was lumpy and was nasty. How hard is it to cook white rice. The gravy on the other hand was good, he says the only good thing about the experience. We both had the fried chicken that was bland and you could taste fish and old grease... The cornbread was alright, just needed to be served with some butter... it was a little burnt as well. \\n\\nI AM WHITE AND COOK BETTER SOUL FOOD THAN THIS PLACE! \\n\\nWe will definitely not be coming back here.

Pretty good selection of dishes and I think the most appealing thing about this buffet is that they served almost everything on mini dishes so you could grab and move on instead of having to scoop it onto your plate...which takes up more time and when you have hungry ppl you want them to move quick. \\n\\nI really liked their smoked sausage mac & cheese, their cocktail shrimp, the buttersquash ravioli and one dish called the dirty rice...which was pretty tasty. Stay away from the green curry clams because I scooped up a bunch of empty shells.-_-\\\"\\n\\nThey dessert selection was also pretty awesome.... miniature scoops of gelato of your choice...different miniature desserts but I would definitely stay away from the chocolate covered strawberries....they were pretty bad...the strawberries were sour and when you bite into the strawberry the chocolate breaks apart because it's so hard.\\n\\nI would give this buffet a 3stars and half....not quite on my top list yet...hah Kinda over-rated if you ask me but hey for $23 bucks for brunch it's pretty good...and you get a free alcoholic drink for each person in the party....not that that appeals to me since I don't drink but for those that do I would think it's a plus. =) my bf had his mimosa and mine...lol\\n\\nWould come back again...located in the Cosmopolitan hotel...which btw is a pretty blinged-up, glitzy hotel..lol\n\nAnswer:",

Yes, Joe, this one goes out to your pretentious ass.\\n\\nI went to XS for Tiesto night with three other girls after being promised by two different legit hosts that we would be able to get in on the reduced admission guest list ($20 for girls, $50 for guys). We were in line by 10 pm and did everything as we were told. When we got to the front of the line, however, Joe stopped us and told us there was no such thing as a reduced admission guest list. My friend and I whipped out our cell phones to show him the text messages we'd received literally minutes ago from our promoters, who were both working at Tryst that night. Joe basically told us he thought we were bullshitting (even though we told him he could check the numbers) and said he was only doing his job and we would have to pay $100 to get in (after telling our other friends $75 about 20 minutes earlier). Um... I'm sorry? I understand it's Tiesto night, but it's not even 11 pm, we're four girls on the guest list, and you're telling us to pay $100 to get into your club? We pointed out the absurdity of this and Joe told us in the rudest, most sarcastic tone ever that the only way he would accept proof of the \\\"reduced admission guest list\\\" we claimed existed was if we dragged one of our promoters over from Tryst to walk us in. We asked, very patiently, if we could go over and get a video recording or signature or something as proof. He said no and refused to offer a reason why, instead telling us over and over again to step out of line. \\n\\nBy this point we were tired of wasting time when he was just being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole so we finally complied, but instead of leaving we went to go talk to Eric, who wrote us a slip within 10 seconds of us showing him our texts. After we got in my friend went to go give Joe a piece of her mind, and he conveniently slammed the door in her face.\\n\\nFYI, Joe, just because you're having a miserable night doesn't mean you have to ruin ours.\n\nAnswer:",

I mean there are murmurs that this place Steve Wynn's favorite place in the hotel so this really has to be a knockout of a place right? You wouldn't waste the view overlooking the entire golf course with something mediocre right? This is the Wynn which is supposed to be the Las Vegas best of the best RIGHT?\\n\\nSadly wrong on all counts and lets just say I was thoroughly let down. So much so I have turned 2 people away from eating here already. Look if I ruin how I feel about the meal this early in the review you have to know it was just that lackluster...\\n\\nSo I made a reservation as it was advised this place can get very busy and it was a Friday afternoon. I walked in and was greeted pleasantly by the team at the front podium and was sat very promptly.  My table was at the glass and no matter where you sit you have a great view of the entire Wynn golf course.  The chairs were even real comfy which was just a great sign that they wanted to think every detail through of your dining experience. Things were looking up, right?\\n\\nOur waiter came and dropped of the menu and an option vegan menu. It took me a second but, then I realized there was no wine or drink menu. I asked the waiter for this and it was brought over in a relatively timely manner. The actual menu is simple and covers pretty much every option you would expect for lunch dining with more than 3 items on it that looked good. When the waiter came back we ordered a nice white wine from France to get things started. This is sadly where things started to slide downhill. The waiter pinged back and forth a few times before I waived him down and gave him my food order (for me tomato & mozzarella salad and the chicken club sandwich). After a while of wondering where my wine was the waiter informed us that they didnt have what was ordered and brought a bottle of something from Oregon and a different varietal. Now let me stop here if I was at the Olive Garden this wouldnt be a big deal but the reputation and more importantly the PRICE of this place means they are held to a higher standard. The bottle was declined and I asked for an alternate on the menu. The waiter seemed confused. The wine list isnt very long so knowing whats on it should not be that hard.\\n\\nNow the first course came out (salad for me and soup for my companion) and I was eager to try the food. Sadly another let down as my salad was just bland. I had to waive down the waiter for salt as there was none on the table. So up until this point if you read my review you might think I was real picky and just kind of a harsh critic but, really what it comes down to is again at this price level you have certain expectations and they were being dragged down in a very fast fashion. Finally the wine was brought out and I was able to enjoy it alongside my food. And that is when my waiter disappeared for about 15 minutes. So whenever I ran out of wine I had to reach over and do it myself.\\n\\nThe main course came out from the kitchen which looked amazing and we were still having to constantly refill our own wine. Now the chicken sandwich had a real good flavor of well cooked chicken, the sauces, and the soft bread. Really this was the only positive part of the meal and its saving grace for me. My dining companion ordered an item off the vegan menu (a mushroom napoleon)  and was unfortunately let down by the flavor.\\n\\nI really cant tell you how much I wanted to like this place and maybe thats why I am so let down. Sub par service and so so food make this place a must skip as far as I am concerned. Wish that wasnt the case!\n\nAnswer:",

I think sometimes it's because it's closer to the strip?? We paid almost $200. That's a lot of money in my opinion. I have a hard time with it because I can get just as good Indian food in a 100% comparable location nearby.\\n\\nWe came here on Friday night with some friends.

It was a very blunt taste of curry, yogurt and a uncooked mushroom that was breaded.\\nSaag Paneer - Very good\\nShrimp Tikka Masala - Sauce was very tasty and rich. \\nLamb Rogan Josh - The sauce was okay. I felt they used a little too much curry and it over powered the dish with that and nutmeg.\\nChicken Mukhani - We actually don't think this was the right dish. It came out and the sauce didn't taste like it normally would for chicken mukhani. It was a bit thinner and not thick like butter chicken typically is. \\nLamb Vindaloo - good flavor, nice and tender meat. \\n\\nOverall - the service was not good. It took us over an hour to get all of our food. Mainly because the waiter was not coming around to ask if we were ready to order. It was not busy, maybe 5-6 tables total. On Friday nights at 7, it's packed at a lot of places. So, that could be a sign if they're not busy. \\nAgain, the food was good - not amazing for a pricier menu.

Really Simple... \\n\\n\\nNah seriously, this is a good breakfast, solid contender. You can get Hash-browns or Home Fries. The Home Fries are always my first choice anywhere and here they get topped with this onion-pepper mixture after -cooking which I am not a big fan of though. So, I ask them to leave it off and then request the potatoes be cooked crisply- about half the time does it come out right, but that is OK, when it actually gets done it makes it a 5 star awesome breakfast! \\n\\nTook my brother and his family to breakfast and they really liked it. My brother got a 'Joe Bear Scramble' which he liked and was plated so appealingly, the lady at the table next to us saw his and ordered this for herself. SIL got the HUGE Chicken Fried Steak and really liked it, she is finicky so this is good. 7YO Nephew got the Cinnamon Roll French Toast (4 pcs) which he liked. But, we had to order him a side of bacon because it does not come with any meat. Hard to justify $10 plus breakfast for a 7year old but oh well, I stole a bacon leaving him 3 pieces which he gobbled up! Suggestion, half the order and add bacon as another option, the pieces are large enough to make this a solid plate for women or kids. \\n\\nThe interior is on old Denny's and needs to be refreshed soon and parking can get tricky after 9:30am on a Sunday. \\n\\nSo, if you are in town for NASCAR or Spring Training at Goodyear Ballpark, this location is right off I-10 (Southwest side). Go here or to Mimi's (Northwest side)) for breakfast, but please, stay in Goodyear and keep businesses thriving so I have a job. Thanks :) \\n\\nTo get 5 stars I would say ramp up the home fries a bit, they are missing something but I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe use fresh onion without the bell-peppers (their \\\"mix\\\" seems to be pre-made frozen prepped kind) and cook with the potatoes to caramelize versus heaping them on after in a wet mess?

Also, there was no line to get in.\\n\\nI particularly enjoyed the kobe beef top sirloin (dinner only) but was a little dismayed by how rare my cut was.  The veal osso bucco was excellent and tender, the meat was very soft and well-flavored.  The paella was also delicious but a little runny.  There was a large selection of grilled/baked/steamed/what have you fish filets, including tilapia, salmon, and cod.  I particularly liked their cod.  The sushi selection is limited, featuring only the usual suspects you'd see anywhere that serves sushi and nigiri.  No eel :(\\n\\nAs for the snow crab legs, they were cold (but aren't they cold everywhere?).  My only real complaint is that they were kind of too salty.  I didn't gorge on those like I normally do at buffets, but that's fine since I was saving room for dessert.\\n\\nThe dessert selection was impressive.  Not only was it vast but the pre-plated desserts were actually complex and innovative, not just variations on yellow cake.  The banana walnut cake was a sleeper hit -- it was amazing and actually distinguished itself from a banana walnut muffin that I'm so used to eating.  The tirimisu had a real alcoholic kick, which I liked.  The miniature ice cream cones filled with vanilla or dark chocolate cremes were delicious -- bonus points to the vanilla one because its cone is lined with nutella on the inside.  As for the un-plated desserts, like bread pudding and bananas foster, I did not try them.  They appeared to be forgotten and unappealing since that section of the dessert bar was not even lighted... o.O \\n\\nOverall I was satisfied with eating at The Big B.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, checking up regularly and bringing us our drinks in a timely manner.  Entree foods that aren't supposed to be oily were not oily -- nothing was heavier than it should be.  So many buffets have trouble with this, but Bellagio's does not.

Unfortunately, the day of my wedding was horrible.  My fault that I didn't go in for a practice run, BUT I was assured by their ANSWERING SERVICE that I would get \\\"one of their best,\\\" because that's who they send out.  The lady that came to our hotel room to do our (my mom and me) hair was rude and not talented.  She barely spoke and when she did it was defensive and not from a place of yes.  When a bridesmaid (who went to DryBar to get her hair done and wasn't satisfied) agreed with me that my hair style should be fixed, the stylist looked at her phone and said,\\\"well, what time is it?\\\" as she argued with us that she couldn't do anything else with my hair because it's fine.  We were like \\\"we don't care what time it is, it's my wedding, and I will pay you whatever it takes to get my hair looking the way I want it.\\\"  My mom hated her hair, took pictures to send to DryBar and then fixed it herself.  The problem with getting a quick solution is that they have an answering service which makes problem solving an issue, especially when you have limited time and makes scheduling a large group complicated.  Again, I've been happy once or twice, they have a few good stylists and a lot of very mediocre ones.  I think I'll try some of the other blowdry bars in town.\n\nAnswer:",

The rate had been agreed when I came in: $20. When I went to pay at the front,  I said to the owner, Wendy, that I was not thrilled with how it looked, but I had to leave for school pickup. She said,   \\\"OK, five dollar off.\\\" So I handed over $15.  She said, rudely, \\\"No! You owe twenty! Extra for taking off your old polish!\\\" I said that no, we had agreed on the price when I arrived and she saw that my nails needed polish removal.\\n\\nThat was when she GRABBED my cell phone from off the counter and said, \\\"You pay twenty or I keep your phone!\\\" (!!!!!!!!) I calmly said to please give me my phone, I would pay her. After she handed it back, I said, \\\" You cannot change the price after the service. I am not even happy with this, but I have still paid you. Goodbye.\\\"  No insults, no profanity, no yelling. I was holding her business card in my hand, and she grabbed roughly from my hand and crumbled it into a ball. (!!!!!) I had a few singles I had planned to walk back and give to the tech, but I was getting kind of nervous and upset.\\n\\n\\nAs I turned to go, she ran out in front of me and STEPPED ON MY FOOT! This caused me to lose my balance and my flip flop went spinning across the floor, and she kicked it even further. (!!!!!) Plus,  there were a few other customers in pedicure chairs watching, and I said, \\\"Do you really want to do this? Assault a customer who has just paid you? Really?\\\" Then another worker went up to her and spoke in Vietnamese, and she glared at me and said, \\\" I call police on you! \\\" I said to go ahead! She would be the one in trouble. But I was actually scared she was going to strike me!\\n\\nSo I fled, heart pounding, with nails that look sub par. I would never return, obviously. Wendy should be ashamed of herself.

We happily sat at the bar where we enjoyed the bartender, Joby as well as the sommelier, Amy Binkley's service. \\n\\nAfter a great wine recommendation, we ordered the beets and the burratta. Both were served in approx. 5 minutes after we ordered. And both were so tasty! We also received a little gift from the Chef, an order of sweet and sour sweetbreads, which were delicious! And not something I would usually order so it was a great treat. \\n\\nNext we asked for help choosing between the cauliflower and the broccoli. Joby said to go with the broccoli and he was spot on! Finally, we ordered the risotto and it was the best part of our meal. We wanted seconds, but opted to try a cake doughnut (just one!) before we finished up, paid our tab and headed home. \\n\\nThe bill for all of that food and a bottle of wine, only $80!!! \\n\\nMy review of this restaurant - incredible food, polite, accommodating service, overall wonderful experience.

It is also a deli, pasta shop, and first-rate emporium of memorable baked dessert treats.  A server was slow to take our order, based on some initial confusion over who was assigned our booth.  But, once that hiccup was alleviated, all was well.  She was a fine server, but I would have liked to have been informed of the dinner specials like Lobster Parm I later saw on a board.  A sign inside the restaurant reads \\\"Where love has a taste!\\\" and diners are reminded by another placard to be patient because all food here is cooked to order.  I found great taste in these environs, and the freshly prepared food well worth the wait. \\n\\nI was initially surprised to see that dinners are served here with complimentary freshly baked garlic knots and bread.  Then the surprise turned to shock when the bread and basted knots were placed on the table.  There were 24 Garlic Knots--for only 2 diners!  They were small, but so what?  The doughy knots were warm and quite tasty, and the huge number made up for their diminutive size.  A dozen accompanied us home.\\n\\nI was less impressed by the fresh but earthy Italian bread.  It was sort of dry, and not that tasty.  But this was a minor setback.  For the Stracciatella (Italian Egg Drop) Soup was the best I have ever had: really hot and tasty broth, and chockfull of spinach and egg whites.  An immense \\\"Caesars Salad\\\" with one anchovy as requested, chopped Romaine, Romano Cheese, and fresh croutons was very good but almost overdressed with too much Creamy Caesar Dressing.  \\n\\nA Shrimp Cocktail featured 8 large shrimp that were good but tasted like they had recently been defrosted.  But I harbored no reservations at all concerning my entree of delectable Veal Montesano over Fettuccine, which was simply superb.  This very creative dish featured nicely pounded and tender, hand sliced, and lightly floured milk-fed veal medallions, artichoke hearts, fresh garlic, roasted potatoes, and roasted red peppers, and was finished in a delicate white wine and butter sauce in a brick oven.  The fragile artichoke petals gave the sauce a welcome hint of lemony flavoring.  And the fresh pasta undergirding the veal was cooked perfectly!  The whole edible conglomeration represented a delicious and very nice blend of harmonizing flavors.\\n\\nBut I was by no means done, because a lovely, large \\\"Black & White Cookie\\\" in the display case had caught my eye when I entered the restaurant.  I went back to get a good second look, and then ordered it for dessert.  The unusual cookie, freshly baked on premises, was composed of pound cake topped by vanilla icing on one half, and chocolate icing on the other, and was moist and delectable.  The pure vanilla and chocolate flavors startled my taste buds.  Diane's novel idea of biting down on the black and white border to take in both flavors at once was a definite winner.  And, that lovely cookie was so rich that half of it accompanied me home, and even that amount lasted two more lunches!  \\n\\nAffable owner/chef Steven Montesano, attired mostly in red, flitted in and out of the kitchen, watched the front of the house, and came over to our booth to check on us a few times during the course of our meal.  He was a very cordial and accommodating host, and it is obvious that he takes great pride in his fine cooking and baking.  Deservedly so!\\n\\n4-1/2 stars overall!\n\nAnswer:",

Waited nearly 5 minutes to be seated (there was no one in front of us when we got there).  First thing we see is a waitress complaining that the order she's holding was not what the customer wanted, and another waitress was kind of arguing with her about it.  FInally got seated, then waited at least another 5 minutes before our waitress came by, who happened to be the complaining waitress above.  She asked what we wanted to drink, my wife said coffee, and then I told her we're ready to order.  She then said we'll have to wait a minute and took off.  Again, we waited another 5 minutes, no coffee in sight, and noticed no one was getting their food, and another waitress was apologizing to folks about why it was taking so long.

It's a shame, because I really like this place normally and the atmosphere is kinda cool if you are in a \\\"sports mood\\\".  The problem tonight seems that although there are employees literally everywhere, for some reason there is only one bartender.  I could throw my theories out there...that the bartenders that work here get upset if management puts more than one on a shift because it eats into tips but other than that, I really have no idea why somebody wouldnt pitch in OR that the bartender wouldnt step up and insist on a hand because we all sat there for 20 minutes with empty glasses in front of us while she ran back and forth and forth and back.  \\n\\nAt one point I said to her \\\"Wow!  You really seem overwhelmed back there...I can't believe that nobody else would be helping you back there\\\".  I could not believe that she had no clue as to what I was implying.  She said sweetly \\\"Oh...I dont mind...really I dont.  It makes the day go by quicker.\\\"  I said tongue in cheek that maybe you dont mind but I have a hunch that your customers do.  She just smiled.  \\n\\nThe owner was milling around too witnessing it all and doing less than nothing about it.  It was obvious.  The whole bar felt it.  I finally left without ordering another drink or a bite to eat as did my buddy.  I've gotta believe that this equation equals less money in tips at the end of the day than if two or three good bartenders ran it like a machine.  She sure didnt get much from me.  Sorry dear!

I suspect many are giving heavy handed reviews as this is a \\\"sentimental\\\" favorite.  I guess even my rating is slightly biased that way too.  But 5 stars people?  Meaning it cannot get any better than \\\"woohoo, as good as it gets\\\"?  Ok, I'll end my rant and get to the review.\\n\\nIn short, this is your typical old school Mandarin/Szechuan style chinese restaurant.  Decor is slightly tired, but who really cares about decor anyways for a neighborhood chinese restaurant?\\n\\nStaff couldn't have been friendlier.  It's family run (from what I gather) and take out service is quick and efficient.  They include almond cookies, sauces, utensils, and fortune cookies in a nice packet with your to go order.  Everything was packaged VERY well.\\n\\nThe menu is a diverse variety of your typical chinese items.  Be aware that some dishes (like the Moo Goo Gai Pan) have alternate names (like \\\"Snow White Chicken\\\").\\n\\nStill with me?  Good...on to the food.\\n\\nI ordered BBQ pork slices, Kung Pao Chicken, and a dish they called \\\"Bo Bo Shrimp\\\".  \\n\\nThe BBQ pork slices were generally not too fatty as they can be other places, however some pieces were sliced too thin as they were dry.  Also, the seasoning did not permeate the meat that much.  There was also no \\\"sauce\\\" (which is good, because Char Siu should not have any sauce per se).  Maybe I'm just spoiled with good BBQ pork, and I also realize it's just an appetizer, but could have been better and more flavorful.\\n\\nThe Kung Pao Chicken is very average.  First I'm appreciative of chinese restaurants that use dark meat instead of white as it's not dry.  But add to that a lot of peanuts that were a little overpowering (I felt like an elephant), lots of cubed green pepper and onion, and a lot of sauce made this the typical Kung Pao chicken.  Was it bad?  It wasn't bad, but not 5 stars great either.  I don't know if I really understand why Phoenix area chinese places are compelled to throw a ton of vegetables in Kung Pao.  It'd be nice for once to have a relatively vegetable-less \\\"meat\\\" dish and order vegetables separately (like how you order at better chinese places).  Compared to other places in Phoenix, it was probably better than what I've had, but again, not 5 stars \\\"amazing\\\".\\n\\nThe Bo Bo shrimp was a breaded shrimp dish with a spicy brown sauce.  On the positive, I tasted the ginger and garlic come out of the sauce, but the breading on the shrimp was so heavy it was falling off as I ate it.  Perhaps it was because it was take out and it got soggy, so I'll reserve some judgement for when I dine in person, but I've had plenty of take out and the shrimp are not always like that.  I would have preferred a lighter coating which can be achieved with a dusting of cornstarch.\\n\\nI can see why this place has gotten the accolades because relatively speaking, there isn't a lot of good accessible chinese food here in Phoenix (well, unless you go to Cofco Plaza, Lee Lee Market, Great Wall, etc.).  But again, there is much better around.\\n\\nWith that being said, if you've read my other reviews you'll see I am a big fan of locally run non-chain restaurants.  So don't let my review scare you too much, I'm just picky and have high expectations.  I certainly could have ordered items that are difficult to make poorly (Mushu pork, mongolian beef, etc.) but chose Kung Pao as it's difficult to pull off properly.  So please try this place for yourself and form your own opinion.  At least you have mine.\n\nAnswer:",

I booked a king standard room but when I arrived they were out of that room style so they gave me a room with two double beds and an Eiffel Tower view. I also had to leave about 15 items at the bell desk for co-workers and the staff was really accommodating. The view was great! The room wasn't anything super special and a little dated but nice overall with a pretty big bathroom. \\n\\nThere are a few good restaurants and bars in the hotel including Mon Ami Gabi and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. There is also a piano bar, Napoleans, that had some really talented pianists in the week I was there. There is also a club, Chateau here. The club is probably not a top club in Vegas but the view from the \\\"rooftop\\\" deck is great and the DJs were great the few times I went.\\n\\nThe location of the hotel is great, it is in the middle of the strip so you can walk almost anywhere. The hotel is connected to Ballys so you can get to monorail station without having to walk outside. \\n\\nI really enjoyed my stay here!

Such simple ingredients shouldn't be so difficult - rice, beans, tortilla shells...but you'd be surprised how bland these ingredients can be in the wrong hands.\\nI tried the Pittsburgh version of the California burrito and my friend had the fish tacos.  Even though there were supposed to be other ingredients the only thing I tasted was the heavy portion of carne asada and fries...maybe  a little cheese.  No Guac, no salsa to be seen.  I did like the crunch and flavor of the corn chips but the salsa needed about 1/2 bottle of Tapatio to give it some flavor and spice.  The best part of the burrito was the grilled tortilla shell which gave the burrito some crunch.\\nMy friend's fish tacos were also lacking in the flavor department - he decided to also dose it in Tapatio and then cut up the taco and mix it with the side of rice and beans.\\nSo no matter how late or drunk you are - pass by go and do not stop at Los Cabos.\n\nAnswer:",

Option: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive.\nText: Just came back from the restaurant tonight.  feel like sharing my experience with people.  The environment was very good.  Its hard to see such scale of restaurant locally.  The server told me that this restaurant cost about 2 million.  Each stove cost about 10 grand.  The smoke was sucked under neath, so your cloth will not smell after the meal. The menu looks pleasant. beautiful pictures.  Service was good.  He changed my grill 4 times during the meal.  These are all the good parts.  Now here comes the food.  the appetizer we ordered was spicy tuna volcano.  of 1 to 5, I will give it a one.  tuna has no flavor, the deep fried rice ball was hard.  two very different textures did not match well at all.  For the BBQ, I ordered scallop, Kalbi, Harami, Tongue, Chicken fondue.  They have 3 kinds of sauce, Ponzu, Sweet Soy, Spicy sauce.  The Ponzu was blend with out a kick or freshness.  The Sweet soy is too sweet that over powers the meat flavor easily, and you can just tell it was thickened by corn starch.  spicy sauce was Korean style base which was still on the sweet side.  So I am not impress with the sauce.  The scallop was fresh and I have no complaint.  But the meat is really just so so.  The reason is that the cut was bad.  some thick, some thin, some stringy, some wide.  they just want to make it to the weight, (which is only 4 to 5 oz. per order) for $9.00!  And they cut the meat along the grain.  which is a huge no no for bbq.  I feel like they want to cut cost by using the end parts and cut the meat any way they can to make the portion.  The marinate was too sweet and overpowering the meat flavor.  However the marinate flavor was not too bad, So if you like Korean bbq style, you will like it but If you like real Japanese BBQ, you should go try Yagyu( the 2 story building by the China town) They do it right.  The chicken, they use breast, which is very dry, and the fondue is just not what I am expecting when I am trying to eat bbq.  The cheese was overpowering.  The chicken was sticking on the grill.  The grill they use is metal, really easy to get blacken by the sweet sauce.  thats why the server has to change it so often(in the middle of your cooking)  I prefer Yagyu's.  They use cast iron grill, you can put a block of beef fat on it to enhance the flavor.  And the chicken will not stick.  Because yagyu is the first \\\"Japanese\\\" bbq place in town, so I compare between the two a lot.  For the draft beer, hands down yagyu is far better.  The mug was stored below freezing.  So when the beer comes, the whole mug is covered with frost and the beer was frozen in side the mug and float to the top.  If you are beer lover, you really have to go try Yagyu's draft beer.  Tonight's beer just looks sad.  And I don't like their rice.  To me, a perfectly cooked rice is just as important as the meat.  because you eat them together.  Rice brand or the type of grain of the rice was not good.  For $1.95 a bowl, they should put out something better.  Over all, for the environment, and if you want to impress some people, they will do the job.  The food is acceptable.  But for the bbq, Yagyu is the way to go.\n\nAnswer:",

It made me feel very uncomfortable and if I was ever going to steal any thing from that store it would have been the nail polish which was located at the register. There really is nothing in here I couldn't live without but I did find a really cute cardigan for my nephew. The employees were pleasant while they were checking me out but the whole time the security guard stood by the register watching but not watching (if that makes sense). Really ackward!\\n\\nMy second visit (same day but later) was to exchange the cardigan I bought for my nephew for a bigger size. There was the same security guard standing around and only one worker who told me she was a new employee. I let her know I just needed to exchange the cardigan for a bigger size and she told me that she couldn't do exchanges or returns and I would have to wait for the store manager to get back from her lunch. I asked how long and she said about 15 more minutes. So I went back out to my car and sat for 20 minutes just so I could exchange this cardigan! I was upset that I had to wait so long just to do an exchange when I bought the cardigan earlier in the morning. Although the store manager was polite when doing the exchange, she never apoligized for making me wait around for 20 minutes.\\n\\nHow can you leave an employee on their own when they do not know or have any authority to do exchanges or returns?!\\n\\nIt will be awhile before I ever go back to this store if ever.\n\nAnswer:",

The meatballs were tasty, although my friend thought they tasted off.  Flavors were simple and fresh, so that was a better part of my meal.\\n\\nThe caprese on the other hand was not as good.  Personal preference (and perhaps because I'm a traditionalist) is the tomatoes and mozzarella are sliced so that the can be eaten together - the salad was more of the \\\"cubed\\\" variety, with large chunks of tomato and mozzarella tossed with the shallot and dressing and presented on a plate but not really in an orderly fashion.  Granted, anybody can take pieces and cut them up and stack on a fork to get the medley of flavors together, but that seemed to be a little bit of a miss for me.  More importantly though, were the ingredients.  The mozzarella, while housemade, was good, it was no where near \\\"creamy\\\", rather it tasted almost too firm/dry.  Also, the heirloom tomatoes did not have as much flavor as I expect from heirlooms and were disappointing.  Could have certainly been a bad tomato, but I was hoping for something riper, sweeter, and overall tastier.  \\n\\nEntrees were the short ribs and the duck confit flatbread.  The short ribs have gotten generally good reviews so I was eager to try them, and unfortunately they were average.  While the flavors were good, they were a touch overcooked, because while the meat was soft, there were parts that were dry and a little stringy.  Granted, it was late that we dined and they were probably would have been much better if we got them 1-2 hours prior.  The overall flavor was good (not great).  \\n\\nFinally, the duck confit flatbread was very average.  The duck and portabello mushroom were a good combo and everything (including the Medjool date bbq sauce) tasted very \\\"umami\\\", but the flavors really didn't meld as much as they should have.\\n\\nOverall, the idea is great, but menu and prep need to be refined a little bit for me to go back.  I'm always dumbfounded by 5 star reviews Yelpers give out like Cheerios to toddlers, which means either: a) I'm reviewing the wrong restaurant, b) the experience I had was just an off night (unlikely), or c) the reviewers really don't know what a 5 star restaurant should be.  Who knows.  This place has great potential, just missed the mark in my dining experience.\n\nAnswer:",

I had the black mold and other various issues as well but I was looking for a house so I was just buying time.\\n\\nThe reason for 1 star is the absolutely horrible customer relation skills-or lack there of. Of all the employees and especially management. Don't ever expect to get things taken care of in a timely manner and do expect attitude for even trying to get something fixed. If you ever have a problem you are seriously sol. I would check the be be be site on these guise before even attempting renting from here. \\n\\nEspecially for a single lady I would seriously avoid.

Not professional, and not ok.  \\nWe were provided with complementary chips and dip which were very tasty.  Unfortunately, that was where the tastiness ended.  Our dinners were awful.  \\nMy husband had a steak which was about the quality you would expect from applebees, only it was 26.95.  That doesn't sound like much but it was an awful steak, very fatty, not cooked well and with almost no flavor.  And that was just for the steak - the sides are a la carte.  So we ordered the mac n cheese for 6.25 which was ok but had some kind of funky cheese in it that gave it a slightly weird taste.  It was probably the best part of the meal but no something I would ever order again.  I had the cobb salad for 15.25 and that was a huge let down.  Dressing was gross, chicken was gross, overall it was just sub par.  \\nWe decided to make up for the rest of the meal with some dessert.  Maybe not the best idea....\\nMy husband ordered an espresso (4.25) that came half full and cold.  We also ordered the chocolate chip cookie desert for 8.25 which was pretty good except that the icecream was caramel ribbon (or something caramel) which was way too sweet to go with the cookie.  Plain vanilla would have been much better, the dish was entirely too sweet and this is coming from two individuals with HUGE sweet tooths.  \\nLong story short, this restaurant is overpriced and the food is not good.  I would never go back and I would never recommend it to anyone.\n\nAnswer:",

After reading favorable reviews on one-star hotels and motels, I decided to stay here at the Crestwood Suites right off of Las Vegas Boulevard, just a few minutes south from the strip.  While being able to get good night's rest on my one-night stay, the room and its facilities have their fair share of pros and cons.\\n\\nOn the positive side, the place has a very nice price point, basic amenities and friendly customer service.  Reserving via Priceline's website, not utilizing the \\\"name your own price\\\" service, the daily rate of $58 per night was affordable.  The room has all of the basic amenities, like shampoo, soap, iron and iron board, etc.  There's even a stove, refrigerator, cabinets and sink.  And also for a local hotel to have a good caliber of customer service, concern and interaction, at least that brought a lot of ease in my mind.\\n\\nHowever, I believe all those pluses don't cover up the two drawbacks of this place.  First off is the presence of the remnant secondhand cigarette smoke in the hallway and my room, which is on the first floor wing.  On top of hotel patrons, I personally couldn't believe how maids could make a living cleaning the rooms with this \\\"stench\\\" of a smell present.  Plus it personally sucks to have my clean clothes be adored with this type of smell!  Also, the room sofa has that small, yet disgusting, dry white stain sort of similar to Monica Lewinsky's \\\"blue dress.\\\"\\n\\nDespite these findings, the hotel is okay to stay in.  My recommendation for those who want to \\\"roll the dice\\\" by saving your money and their lungs, request a different room higher than the first floor or look somewhere else.\n\nAnswer:",

The facility is nice for an indoor soccer facility, with the exception of the bathrooms.  The team fee is a little pricey for an eight week round, on top of the $50 first-year membership fee ($35 to renew after that).  PLUS, like someone else mentioned, you also have to pay the refs on top of those other fees.  \\n\\nOne thing I have to point out with this facility is that they allow teams who shouldn't be lower than a B-league to play in the co-ed recreational D-league.  This is unfair because \\\"recreational\\\" indicates fun, NOT competitive.  Half the people on my team come out to have fun, & have never seen a soccer ball until now, so to put them out there with people who have played for their whole life, who come out shoving & elbowing isn't a fair game at all.  \\n\\nThe biggest complaint I have is that the refs play on the teams, so they are pretty partial to the team they play for or the people they pal around with.  Some of them are very fair, but some of them are a bit ridiculous with their calls.  \\n\\nOther than that, great facility; just some frustrating things going on.  My team will probably go elsewhere for at least a few rounds of soccer because of the above-mentioned things, but it's not the worst facility in the world, so if you can deal with some fairly mild obnoxiousness resulting from the politics of the place, I'd recommend it.

I really like this place...on weeknights, at happy hour, when it's not catering to the Drunken-Nightclub-Hopping-Touristy crowd. I really hate this place on some random weekend nights, when it seems to be a completely different place. It happened to me once, and I've not been brave enough to try a weekend since. Maybe it's not that bad every time.\\n\\nOne of the things I miss most from Chicago are the cocktail bars (Violet Hour, Weegee's), and on some nights of the week, the Downtown fills that niche for me. On others...it's just another OONTSOONTS-DUBSTEP-OONTS filled nightclub that's so packed its impossible to move and so loud its impossible to hear the person next to you. So. Take this review with the grain of salt that particular perspective offers. \\n\\nI would give it 2 stars on it's \\\"Club-lounge\\\" nights, and 5 on it's \\\"actual cocktail room\\\" nights.\\n\\nPros:\\n- I always get amazing cocktails here, and the bartenders know their stuff. Order off the menu, or tell them what you like and ask them to suggest something, either way, you can't go wrong. They are made with love, and great, fresh ingredients. \\n- On \\\"good\\\" nights, it's a great place to take an old friend who just flew into town, pull up a chair, and catch up over a cocktail (or four). It's quiet enough you can talk, loud enough you aren't overheard by the world, and the staff never gives you the \\\"GTFO\\\" stinkeye.\\n- These cocktails are actually worth $14. The prices are really not that bad for damn good cocktails made out of fancy pants ingredients. It's not the sort of stuff you can say, make at home, without dropping at LEAST $150 on all the necessary bottles. Unless you're ordering a gin and tonic or something, and that just sort of makes you an idiot. Be adventurous and order something with chartreuse.\\n- Atmosphere is cozy and mellow. Sort of like some rich old fella's study. Curl up in a chair with a smoky scotch drink and just say \\\"ahhhh.\\\"\\n\\nCons:\\n - Realizing you came on random nightclub night. Oontz.\n\nAnswer:",

We made a reservation about an hour in advance and were seated immediately.  The decor is nice - I liked the colors, the textures, and the distressed brick.  It has an upscale gastropub feel.  There are long high top tables in the middle of the restaurant that looked like they held multiple parties of people, but we were seated in a booth.  The booths were very private, which we really liked.\\n\\nWe got there at the tail end of happy hour, so we ordered our drinks and appetizers immediately.  We had the pork belly taco and the duck fat fries.  Both were excellent, and honestly if I had just ordered two tacos and the fries to myself it would have been the perfect meal.  I'll definitely return for the taco.\\n\\nFor dinner my husband had slow-cooked beef shoulder and I had the bacon-wrapped pork filet mignon.  My husband's meal was better.  Mine was fine, but the whole dish was just a little too sweet for my liking.  After the smoky, meaty pork belly taco, I was wanting something similar in taste.  I would get something different next time.  We also had the bananas foster beignets for dessert.  They were soooo good!  \\n\\nAll in all, I will definitely return to the Salty Sow.  It wasn't the best meal I've ever had in Phoenix, but it was still excellent - from ambiance, to service, to food - and I can't wait to come back and sample some more of the menu.\n\nAnswer:",

As it turned out in two of my three projects with them, I did need to buy more tile as my contractor miss calculated twice. \\n\\nThey are definitely not a big box store like Lowes, Home Depot, or Arizona Tile. Craftsman Court is unique, one of a kind tile, from all of the world. If you want to come home to the same tile that anyone can get from any big box store all over the country, then this probably isn't the place for you. But if you want something unique that separates from everyone else buying tile, this is the place for you.\n\nAnswer:",

We were greeted by our server, who immediately tried to push alcoholic drinks on us.  We came here at lunch time on a weekday, so I wasn't really in the mood to get hammered, but we did order some aguas frescas instead (Horchata and jamaica, it was either 5 or 6 dollars).  They were a hefty price, but it was served in a very large glass.  My horchata was OK, it had decent flavor and was fairly refreshing.  The jamaica was very concentrated, so if you like a lot of tangy hibiscus flavor this is the drink for you.  \\n\\nWe ended up ordering a variety of tacos, but not before our server tried to push some guacamole (Around $6) on us.  We didn't really want any at first, but she insisted that it was some of the best guacamole ever and was one of the best appetizers in the house.  Soo.... we begrudgingly accepted, since we wanted to see what the hype was about.  When we got the appetizer, it was in a tiny little bowl, and covered with pomegranate seeds.  It tasted OK, and was made with fresh ingredients, but I can honestly make fresh guacamole like this at home with bigger portions for way cheaper.  \\n\\nThe tacos were small, like street taco size.  They came on a single small corn tortilla, and were piled high with filling.  I would have liked to see them use 2 tortillas on top of each other for stability, because I couldn't really hold the tacos in my hand to eat them.  Because they were so full, and the ingredients were a bit juicy, they would fall off while the tortilla fell apart as soon as I picked it up.  Sadly, I had to actually eat most of the tacos with a fork and knife like a gringo.  I do appreciate the generous amount of filling that was in them though, but at taquerias I've been to they typically double the street taco tortillas for this very reason.  As for the ingredients themselves, they have some unusual ones here you won't find at other Mexican restaurants, which I appreciate, but on the whole I didn't find the tacos too great taste-wise.  I had some huitlacoche tacos, a first for me, but the whole kernels of fungus-infected corn popped in my mouth as I ate them with a gooey, mushy texture on the inside, with not much flavor.  It wasn't too pleasant of a experience taste and texture wise; I felt like I was eating a bunch of pus.  Perhaps if they were chopped into smaller pieces rather than whole kernels it would have tasted better, since a big kernel on a small taco can overwhelm the whole dish.\\n\\nAdditionally, our server was fairly attentive, as long as there was something for her to push on us.  But, when it came time to get the check, she was no where to be seen, and we had to wait a very long time before anyone came over to our table.  \\n\\nSo the mixture of very pushy service combined with tacos that were memorable in all the wrong ways make me hesitant to try this restaurant again when I can get really tasty Mexican food for way cheaper at other places in the East Valley.\n\nAnswer:",

With a long history in the food service industry, I am always sure to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt, but Bakersfield has swung very hard, come very close, and missed. \\n\\nI've had a taco before, believe it or not, and this particular taco was certainly above average. The problem here lies with the atmosphere and service. My party placed their orders... Actually... Screamed their orders over the music (which was cranked to 11). When the food finally arrived, it was presented on one large tray and left to us to decipher what was what and whose was whose. \\n\\nI didn't mind the food, but the margarita was pretty weak, and the overall experience lacked polish and enthusiasm.\\n\\nI wish I could say I'll be back, as the restaurant's concept and mission are something I look for in a dining experience. However, the overall experience was a huge letdown... My future Mexican outings will be to Paco's Tacos.\n\nAnswer:",

Located by desert breeze park which is way closer than serenade for me. \\n\\nThis Korean owned cafe is so unique. First off is their interior. When you walk in you get this antique roadshowish type of vibe. There are trinkets and accessories everywhere in the cafe. There are a variety of rad chairs, benches, and a couch. The jewel of this place is the Volkswagen tent up front. Inside the tent are 4 comfy bean bag chairs, a table, Christmas lights, and fake grass underneath you. You'd be lucky if it's empty! This place also has free wifi!\\n\\nWhen you order drinks you are given a pile of pictures to choose from as a stamp card. Another unique trait is that this cafe has a stamp card rack. You put your name on your stamp card and hang it under a letter of your choosing. After 7 stamps your next drink is free!\\n\\nTheir menu is also eye candy. Everything on their menu is under $9. The most expensive thing on there is snow ice for $8. Drinks range from $2-$5. They have plenty of coffees, teas, and cold drinks to choose from. I've tried the cold chai tea latte ($3) and the green tea frappe ($5). They both have strong flavors and that's what makes it taste great. You get the strong taste of matcha and the strong taste of chai. They both come in cute cups that look like they could be from urban outfitters. I'm willing to try the whole menu!\\n\\nThis is probably going to be my new hangout spot.\n\nAnswer:",

The entrance is a bit strange and when you first arrive its not very clear where you need to go to get the ticket written up,anyways found that. I decided on the 19.99 deal and with my 3 dollar yelp discount paid 16.99. first thing you notice is this place appears to have a lot of employees running around,what they are all doing is a mystery to me since the reason I came in was to get my car washed and that was done poorly ,I can only assume they are all running around stocking shelves,I mean this place is almost like a mini market,they are selling way more then just car washes here,which is really detracting from the quality of the wash itself. Part of my 19.99 (16.99) wash was scented air,to my surprise when i went in they handed me a scented tree to hang on my rear view mirror,WTF? this isn't 1982 and I don't drive an old beater,all the car washes i have ever been to that offer this is a package item actually spray the scent in the car,not  give you some cheesy tree to hang in the car,i tossed that shit away. when my car came out it sat out in the hot sun for at least 7-8 minutes,not under the shade which all the other cars were under,i was going to say something and then i noticed the person who was going to do my car,I told him as i usually do to the people who work on my car,I want special attention given to the wheels and tire dressing and pointed out a few trouble areas that I wanted him to address,he said no problem,I gave him the 5 bucks and when i started to drive out they had bent my side view mirrors in and when i popped them back out they were filthy,the windows were filthy the car was horrible,i was in a rush so I didnt have time to have him do it all again,I just will not return. i get better washes when they are free at the dealer. This place needs to focus on what kind of business they want to be and hire people who will reflect that vision,not slackers with no sense or sight. I would never reccomend this place to anyone unless they like to pay to have a half ass job done.\n\nAnswer:",

Took friends there for what turned out to be  a very disappointing meal. Over $100 for 4 adults (no alcohol, beverages or dessert and a shared appetizer) Biggest problem was poor quality of the entrees which were ALL dry and really over cooked. I could barely slice my lamb which was cooked down to cardboard and ended up leaving it uneaten on my plate. Some of the entrees were charred black - and not in a nice just-off-the-grill way - but they were sent out of the kitchen and merrily served to us without comment.  Did complain to the manager - but stressed i wasn't trying to get something for free. She brought us a small dessert with 4 forks which was nice but didn't exactly ease the memory of our poor quality meals. On the upside the hummus and stuffed grape leaves were good.  Still, I won't be back again.\n\nAnswer:",

Some leading into turn of the century meets Star Trek rooms, others, well...  Spaces morph, the experience evolves, life happens all around you.  Live bands, eclectic music, spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production, good food, great craft cocktails.  You need to experience it to understand.\\n\\nEssentially it's a craft cocktail ultra lounge, stage production, and mega club and restaurant all in one.\\n\\nBreaking it down:\\n\\nCraft Cocktails - Excellent, many reinvented, from classics.  Very consistent (a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients).\\n\\nStage Production (Vegas Nocturne) -  Similar to Absinthe.  Acrobatics, comedy, tap dancing, strip teases. No more details as you are sworn to secrecy.  \\n\\nClub - Still need to experience this.\\n\\nRestaurant - Inventive and indulgent.  Many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos (Yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar), deconstructed oysters Rockefeller (fried oysters on a bacon butter saut\\u00e9ed spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell) or the tete de cochon (deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg).\\n\\nFor larger dishes, the reinvented beef Wellington (beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie, trumpet mushrooms, studded with cream spinach, topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky, latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich.\\n\\nIncredible caviar service (five types sold by the ounce, half kilo, kilo).\\n\\nOutstanding wine and champagne list.  Ultra lounge prices.\\n\\nTip;  To make the most of your experience:\\n1.  Make a night of it.  Drinks, dinner, and the show.\\n2.  Move through the rooms.  There is something different in each.\\n3.  Make reservations if you want to eat a full meal.\\n4.  Purchase your tickets in advance for the show.  Don't skimp.  Pay the $135 for the best seats.\\n5.  Shows are not the same.  The later you go, the edgier.\\n6.  Be prepared to spend $$$$.  The show, dinner, and some cocktails averages $300 per person.

Step up your game, Caesars. Even Circus Circus has all their rooms fully renovated.\\n\\n2.

After working in customer service for more than seven years, I have a lot of empathy for the people who work behind the counter. I understand there are some bad days and some customers just ask for it, but what I got from the incompetent security guard was unacceptable and uncalled for. All I wanted to do was to pick up a binder that was left behind by my friend who had the room checked out to her. My friend spoke to the hotel manager about the situation prior to my arrival and he told her to let me know the procedure: Go to security - get housekeeping involved - get the binder.\\n\\nThis security guard made my life so much harder by playing games, asking who specifically stayed in the room even when I gave him the name of who the room was checked out to, saying the room wasn't checked out to her even though it WAS, playing with the pronunciation of names, making me walk all the way to the front desk even though he knew the power was in his hands to just call housekeeping up for the item, making up \\\"issues\\\" even though the hotel manager clearly said THOSE WEREN'T ISSUES to begin with.\\n\\nBasically, this guy just wanted to come off as if he knew everything and made up his own procedures to kill his boredom. I ultimately got the item after more than an hour of dealing with his incompetence and his need to go on a power trip.\\n\\n4.

I like my furniture sturdy, unbreakable. \\n\\nSo with that being said, why a 2 star here for this store in particular? The service! Actually the store manager truth be told. It's like the case of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Yes I dress pretty \\\"comfortable\\\" on weekends and I could be mistaken for a 15 year old without a job, but I am still a customer. A customer who just moved in a new house and needs to fill up his house slowly.  So when I frequently get snubbed for more affluent looking customers, I just  peruse the floor samples and get what I want at Pottery Barn Henderson or online. \\n\\nIn my profession, don't judge a book by it's cover. Treat everyone like family and they will treat you like family.\n\nAnswer:",

Stores were you can practically go and buy a robot slave to wash your dishes and get an artificial heart or something . And being somewhat of a nerd I love my electronics and was aghast when I relized there were not as many electronic stores in the UK as in the USA. Where would I get my parts for my super collider!!! well this little shop is about the closest I can come to , and you know what? Thats not all that bad at all. I can go in here and get a nice wide variety to choose from. They have a little bit of everything. Camera, camcorders, Apple products, printers, and tons of other stuff. Thank you for being in Edinburgh you cute little digital store and having lots of goodies. I need you so I can get my electronic fix on when I need to . I recommend this shop for you folks like me , its also a great little place to go wander and window shop!\n\nAnswer:",

The only downside to my dinner visit was that I was already sort of full from a late lunch, which meant I couldn't fit much into my belly :( Sad, I know.\\n\\nSo my bf and I came here Friday night for dinner and it was pretty crowded. Not too too crowded where you have to wait your turn to get food or when the food runs out and you have to wait for it to be replaced. I've been to the Hokkaido in Long Beach, CA and this was pretty similar to that one. They had a pretty good selection of sushi and sashimi (salmon, octopus, and something else I forget). There was lots of steamed crab legs that never ran out and some pretty (unusually) huge cooked clams. See my photo. They were huge! The food was good and the buffet was clean. However, the service was spectacular! The waitresses were extremely nice and always had a smile on their face, which was a pleasant change from the typical Asian buffets where the waitresses seam to dislike taking the plates off your table.\\n\\nDessert selection okay. I did like how they had about 8 different ice cream self-serve flavors. The other desserts didn't really stand out to me. The only downside to the dessert section was the chocolate fountain. The bottom level... um... seemed murky (kinda like the dirty water that gets caught in the side of a lake) and definitely needed to be changed.

After reading about it, me and the boys decided we had to try the Chicken Fried Lobster. What's the worse that could happen? Well to answer that, no seasoning. This was a nice piece of 8 ounce lobster pan fried in bread crumbs, no salt, no pepper, no garlic, no basil, nothing (at least you can't taste any seasoning). They serve it with warm drawn butter and a horrible orange colored sauce. When you think Chicken Fried you think of big flavor and this missed the mark. This could be a great dish, but it just isn't here. I sprinkled salt and pepper on it, but it only helped a little. The sauce they serve with it is bad. I did get an awesome loaded baked potato, but that's not what I came for. Lobster bisques (decent, but needed more lobster), salads, and the entr\\u00e9es, were about $250 before tip (no wine).

Everyone will tell you how great this place is until one day you walk into their shiny establishment in Centennial Hills. About 30 minutes later you will realize that all of your friends actually hate you for suggesting that you dine here.\\n\\nAll the service people are nice but in a really vacant Stepford wife kind of way. It's all lip service and no actual service. For example, our server was super interested in up-selling fancy beer to me... so we had to have a really long discussion about why I should try another kind of beer as opposed to the one I wanted. Once \\\"we\\\" decided that I would stick to drinking what I want, we must have also decided that the table would wait for 20 minutes before said drinks would be delivered. \\n\\nIf you've ever read 1984 you will know that questions are also pretty unacceptable. I wish I had known that it was a 1984 concept restaurant before I asked about vegetarian options on the menu! I had planned on ordering some pasta or something, but it turns out that all the pastas and salads include meat and are priced accordingly. One question about that and she was off for another several minutes.\\n\\nAnd the fun didn't even end there! I ordered soup and salad as my entree and both the soup and the salad were delivered to the table at the same time several minutes before anyone else was served. But I guess they did not consider this a problem since there was no silverware. So it's not like I was going to eat it before the rest of my party's food arrived, anyway NO BIG DEAL GUYS!\\n\\nAnd so I stared at my food until the rest of the party got their food delivered, too. And still there was no silverware. The random hostess that delivered the food nicely asked if we needed anything else and when we asked for silverware, she walked away. Then we all got to stare at our food TOGETHER!\\n\\nWhen we finally did get some silverware, I ate my Denny's quality food while feeling angry about the empty service and impending bill. This place is really Applebee's quality with Cheesecake Factory prices. My throat almost closed when I saw that the $12 avocado roll appetizer was actually only THREE avocado spring rolls. Not that it mattered since we never got appetizer plates even though we were asked if we wanted some when the appetizer was delivered. (Here is a tip: probably you should just bring appetizer plates instead of asking if the table would like some and then never bringing them causing another \\\"lets all stare at this food\\\" situation.)\\n\\nTry eating a whole meal with an anger lump in your throat. It really takes the enjoyment out of eating. BJ's was a big fat $60 disappointment that ruined the pleasant experience that eating usually provides to me. That is a big deal considering that is why restaurants even exist.\\n\\nNote to the management: I think that I would have given this experience 3 stars had the server or staff, who KNEW that this was a messed up dining experience for a number of reasons, had even tried to rectify the situation or notified the manager that the meal had been timed and executed very badly. But no one wanted to fix it and that enrages me more than anything else.\\n\\nVegetarian Side note: I didn't try the pizza even though it is supposedly really good for vegetarians, but be warned unless you want pizza, you probably won't find anything else on the menu that you want. All the pastas and salads include meat, and I don't see the point in paying $16 for a salad and then asking that they remove the most expensive ingredient. They have a veggie burger which is your standard garden burger replacement. And it was soggy. \\n\\nI will never go back to BJ's. It is over-priced and overhyped. If anyone I know ever tells me how great this place is again I will drop kick them so hard that they will need a kidney transplant in their face.\n\nAnswer:",

We decided to try a variety of items since it was fresh and available but we were unable to take more than a single bite of any of it.\\n\\nIf the service and lunch quality was on par with the price of the buffet, this place would receive 4-5 stars from me.\n\nAnswer:",

The location is not great as it is in North Scottsdale and is therefore a long way from downtown Phoenix or even downtown Scottsdale. We made reservations for 6:30 p.m. on  Friday night and so they had a booth ready for us when we arrived a few minutes early. The waiter (Tomas) was very attentive and polite and had water then drinks on the table very quickly. Because we checked in as Yelpers we were given a special coupon (on our phone) for a free appetizer (the lettuce wraps-yum). After we had finished our appetizer, the waiter asked if he could see our coupon again so he could show it to his manager. As we had already clicked \\\"Use it Now\\\" we could not show it to him so he borrowed our phone and showed the manager that we really did have a Yelp account and so we were given the special deal (did the manager not know about the coupon?). For our main course we had the Bamboo Beijing Duck and the Pad Thai Rice Noodles. Both were very tasty, but not the tastiest (4 star). I think that the dipping sauce for both the lettuce wraps and the duck came straight out of a bottle and was not a prepared sauce. If the Bamboo Club wants to compete with P.F. Chang's then it may want to upgrade its dipping sauce presentation. Overall a very pleasant dining experience, however, if you are staying in Phoenix, it is at least a 30-minute drive to get here so plan your time accordingly.\n\nAnswer:",

Sure, the place still has terrific views but that's it.  The tables and chairs are rickety and aren't cleaned often, as using my hand to pull my own chair in found at least two used pieces of gum affixed to the underside.  \\n\\nMy wife and I quickly ordered macaroni and cheese for our two year old son while we looked over our menu options.  The mac and cheese arrived within two minutes - clearly it's made en masse - but was overcooked and lacked any discernible flavor.  This should have been all the warning we needed, but instead we forged ahead and ordered the \\\"Cowboy Stuff\\\" platter for two.  At $21.95 per person it seemed like a good value for all it promised; BBQ chicken and ribs, skewers of beef, chicken, and seafood, baked potatoes, corn, the works.  What was delivered was a baking sheet with all the aforementioned food loaded onto it, but with whole carrots with the green stems still on, celery stalks with leaves on it, and so on.  It looked like someone had been foraging in the woods for our dinner.   It was accompanied by a very forgettable salad that had tons of dressing, yet lacked flavor of any kind.  \\n\\nThen came the taste test of our main course.  The name of this restaurant really should be \\\"Overcooked and Flavorless\\\" because the trend started with our son's unfortunate kid's meal was consistent across the entire meal.  \\n\\nMy son needed to use the restroom, so we headed off in that direction.  The baby changing station isn't even in the bathroom, but affixed to a wall out in the hall for all to see.  Walking into the bathroom, we took one look at the dirty, dank surroundings and immediately headed the other direction.  We'll wait, thanks.  \\n\\nGetting back to the table and trying my food, I decided to ask for the manager to voice my concerns.  Unbeknownst to me, my wife had already spoken with him.  When he arrived, he seemed exasperated and told me, \\\"I already told her I'd replace the meal with something else and she said no.  What else do you want?\\\"   Um, well NOTHING now, pal.  So sorry to be an interruption to your evening of overcooking and underseasoning everything.  \\n\\nWe won't be back again.  Ever.\n\nAnswer:",

But I feel if I don't I would be doing a disservice to all Charlotte Yelpers who may find themselves in the same horrible, horrible, dining experience I had this afternoon.\\n\\nI used to LOVE this place. I used to suggest it to all my friends, raving about the great NY style pizza, great atmosphere, and great service. Today I feel like I ate at a completely different restaurant. \\n\\nHostess was very sweet, cleaning off a table for us outside. We were sat, and then we sat. and sat. and sat. No one came over to even acknowledge us. After finally tracking down our waitress, we placed our drink orders and and ordered Mozz sticks app. About 10 min went by. Then 15, and I started wondering if they were brewing my beer behind the bar. As i sat there waiting for our drinks for about 20 min, I started noticing a few weird things about our waitress \\\"New Lisa\\\" as it said on our receipt. She was honestly acting like she had taken something the night before, or that morning who knows, and it was still in her system for sure. Seemed like she was just wandering around lost, every table she had was constantly asking for refills, their check, etc.... There was something way more wrong there than her just being \\\"new\\\". \\n\\nWhen our food finally made it, she couldn't even remember who had ordered what out of all 2 OF US AT THE TABLE. And to top it all off the food was disgusting. Mozz sticks were obviously frozen,sauce had no flavor. I got chick parm stromboli, it came out soggy, somewhat cold, and just gross. My wife got the meat ravioli, she said they were ok, probably frozen as well,but the sauce they were buried in was pretty unbearable. I remember fresh ingredients from this place, no more.....\\n\\nI don't know if something major has gone on here in the past 6 months or so, but I will never be back after this experience. When you have 2 full plates of food left sitting on the table, I literally took 2 bites, and no one says anything it speaks miles about the apathy of this restaurant., staff, & ownership.\\n\\nKnowing its the same ownership group of  some other local favorites of mine, I will not be supporting any of their food until the issues are addressed and big changes are made. I will make sure everyone I know who has eaten at this restaurant is well aware of the type of service and food this establishment offers.\\n\\nExcuse me while I morn the loss of one of my favorites.\n\nAnswer:",

Looking at it you don't think much but the proof is in the pudding right?? Precisely! Saucemans seems to have a lists of accolades and after reading these reviews on here and tasting a small sample at taste of charlotte I was really looking forward to having a full meal. I had the 2 meat sampler with Mac and White Coleslaw . my lady had the smoked turkey! I was really impressed with mine. The ribs were charred, smoked and covered in one of the nest sauces I've ever tasted. Only having a sampler I was disappointed at the fact I didn't have more of them to eat. I did however have the Brisket. Again this was an excellent cut of meat smoked to perfection, it was melt in your mouth soft and when you combined it with the sides was almost perfect. Texas toast was great, Mac n cheese was great and I'm not even a real fan of coleslaw but that was great too! Now if only this place was in a better building it would probably be the best BBQ in the state -easily. It already ranks on top for the taste but if it offered that actual restaurant experience instead of that lunch room/quickbite feel it has it would be on a whole other level\\n \\nI look forward to going back soon for a full rack of ribs - it will be glorious\n\nAnswer:",

I have frequented this bar/restaurant in the past merely for their atmosphere, pretty scenery and great patio; however, more than a few times the service has been downright unprofessional and staff rude from time to time. \\n\\nI was recently in the restaurant with a fairly large party and we all ended up with food poisoning from the hummus and baba ganoush. I wasn't so upset that it happened because it's a risk one takes but what happened after I will never forget. After nicely calling the manager Pam, I only wanted to inform her of what had happened so that others would not get sick and she quickly became defensive and told me that it was impossible we could get sick on hummus. Sadly but true in my opinion she must have never taken a food safety class. As most of us know bacteria can grow in protein and hummus is all protein. She argued me and I quickly responded with the fact that eight people getting sick is no coincidence. As a manager in the past, it's right to sympathize with the customer, not defend. I wanted nothing from her but she quickly told me she would tell the chef and \\\"sorry, hope you feel better\\\", and she hung up the phone. This tells me the Vig's management is not only unprofessional but downright awful. \\n\\nI never thought their food was that great anyway and it's a step up from bar food but if you want drink menus tossed at your table, long waits before being greeted, rude staff and food poisoning, then check out the Vig. If you don't want to park in valet, be careful parking in the check cashing parking lot because it can be dangerous crossing that busy street.\n\nAnswer:",

They were not that busy but had severabl people waiting outside and empty tables inside.  The check in person asked for a cell phone to text us when the table was ready, yet called out names for others.  People that came after us were seated before us since we did not have our cell phone in hand to know they text us and called names for others. When we were going to be seated outside and asked if we could take one of the EMPTY tables under the umbrella, we were told they were not being waited on.  We asked for an EMPTY table in the corner that was BETWEEN 2 tables that had patrons at (would assume the waitress that was serving those tables could serve the EMPTY table) but were told we would have to wait 5 minutes before they could assing a waitress to our table.  We asked if we could wait while sitting at the EMPTY table.  That bothered the hostess but she allowed us to sit there.  And...YES... we waited... longer than 5 minutes as waitresses passed up our table to wait on the tables around us.  After ordering, the coffee took forever to come--- in paper cups because they ran out of actual coffee cups...with a LESS than packed house....guess that means if they are full at breakfast time...EXPECT TO GET YOUR COFFEE IN PAPER CUPS. The food was delivered...3 of the 4 of us had food.  I tasted my food while we waited...it was COLD.  The food would have been good if it has at least been warm.\\nCustomer service of check in and seating, service at the table, food prep and delivery all need attention.\n\nAnswer:",

These places have a much better selection of toppings (my 2 favorites - brie cheese and cinnamon bacon were missing at BLT!). \\n\\nHowever, I do love BLT for the sheer variety of \\\"pre-designed\\\" burgers. Lamb burgers? Ban-mi burgers? Crazy I tell you. I had the kobe slider trio cooked medium rare - 1 was BBQ, 1 was BLT and 1 was Blue cheese. All rocked!

In my previous review i wrote one thing that i didn't think i would get to touch base on again, but guess what coincidences happened and it just so happened to be a coincidence that i was in the same room that we gave birth to our first child in. I thought it was a good thing at first to be able to make memories in the same room with our new child until i remembered what i had written after being in the room for roughly 20 minutes and i quote\\\"engineering to come to the room to check the hot water and a leak in the shower head well i think I'm going to check out and i don't think these issues will get addressed.\\\" Well the hot water issue in room 270 in labor in delivery has not gotten addressed and its been over a year it has been such a common thing that when i brought it to our new nurses attention Laurel she simply stated that they were aware that the hot water didn't get hot in that room fast enough and that there work around was to use the hot water in the sink in the room itself and not the sink in the bathroom perhaps these nurses have forgotten what it was like to be giving birth but being embarrassed by having to have a door open while your husband tries to get you a hot washcloth for you to wash off is not the ideal solution and the fact that it has not been addressed in over a year is just baffling and not only does the hot water take a long time the water also backs up when you're trying to take a shower. SO PRAY THAT YOU DON'T GET ROOM 270 \\n\\nMy encounter with the nurses this time was a bit more pleasant although we did have moments of mis-communication the main nurse that we dealt with tried to make things right as much as possible but sometimes she did fail. Laurel was the name of our main nurse and overall she was ok except for the fact that I felt like she lacked a bit of empathy. Allow me to elaborate my wife and I arrived to the hospital around 8:00 am it was a Saturday and the hospital seemed a bit empty there was boxes that were littering the main entrance and they had not been covered by anything later in the day they were covered with sheets although they were a real big eye sore. When we arrived Laurel greeted us and took us to our room which seemed very familiar to me we had some small talk and she checked my wife she put in some bill to soften up the walls they said and then we waited my wife started having really bad contractions and so the nurse was called my wife was on the edge about getting or wanting an epidural she wanted to try natural birth so the nurse gave my wife some medication that ended up knocking her out and when she came to she was in extreme pain the anesthesiologist was called to do the epidural my wife was screaming from so much pain and Laurel came in said the anesthesiologist is here so we need you to sit up she did so but all of a sudden here screams became louder and seemed more painful it was to the point where we didn't know what or who was hurting her the anesthesiologist asked if it was him all of a sudden between the screams my wife blurred out i can feel his head i think I'm having the baby the anesthesiologist had not put the epidural in yet and he himself stopped and said I have not done anything if you would like we can check her well laurel being the helpful nurse she is decides that no its more important for him to get the epidural in, instead if asking my wife she just tells the anesthesiologist to proceed he continues and my wife continues to scream  the anesthesiologist finally gets the needle in and my wife sits back well guess what the child is crowning and he was coming out just like my wife had said If laurel would have taken the time to let my wife make the decision instead of her then my wife would've never had to get the epidural since the baby was already crowning at this point the anesthesiologist is nervous and starts to hit my wife with what i though was called boost but i believe i was later corrected to it being called a bolus dose this in turn made it hard for my wife to push because she all of a sudden became numb from the waist down and then it started to work its way up to her shoulders but the time the baby was out my wife was fully drugged up and could barely hold our baby I feel like these drugs where administered incorrectly because instead of it helping the the birth she literally just sat up barely holding onto consciousness.\n\nAnswer:",

The lady on the other end assured me that the shuttle was on its way as she claimed she spoke with the driver who said he was \\\"wrapping around the airport and would be right there.\\\" Well, another 10 minutes later, I called again wondering if the driver had gotten lost, disoriented, in a car accident, or blatantly lied, and again I was reassured the shuttle was on its way and that it should be there any second since their location was literally 5 minutes away from the airport (not sure why it would take so long to get to the airport when you're only 5 minutes away.)\\n\\nLong story short (kinda), the shuttle FINALLY appeared after 5 phone calls and waiting for over an hour in the freezing cold (this is when there was the huge snow/winter storm). The driver pulls up in an unmarked van (no Sixt logo), and proceeds to just sit in the car, not saying he's with Sixt, not saying anything... Just hanging out in the car, when at this point, there were 4 of us waiting for this \\\"shuttle\\\". One of the gentleman that was waiting with us went up to the van and asked the driver if this was indeed the Sixt shuttle, to which the driver responded yes. We got in the van and literally a 5 minute ride later, we were at the office. Mind you, there were no signs with the name, no logo, nothing. We literally got out in a parking lot that looked almost deserted, other than cars parked there. We entered into a small building and lo-and-behold FINALLY saw a Sixt logo. \\n\\nThe lady at the front desk was really nice and said she was going to upgrade us since we had to wait so long for the shuttle to come pick us up, which was definitely nice. The car, however, wasn't THAT great. I mean the car itself was a brand new Nissan Ultima so I couldn't really complain much about that... but the smell in the car?! Someone definitely was smoking like a chimney in there -- the smoke smell was so incredibly strong I had to drive with the windows down and the heat blasting so I could at least stand being in the car. Not to mention I opened the arm rest compartment to plug my phone in to charge, and a huge cloud of weed odor came out, so it was back to windows being opened. \\n\\nI think it's safe to say that I will NEVER EVER book another rental vehicle with Sixt, nor will I ever recommend them to anyone. I guess that's why they're \\\"Sixt\\\" -- because they suck!!!\n\nAnswer:",

We arrived before they got busy, so our lack of reservation wasn't an issue and we were seated immediately. Seriously impressive wine menu; their website's claim to \\\"wine bible\\\" was justified. The bruschetta was nothing to write home about, their mushroom pan fry was tasty, but had a bit too much filler. The meat on the \\\"Smoke, Sugar, Shank\\\" was cooked perfectly, but the beans were cold and tasteless and the whateverelse it came with wasn't memorable. The highlight of the night was definitely the desserts. The birthday cake of the night was a dark chocolate raspberry affair, and the taste was divine, even if the seeds added to an unusual texture. We sampled the ice cream trio with Orange Blossom, Chocolate Chunk, and Pickled Watermelon, and were extremely pleased. Three scoops of ice cream on a plate didn't seem enough to justify a $10 price tag, but with places like this it's to be expected. The desert wine was lovely after they filtered the cork out of my first glass. All in all a good meal, punctuated by occasional disappointment.\n\nAnswer:",

They won't take it. So yeah, I've had it forever and always forgot to bring it with me but that's beside the point - it says \\\"NO EXPIRATION\\\"!!! So starting off on the wrong foot, we stood in the doorway for a while until I chased down a waitress to ask where we could sit. The patio and bar were full and only one table was available inside. We sat and were quickly attended to by a great server (Eddie) who was obviously super busy but never once ignored us. The food was so-so; I remember it being better in the past when this place was not nearly as busy. The calamari was a bit soggy but decent tasting and the rock shrimp tempura was slightly soggy as well but OUT OF THIS WORLD in flavor! All of the sushi rolls on the special menu were either deep fried or covered in spicy mayo. You think I kid; I don't. And honestly, something tasted off, not super fishy but like the Hamachi had been previously frozen for a month and wasn't fresh? Unfortunately Tammy wasn't behind the bar so I didn't stop to piss and moan and make a scene but had she been there and had a moment to chat (like she has in the past) I probably would have said something. Even though I really want to give this place 1 star for tonight's several moments of WTF, Eddie was a killer attentive server, the food was expeditiously prepared, I think Tammy is a cool chick, and the all-day happy hour and sushi costs can't be beat anywhere in this state.

And I'll say it...I'm glad I didn't cross the Birmingham Bridge just  for this.  Still, something about it is charming and authentic and well, original.  And the food wasn't allll bad.  \\n\\nFirst the good:  The fries were plentiful and amazing.  I realize they probably never change the frying oil but I'm sure that's exactly what makes them so tasty.  And the gravy...get the gravy!!  It elevates the fry experience to a whole new level.   Also tried these fries with cheese; plain ol' ketchup; and bare naked.  Delicious any way you go.  \\n\\nThe disgusting: The hot dog.  I'm sorry but I don't get the hype.  I like my hot dogs plump, juicy and preferably all-beef.  This was shriveled, crunchy, crusty, overcooked, and well...I don't know what's in a hot dog but it wasn't all beef.  I realized after ordering that you can in fact order an all-beef dog, but that leads me to the next point....\\n\\nThe confusing:  I know this is part of the charm and what makes this place an \\\"institution\\\" in Pittsburgh and a gripe from a newcomer is worth about a penny, but wow.  The menu is super busy and all over the place...leading me to miss the all-beef dog option. And I had absolutely no idea where to physically place my order (dogs in one section, fries in another, beer/pizza in another!!!).  Fortunately it was mid afternoon, not too crowded, and a polite kid behind the counter had a surprising amount of patience with me.  \\n\\nIf for no other reason than a six pack of beer, I'm sure I'll be back at some point during my time as a part-time Pitt student.\n\nAnswer:",

I wanted to pay the extra $5 for the callous scrub but the owner said that it would be a waste of money since my feet only really needed the regular scrub. I felt she was sincere and didn't try to up-sell me. The regular price for a spa mani pedi is $50 but they also carry package deals. I will never get a mani pedi at the hotels cause a pedi alone can be $85...damn! I don't have sewer feet so not sure why anyone would pay that lol.

It was not to crowded for a Friday night which we were very surprised when most restaurants are hopping. There were bread stick on the table already but they were prepackaged ones and not from Italy, they were made in New Jersey. \\n\\nWe wanted the best from Buddy so my wife ordered his wife's linguine and clam sauce. While I had Buddy's chicken rigatoni \\\"ALLA VODKA\\\". My wife's meal was plain and not worth the $26 that they charged for it. It tasted like my wife made it herself nothing fancy or fantastic taste. Mine had maybe 6 pieces of chicken in it and the pasta was kind of chewy. It was like my wife made it also. Not saying I wouldn't eat it but not real fine dining. We have been to several restaurants in Vegas since we go 4-6 times a year. So I'm no newbie. \\n\\nOh I missed the garlic bread we ordered before the meal. Which consisted of three pieces for 9. Nothing special and little over priced again. My wife and I agreed Buddy should of opened a caf\\u00e9 type restaurant and not fine dining. The food is more family food but over priced for Vegas. It would be totally packed everyday if the prices were lower and family orientated. \\n\\nBut not to jam on Buddy over his place.

We both ordered a curry dish, and although it wasn't bad, it wasn't nearly the best i've had either. The most disappointing thing was that they brought us a salad with our lunch \\\"specials\\\", and didn't even ask what kind of dressing we wanted. It came with a catalina style dressing that we really disliked, and so that was a total waste of two otherwise nice looking side salads. So for $8+, we ended up with just some curry, a small side of rice, and a very small roll...not exactly a deal. The food was ok, but the service wasn't very friendly. the portions were not impressive. We will stick with THAI BASIL, as their food is much tastier, and their prices are more reasonable as well.\n\nAnswer:",

I came in with HIGH expectations and every one of them were met. Whether or not you are a Ramsay fan, this place is a must try for the best service and burgers.\\n\\nWait:\\nYes, there will always be a line. Each time I walked by at all hours of operations, I saw a line.\\nMy visit was on a Saturday for lunch. 10:45am Saturday = no line. 11am (opening) = 30 people in line. Since we were the first group to enter, line died down really fast. However, expect a line if you go during any main meal times.\\n\\nService: \\nAfter being seated, we were presented with an IPad for the drink menu. Very easy to navigate and modern. Our server(s) (they apparently have a \\\"backup\\\" server as well) were all attentive and friendly. Great service.\\n\\nTiming:\\nIf you watch Hell's Kitchen or Master Chef, you know Ramsay is all about timing and putting out delicious food without making the guests wait. I have to say, the timing of the drinks to appetizer to entree was perfect. \\n\\nFood:\\nSince it was my first time, had to order the Hell's Kitchen burger -Medium Well. Let tell you.. from the top bun to the bottom, pure perfection. The buns were super soft yet maintained it's form from the crisp outside, the bottom bun was not soggy, and all the ingredients worked really well. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had.\\n\\nJalapeno Poppers - what a clever way to present it. Not that having a main dipping bowl to dip your poppers is hard work but the individual shot glasses containing sauce and the popper makes it... easier and more enjoyable. Hands down, the freshest jalapeno poppers I've had. \\n\\nFries with Truffle oil. If you are dining with someone else, 2 burgers and one order of fries is plenty for both. I saw some people order a side of fries per person and none of them left finishing the fries off. What can I say... fries.. truffle oil.. yum yum yum.\\n\\nGreat service, great food, VERY reasonable price (TR members get $1 off each item), this is definitely a must try if you are on the strip.\\n\\nGO GO GO GO GO!\n\nAnswer:",

The lighting was suitably dim, but not too dark to read a menu. Overall, very cozy atmosphere. The service was impeccable- we never felt hovered over, but our waters stayed full and every need was anticipated. As for the food, \\nthere was not a bad bite on a plate. The bread was delicious, served with a side of fresh ricotta and olive oil. For appetizers, we ordered the artichokes and calamari. The artichokes were so tender and creamy. The calamari, fresh and in a phenomenal sauce with capers and olives. For entrees, we had the mushroom gnocchi in truffle oil and artichoke rigatoni. Both were savory and large servings- we had plenty to take home.  I almost hope that no one reads this review- the service and food was so good that I want to keep it to myself.\n\nAnswer:",

Here is my original review!\\nWent to the one in Ceasars forum shops, great service when your in the store but it ends the second you walk out the door. Bought a pair of Frankie B jeans and when i was packing to leave Vegas the next day found the security tag was still on them (which shocked me as i walked out the store and in 3 other stores without any alarms going off) tried to call the store and left multiple messages since no one seems to answer the phone EVER there. Didnt get a call back until 2 days later after i was already back in Chicago. I didnt even get an apology, was just oh well find someone to take it off, found a store here that would take it off and discovered the nasty hole left in the jeans... mind you these are 165 dollar jeans that now have a hole in them. Will never shop there again!\n\nAnswer:",

It was our first time so we asked Felipe, the employee up front, a few questions. He was short and not very friendly with his responses. We decided on our favorite, pepperoni and pineapple, on their double crust. Felipe described it similar to Dominos. I should have walked out the door then because I don't like Dominos pizza. The menu says double crust is a little thicker than the thin crust. We found a coupon online for a free pasta so we added a spaghetti to the order. We paid and he said it would be ready in 20-25 minutes.  As I was sitting in the lobby, I could see a small tv on a table in the back kitchen area. An employee walked over and turned the tv, made me question how sanitary it was back there. After tasting our pizza, I would compare it to a frozen pizza from the grocery. I was so disappointed. I really did not like their sauce. It was thick, clumped in various places of the pizza and weird tasting. The crust was dense and flavorless. The cheese was fine but they could have been more generous with the toppings. My husband hasn't tried the spaghetti yet, but I won't be trying it as I'm sure the sauce is the same as the pizza sauce. I won't go back there. If I want mediocre pizza, I can go to Little caesars for 1/3 of the price.\n\nAnswer:",

They offer name brand and designer clothing at pricing much below standard retail and I love shopping here because there are usually good deals to be found, especially in the clearance section if you can find your size. Notable features of this store include a large shoe and home selection, as well as plenty of cell phone accessories, and in the men's section there are a decent selection of suits, dress shirts and ties. There was a pretty decent line going at the register when I walked in but it was gone by the time I was ready to check out, so the employees here are pretty efficient.

My husband, son and I went Sunday 2pm. The place was packed and we had a short wait. We were very excited to see the place packed translating to a good restaurant and seeing the food being served to other patrons looked delicious. Unfortunately, my $15.99 seafood bouillabaise was terrible because it had 2 small/medium size shrimps, 4 frozen (not fresh) mussels, 2 tiny pieces of fish, 2 small rings (size of nickel and dime) of calamari, 3 crab legs the length and width of my fingers that was fully intacted in the shell (with no means of cracking the legs open). It came in a deceiving big bowl only to have me fish around in the sauce for the seafood. Why do they even bother having this on the menu only to serve frozen mussels and teeny tiny seafood? My husband ordered a cup of coffee which was luke warm he says. He hailed the waiter over and the waiter did remedy this by getting my husband a hotter cup of coffee. I was also excited to try the crispy pork from my husband's plate only to find it really hard to chew. Way over cooked/fried. The place was packed with Colombians so I would think its authentic and good. Don't go by my 1 star and not try this place, just don't order the seafood bouillibaise. Or maybe they just want to serve to Colombians? I'm fine with that. Its too bad we didn't have a good experience cause we are the type that would patronize a restaurant every week if we love it. Other restaurants would be glad to take my money once a week I'm sure.\n\nAnswer:",

We lived in separate homes for almost two months to accommodate the move!! The animal feces was atrocious! The lack of maintenance was ridiculous. The rent payments took weeks to be deducted from our accounts. We were repeatedly told lies.\\nWe \\\"purchased\\\" a parking spot. We specifically asked if we could park a trailer in the spot, because our previous apartment we knew that was a big no no.

My car got towed one night for no good reason! Luckily, they refunded me the tow fees, but seriously?! Upstairs neighbors never went to sleep. Farming stench? Ugh! I was so excited to go home back to Scottsdale!! And to top it off, we got charged some ridiculous fees when we moved out. My mom went through the apartment with a fine tooth comb and I mean she went a little ape *#%$ cleaning. And they came up with a bunch of bogus charges. Carpet cleaning? Seriously?

The room still had trash and glassware from the previous occupants and the requested call from the management never came.

As with Roka Akor, this place had great style in the decor, but the food just was not very good.  We ordered chicken tikka masala and a curry.  Both of the sauces were flavorful and balanced, but none of the flavors penetrated the meats in the curries.  It almost tasted like the curry was cooked in one pot, the meat was boiled in water and the meat was dropped into the curry at the last minute.  Maybe its the old school in me, but its such a waste to order a meat dish and leave the meat behind.  The search continues for good Indian food in my hood...\n\nAnswer:",

BBQ grills available for use\\n-- Exercise room\\n-- Free shuttle\\n-- Paid wireless $10 - $30 (I forget the exact price for how much)\\n\\nOK, so this place isn't the \\\"gem of Las Vegas.\\\" Let's just put that out there! For what it is, it's actually a decent place. My Grammie got me a 2 bedroom suite for a week for under $400. If you can find a place to sleep 6 - 10 people for that amount, let me know! And if it's in old town Las Vegas, no thank you. You can see the sign as you drive down Tropicana, just hang a left and there it is on the left side.\\n\\nSo let's talk about service. The front desk was very friendly, let us check in a little bit early. And took care of anything we needed but let me tell you I've done Las Vegas more than a few times, so my group didn't need much. Housekeeping happens like after a few days so we checked in Tuesday and got our rooms cleaned on Friday/Saturday. In addition to cleaning our rooms, we received plenty of towels, blankets, pillows on demand.\\n\\nThe room was decent. It's not the Ritz Carlton by no means. My GF & I shared the single jr suite room. It had a decent size closet, dresser, & bathroom. The bathroom was cool, nothing special. The shower did have a nice size bathtub so you could take a relaxing bath. Our toilet clogged up but they sent someone right up and it was good for the rest of the week. The bed was pretty comfortable, pillows and blankets better than a cheap motel. The AC worked awesome and kept both of the rooms very cool. It was nice to have a mini kitchen with a fridge for our stuff and a sink. We also had cups and plates. I was pretty pleased with the room in general.\\n\\nOur friends shared the adjointed room next door. It had almost a full kitchen with oven and microwave, a dining table plus sofa sleeper. The balcony patio was cool but it faced the road instead of the pool. The full size fridge came in handy for supplies and food. Oh yeah, washer and dryer plus complimentary laundry soap! We all did some laundry!\\n\\nThe pool was NOT very clean. The hot tub had a whole crap load of leaves in there. I wasn't impressed with the pool but the 24 hours was nice. We didn't really take advantage of it though.\\n\\nThe exercise room was decent. It had a stationary bike, treadmill and stairmaster (I think). It also had a full body work out machine that you could do all the basic exercises with weights. They do stock towels there for you and your sweat which was nice.\\n\\nHonestly since I had a rental car, the distance from the strip was just fine. If I wanted to do Las Vegas on the strip with no rental car, I wouldn't stay here. My friends used the shuttle and you're not getting anywhere fast on that thing. In addition it takes a while to get from point A to point B. \\n\\nAll in all I would rate this place at around 3.5 stars. It's better than an average motel and it's pretty cheap and decent! I will say that I didn't really hear any neighbors or anything but I wasn't in my room from 7pm to 7am, lol. I was in Las Vegas for the Electronic Daisy Carnival!\n\nAnswer:",

Went for haircuts nearby and my 10 year old decided to give Jewish deli a try. While we loved the food, the service was awful. Got the early bird special of a corned beef ruben (they split it in the kitchen for us) and I asked to add a bowl of soup (the early bird menu states it is $1.95 to add soup or salad). I asked if the matzo ball soup was available for that. Ended up being charged full price ($4.50) because the server didn't \\\"understand\\\" me. Shared the blintzes for dessert. Yum!\\nAll the savory items needed seasoning, but in our area (many seniors) most places under salt. This was no exception. No problem, there is salt on the table. My 10 year old is now a covert to Matzo ball soup!\\nOur server ignored us most of the time. We sat with our menus closed in front of us for over 10 minutes. Our server only had 1 other table. I paid $2.50 for an iced tea that was never refilled. When our bill turned up wrong, it took me almost 10 minutes to get her attention as she never looked over to our table. Then she ARGUED with me about it. It was my first time there and I knew more about the menu than she did! Finally she said she would pay the difference out of her own pocket. That's a nice way of saying she didn't want to get caught making a mistake. I asked for the manager.\\nI am generally a really good tipper. I've been a server and/or server trainer for most of my life.

My wife ordered the street tacos and for $20 they brought out a few tiny tacos that didn't compare to a local taco shop that would give you 20 of them that were bigger, better, and full of flavor for the same price.

While most have my massages have been good and some of them great and only a few not so good the customer service I have received at all of them has been exceptional.\\n\\nEvery massage I have booked over the years has been a 90 minute massage and every time I call to book one thats what they book me. Recently Massage Envy has started a promo that if you book an 8am massage you get a discount or something. So when I book at 8am I get my 90 minute for cheaper or at some locations for the price of just 60 minutes. This is amazing, but not why I book a 90 minute massage as I have been doing so for many years before they started this promo. This is where my problem started with this location and maybe the most ridiculous front desk girl who should be working at a toll booth when it comes to common sense skills much less customer service. \\n\\nI have probably booked 15 massages at this location in the last 3 months. Most likely more then there average customer. This girl started booking me for only 1 hour in the mornings instead of my usual 90 minutes. When I asked her why she said I did not specify that I wanted a 90 minute. I then stated Every massage I book has always been for 90 and isn't that obvious from my history. She says it is not her job to notice that and not to mention that if she booked me for the 90 minute I would have saved some money on the special. My mind almost exploded, I said well wouldn't you then at the time I am booking ask me if I would like to book for the 90 minutes and take advantage of the special. She laughed at me and said \\\"Why would I do that, then you would get 90 minutes for cheaper then normal\\\". Are you freakin kidding me. \\n\\n1. How about asking me if I want to book for 90 since I always do and you know that is my preference.\\n2. How about you offer it to me as a paying member and inform me of the special since that who is the special is for.\\n3. The fact that you think it is better for your massage therapist to be sitting around doing nothing for the 30 minutes rather then up selling me to the special shows the lack of customer service or business management that is going on in this location.\\n4. your business comes from referrals and a good experience is the base of those referrals. The special was most likely created to generate more business not to be hidden form people and especially not to screw with the people who already book for 90 minutes and now you book it differently because you get $10 dollars less.\\n\\nBasically the lack of management and training of the customer service is a sign of a business being run by an absentee owner or an owner that just does not care anymore. So if you are planning on joining Massage Envy it is a great company and service I just would not do it at this location. THere are to many other places with better customer service and provide a better experience.\\n\\nFor the record I asked for the manager to email or call me to address this ongoing issue with the front desk and I have received no such contact for over a week now. This is why I wrote this review to warn you the people.\n\nAnswer:",

There is a Hard Rock Caf\\u00e9 on Paradise, right around the corner, so that was kind of confusing for some people.\\n\\nWhen we pulled up at 1:30pm, there was a line out the front door and around the corner.  We pulled into the Showcase parking and realized that it was $3.00 per car, CASH ONLY!!! and no coins.  We had 3 cars behind us, and neither my husband and I had any cash on us (doh!) but the car behind us paid for us (THANK YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE!  I will definitely pay-forward this good-deed of the day!)\\n\\nWe parked and went inside, only to wait another 15 minutes to get into the venue.  The venue itself was good size and it was layed out nicely.  There were TVs with the football games on and LOTS of beer tasting.  You can taste unlimited amounts of beer.  You get a 4 oz. shot glass (bigger than a regular shot glass) that you get to keep and that is what you taste all the beers out of.\\n\\nThe food line was pretty long, but we thought the food was damn good.  Coconut shrimp, wings, wontons, fresh veggies, cheese, nachos and so much more.  Good job on the free food!\\n\\nEveryone was really cool, friendly and helpful.

In that case, the individual would probably welcome the opportunity to skip out on the toys, electronics, home goods, and massive lines that characterize your average Super Walmart. They would probably be thrilled with the fact that this version of Walmart maintains the low prices but downsizes the space and speeds up checkout (and for that matter, has self-checkout, which larger Walmarts do not). \\n\\nHowever, since I shop for groceries elsewhere (my love, Fresh and Easy, or Fry's), only get food at Walmart if I'm also there shopping for other things, and see Walmart as a place to find home goods (paper products, cat food, towels) at really low prices, the Neighborhood Market doesn't really serve my needs. When I went to this location last night to check it out on the day of its grand opening, I discovered that the selection of non-food home goods is pretty small. As an example, they only had 2-3 brands of cat food. They also didn't have hard alcohol (only wine and beer), and the deli selection looked pretty slim. \\n\\nTo sum it up, if you frequent larger Walmarts for food, limited house goods, and the pharmacy, you will appreciate having a downsized version of the store. If you like going to Walmart to find a really large selection of every kind of product, you will probably not find the Neighborhood Market too useful.\n\nAnswer:",

The service was seriously lacking, the menu had no drinks listed (not even soda) and the 2 menus my bf and I received were both printed differently. To continue the inconsistent theme, all of my BFs food came out at once; the rice came out last WTH, 5 minutes later PART of mine arrived, then we had to remind the waitress that I had also ordered miso soup ( which should've come out before any of the sushi). Once all that was taken care of, my bf instantly noticed the over sized slices of salmon on his roll. While more is usually a good thing, if you can't  consistently slice fish (or any food for that matter) you have NO business being a sushi chef. The thick slices threw off the flavor consistency of the roll, and he didn't even finish his food; which has never happened at a sushi restaurant... Ever! He said the flavor was OK, not bad, but the whole experience was \\\"just off\\\" and \\\"not right\\\". My Caramelo roll tasted good, but it wasn't even sliced all the way thru, so ever other time I picked up a bite, it unwrapped the next piece.  I ended up cutting the damn thing with a fork! That chef needs to go back to school and work on his knife skills PRONTO! This all happened at 2pm, so it's not as if they were busy at all. Just like every thing else in Casa Grande, Senor Sushi suffers from laziness. This town has a long way to go. Nothing will ever improve if the people don't take pride in what they do; no matter how big or small the job.

I went in expecting snobbery and bullshit, given the nature of some of these reviews, but experienced nothing of the kind. I went for a going away fling for one of my gf's and she picked R+D as it was one of her favorite places for a cocktail and her top pick for a G+T in the area. \\n\\nWe arrived at 7PM, went up to the hostess and got the secret number to call and waited about 20 min for our table to get ready. Granted, I did get a little antsy, but that's mostly because I was starving and forgot all my purse snacks at home *sob*. Pro tip kids, ALWAYS bring a snack, I don't care if I sound 80 years old, when have you ever been disappointed when a snack appears?! \\n\\nAnyway, after we are seated, our host for the evening comes by, explains the menu and gives us some time to look it over. We're also introduced to the mixologist of the evening. Every drink sounds incredible, I want them all. Our waiter was also great at explaining each drink and making sure we knew what we were getting into. The G+T my GF ordered was infused at our table, explained in great detail, we even got to pass around the gin and smell it. It may have been $18, but it made her about 2 drinks. My drink (honey bee or something) came on fiiiire! Our last round of drinks also came on fire, which is just so much fun to watch. I wish I could remember what it was called, but I'll just have to go back. Who knows, it might actually be against the rules to tell you anyway. \\n\\nThe rules, yes there are some rules. Guys, you don't get to be sleazy and walk up to girls and hit on them. Also, no swearing. I broke this a few times, luckily it wasn't too loud and our waiter was no where in site. Flash photography, NOPE. The group next to us did get a slap on the wrist for this and my friend did mention she saw people get kicked out once for that. There were a few others, mostly, just don't be an ass and keep the place classy. \\n\\nOh, we also ordered food (try the grilled cheese and the scallops, soo freakin good). The 5 of us had 5 dishes and 7 drinks + tax + tip = $50ish a person, not bad at all in my book. Some of our drinks were more expensive, while others had more expensive entrees, plus the experience alone made me not care about dropping dough. Would I go every weekend? No. Would I want to go every once in a while, especially on a girls night? Heck yes! \\n\\nMy advice, get there early! The place only has space for less than 50 people. If you show up at 9PM on a Friday or Saturday, of course you are going to wait. What do you expect? Also, it's not some shit bar on Mill. You aren't going to get away without dropping at least $20-$30 on a few drinks, but they are worth it. The 2 drinks I had were perfectly made, got me buzzed, and came on fire.

A bar or a restaurant? Actually they are trying to be all 3 at the same time! The place looks big on the outset, gold fish bowl door and entrance lounge/bar. Very 70's blue, green and pink neon lighting, Go further in and you are hit by a monolith black (sparkling marble?) central block of a bar. To the left and right you have seating areas which is meant for dining and drinking. A spiral open staircase  (pick neon chase lights adorned) takes you to the restrooms. Which are clean(ish) where music is piped down to the speakers. - actually they play music in all areas. LOUD. \\nIn the back is smaller bar with a place that can be cordoned off. I was explained this is used a a VIP area or large group private dining. The latter I had experienced and which was well organised, but not so in execution. They had a lack of waiters, well no actually, there were enough staff serving, but they hadn't allocated not enough serving staff to our group. Food was not delivered to all at the same time and drinks orders kept being messed up. This all caused our meal to last longer and we were still eating when the place turned full on night club (23:00) with gyrating people bobbing in your view when on your coffee and cake. \\n\\nOn a different visit the wife and I went for a romantic anniversary meal. Their menu is extensive and a little pricey. I found the waiting staff friendly but difficult to summon. Did I mention the loud music before? Try having a meal for two in the same room were people are shouting drinks orders and are dancing around handbags around you, while in the meanwhile trying to hold a dinner conversation. Fail. It is not a nice experience having to raise your voice and sometimes even shout to the person sitting next to you. As a result most of that meal was spend in silence and using eye contact and hand gestures. An experience? yes. Romantic? no.\\n\\nThe last time I visited was with few friends from Italy and Switzerland and we used a booth in the corner, and oh.. what is that white thing on the wall pointing into that booth? yes.. a loudspeaker. We persevered and with a few cocktails and several shots of vodka it was easily overcome - just huddle together and shout like you were giving instruction to a rugby team. Italians are very well adapt to this, they actually enjoyed themselves - so a hit for them and a good choice if you are into this kind of environment and atmosphere. Loud, lively, bubbly and no chance of a conversation (no way you can use a pick-up line under these circumstances)\\n\\nSo on all occasions it was the noise that ruined any experience of a nice evening, that... or maybe I am getting too old for this.\n\nAnswer:",

With art covering the walls and a quirky type of jazz coming out of the speakers, the atmosphere is simultaneously fun and mellow with friendly baristas to match. Small groups will find it more spacious outside on the patio, but there are a few tables inside. Solo sippers have more freedom with all the counters and barstools along the walls. If you don't intend to get cozy, MadHouse also has a drive-thru; if you do, it's open all day and all night.\\n\\nTheir sizes have normal names! A medium blended drink comes in a 24-ounce cup, the equivalent of a Starbucks venti in size, but its contents are full of creativity and taste. Their grasshopper is a subtly minty mocha combination. I like their crushed coconut mocha, but have much more of their menu to try. I've only indulged in their blended drinks, but their brewed coffees and sandwiches tempt me every time! \\n\\nIf you want to use their internet, let them know when you order and you'll receive a one-time use code. The time limit is based on how much you spend (e.g. $4-7 = one hour of WiFi, $10+ = four hours), so the more you pay, the longer your WiFi privileges stay. \\n\\nI haven't settled on a favorite drink yet, but I've discovered my new perch.\n\nAnswer:",

Coming to the museum gives me a chance to relax and feed my soul with art on a regular basis.  The membership entitles you to bring another adult along so that is also a plus since it has given me a chance to introduce the museum to other friends and family members for free.\\n\\nJust in the year or so that I have been going it seems like this place is continually improving itself.  I have to admit that when I first moved to Phoenix I was disappointed at the museums here and I still feel like we are not up to par with other cities of the same size.  It is nice to see one art/culture venue that is striving to be better.  I have not been able to partake in all the events that they hold (tours, lectures, movie screenings, etc) since they mostly seem to fall on weeknights.  But I still have managed to see all the rotating exhibits (my favorite was the one on Cezanne and his contemporaries) while they are there.  It is great to have an excuse to get out of the 'burbs on the weekend and come enjoy downtown... or I guess its uptown... or midtown?

With the opportunity for them to be lazy and overpriced, they didn't disappoint, but some very important questions arose.\\n\\nLocated directly off the casino floor amongst a few other restaurants, LBS has a pretty open, plain, unassuming interior. I guess they're trying for the Texas/American theme with the bull horns, license plates on the ceiling, and paint peeling off the brick walls. I made the mistake of going during Monday night football, if you don't like your dinner interrupted by some jackass from the local radio station pulling names out of a hat for Twilight DVD's, pick a different night.\\nWhat I love about the menus is how many burgers you get to choose from, they really feature all their pre-made options, the do-it-yourself portion is really a side note. This is a bit different than a lot of the more recent burger ventures out there, and more than welcome. There are also sliders, salads and a few different shakes; none of which I tried on this trip.\\n\\nTo keep things simple I went with the 'Classic' so I could easily sample the meat and basic toppings. Cooked almost as ordered, my medium-rare burger had great flavor, the meat was tasty and had a slight peppery flavor to it that I've noticed with more than a few burgers lately. The pickles had strong flavor along with the other fresh toppings and were all quite good. The bun was a little on the stiff side, but I found myself ok with it through the course of the meal. Overall I was very impressed with the flavor and was happy with the results.\\n\\nThe part that threw me was the fries; supposedly 'fresh cut', they were just not good. It's always very difficult to fall in love with a great burger when the fries you're presented with suck. I know this is a burger blog, but the fries are an extremely important part of a burger meal, and these really took away from it. They weren't awful, they just weren't that great. I feel like a lot of places are getting very lazy with their fries and that's a problem. And before anyone complains, I must point out how many people love In-N-Out but hate their fries. Am I right?\\n\\nAt $11.95 for my burger, I don't think it was too high, especially for a casino location. The meat was great, and the burger was very tasty. That price even includes fries, so by the time you add a drink you're only around $14-15 which is still almost in the crappy Five Guys or Smashburger territory, but with way better flavor. LBS is definitely worth the trip to Red Rock, let's just get them to work on their fries a bit and I might give them a higher score.\n\nAnswer:",

Truth be told, I've had much better chicken burgers in my life.

Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I had a coupon when I stayed at the Plaza it was for free admission to the show, which I figured there was some kind of catch. When I went to get my ticket at the concerge desk. The lady told me there was a $5 box office charge and 2 drink min and the total would be $25, I asked here how much was a reg ticket to the show and she told me $89, which was a lie. So I get my 2 drink tickets, which should be valued at $10 a piece. I go to the bar and ask for a redbull vodka and he told me you could only get well drinks, really so my free drink is not even worth the $10, what a rip off.\n\nAnswer:",

I figured, it would be best to stay close to the airport so we didn't have to deal with the rush hour traffic. Driving in from the Denver area, I asked my girlfriend to look for a place close to the airport. She found this place on Google with very good reviews. I'm not sure why she didn't use TripAdvisor. Probably because I always tell her \\\"Google Knows everything\\\" lol. Anyway, we arrived and were greeted by a nice young lady and the place seemed fine. The lobby area was clean. We made our way to the room, which upon first glance seemed okay. The sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean. However, as we made our way in, I noticed the musty odor that is mentioned in other reviews. I decided to look at some reviews and see if maybe we were the lucky recipient of a room that had not been renovated yet. After reading the reviews and comments from the manager, I figured this must be the case. No problem right? Sure, I called down to the front desk and said to the nice young lady \\\"I see in your reviews, the hotel is having some renovations done and it seems we have received one of the musty smelling rooms that hasn't been addressed yet. Do you have a room that has been renovated, that we can be moved to?\\\" Her response was, \\\"we have been doing some renovations, however not to the rooms. I don't have a nicer room that I can move you to. Sorry.\\\" Well, I said to my girlfriend, it's just one night and I don't feel like driving to another hotel. After sitting on the old, run down, uncomfortable love seat watching TV for a while, I said, we should probably move to the bed as it has to be better than this seat. So, we got ready for bed and pulled the comforter back to find sheets that must have been queen size because they definitely didn't fit this king size bed. Whatever, hey the bed has like six pillows on it and two extra in the closet. Great, not, the pillows were plentiful, however they're about half the size of a normal pillow. Okay, I'm tired of trashing the place. Have a look at the pictures (worth a thousand words.) I'm sure with some true renovations, this will be a decent place to stay. I would guess the very good reviews this place has received are the work of some reputation building company or maybe we did just receive one of the older rooms and they didn't want to relocate us. Not returning anytime soon.\\n\\nStayed October 2013\n\nAnswer:",

This was my first experience at a revolving sushi bar, which was super fun!  I would highly recommend sitting right next to the conveyor belt if you go in a group because that was the best part of my experience and I was in complete shock how cheap our bill was when we were done\\n\\nThe sushi was, mehh.  There was only 1 roll that we pulled that I thought was great, but everything else was just ok (and we tried ALOT)...Lots of imitation crab which is probably how they keep the prices so low.  I'd go again, I suppose, if someone else wanted to but only after recommending another place first.

Even if there is the strong push for Nooks and Kindles abound, it's still so much fun to hang out here!  \\n\\nWhat I love most about B&N in particular, is that you can find a spot in one of their \\\"reading areas\\\" and kick up your legs, and read a book for \\\"FREE!\\\"  Yup, grab a bunch of books or a handful of fashion magazines and go to town. This place is perfect for a lazy morning or afternoon.  \\n\\nThis B&N happens to be in a great location. It's well organized and the staff is friendly and helpful. My only gripe is that the starbucks cafe gets crowded and it's always hard to find a seat.  So, if you want to kick up your legs and relax, get there before the crowd on the weekends. \\n\\nIf you're a bookworm, make sure you ask about their membership card ($25 for one year). Once you're enrolled (like me) you get some decent benefits like: 40% off the list price of the current hardcover B&N Store Bestsellers or 10% off the B&N already discounted items, Bargain books, music, movies, Caf\\u00e9 and almost everything else. This discount also applies to Text Books for all you college students out there.\n\nAnswer:",

But that doesn't mean I won't drive around town checking the other Gold's out.  I decided to give this gym a try since it is fairly close to home.  \\n\\nI was immediately disappointed with just the size of this gym.  My second impression, this gym is stuffy and lacking ventilation.  I came in on a Saturday night and there was about 10 other gym goers doing their thing.  This gym is so small that even with less than 15 of us in the gym, it felt crowded.  This gym is lacking a lot from equipment to free-weights.  There's only one of everything here which means you have to wait just to get on a bench.  I just can't imagine what it's like on Monday around 5 PM.  \\n\\nCardio is located upstairs and the ventilation is even worse.  You almost feel like you're doing cardio in an attic up there. The gym tried fixing this issue by placing a few commercial fans up there, but it's not enough.  Perhaps this could be perfect for someone wanting to burn a ton of calories during cardio since it feels like it's over 100 degrees up there. \\n\\nI'm glad I gave this place a try.  Now I know that this is one of those Gold's that I plan on avoiding in the future.  Still giving them 3 stars because it is a gym and I still managed to get a great workout.\n\nAnswer:",

What lies between MEH and A-OK?   OK.  Like the first Matrix sequel.  Not bad.  Not good.  Just OK.\\n\\nTypically I stay at the Mirage when I Vegas and so I try to slip into the Cravings for breakfast.  I would not say anything is gourmet or jaw dropping, but you can put together almost any breakfast you can imagine reasonably enough.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the most disappointing aspect of the breakfast is the lame 80's era hotel coffee.  Mirage -- you don't have to serve Starbucks.  Go to a local Panera or Einsteins Bagels to get an idea of what you should be serving.  Something smooth with some flavor.  Not bland weak nothingness.   You should be embarrassed at this point.\\n\\nI've read other reviews that indicate this buffet used to rule Las Vegas.  I'm not really convinced any buffet can rule much of anything.  I tried to over-rated Wynn buffet and the far superior Paris buffet and I'm simply not sold on the idea that any buffet can challenge a reasonably good restaurant.  But that's not why buffets are in Vegas.  They are there to offer cheap fast eats.  They are cafeterias with delusions of grandeur.\\n\\nThe Cravings is a decent 'cafeteria' if you will.  The sushi lacks fish, the shrimp is plump and bottomless, the coffee (again) sucks, and they'll toss you a tasty salad of your dreams.  Like I said, it's OK... for a buffet.\\n\\nThe Mirage has been good about updating itself and I think it's time my favorite affordable resort re-invent the buffet.  Scrap the silly name.  Pull the Studio 54 gold and mirrors out of the interior.  \\n\\nI'm hearing good things about what the Cosmopolitan is doing it.  Take what works and fix what doesn't over there, bring it to the Mirage.  Charge higher prices to people walkin' in off the street but give resort guests a bold discount -- and name said discount as a benefit of the resort fee.\n\nAnswer:",

Now that this has been established, the hotel itself is very nice!  I am not a big gambler and smoker so this hotel is perfect!  It is a little far off the strip but it is right next to the mall!  Upon arrival, we did valet (only option) and our bags were loaded on and ready to go.  Called before hand to see if we could check in (3pm check-in) but they said we had to do it at 3.  When we got there (around 2:30), we were able to check in and swim!  The pool was nice.  Not too crowded like other places where you can barely move anywhere!  Drinks were pricey too!  \\n\\nThe hotel is super nice.  Big bathroom with a shower, toilet, jet tub, and a TV built into the mirror.  Loved watching TV while doing some business ;)  First night, had a great night sleeping in the most comfortable beds ever!! \\n\\nOnto the 3 star review...after swimming at the pool on our second day, we decided to use the jet tub in the bathroom.  Turned on the water until it was full and turned on the jets.  Slowly getting in, it felt so good until something started spewing out of the jets.  Some kind of green foamy algae vommity type substance.... (GROSS!).  Maybe it was just something that was in the drain so my bf and i started scooping it out and throwing it on the bathroom towel that was on the floor....5 minutes of scooping was ridiculous so we decided to call the front desk and tell them about our problem.  Long story short, it took about 45 minutes to resolve this thing with waiting and talking and waiting and talking...etc.  This substance has never been seen before and we were in a hurry to get somewhere else.  They said they would put some tablets in there but I really needed to shower and go somewhere!  They SHOULD have offered an alternative such as giving us another room to shower or SOMETHING!  To solve this problem, they offered free breakfast, day spa passes, or  $75 credit. We really couldn't use the spa passes since we were leaving the next day, so they were nice enough to deduct our resort fee for 2 rooms that we booked.\\n\\nAlso, our remote didn't work in the bathroom.  We turned on the tv and that worked but later, around 12:00am, it wouldn't turn off.  My bf tried to switch the batteries from the outside room to the bathroom but still, we couldn't turn off the tv and it was blasting really loud!  Called the desk and they said they would send someone right up.  10 minutes later, a guy comes up and ask....\\\"uh do you want me to get someone for you?\\\"  UH YEAH!!! that's why we called!!!  \\\"UH what do you want me to do?\\\"  \\\"Do anything you can to turn off this damn TV!\\\"  Wow.....\\n\\nOverall good hotel, except for that incident.  If that hadn't happened along with slow service, I might come back.\\n\\nNOTE:\\n-kitchen included\\n-jet tub\\n-valet\\n-shuttle to wynn and caesar's palace\\n-can hear the train at night while sleeping\\n-free wi-fi\\n-free slippers (upon request)\\n-no casino\n\nAnswer:",

I ordered a Rocketburger with cheese and a fountain drink.  My total was just under $12.00.  Here is how it was..........\\n\\nRocketburger with cheese-  Meh.  This thing came with 3 patties, lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese.  It also had pickles and a \\\"rocket sauce\\\" aka thousand island.  The bun was a sub type roll and was fine.  All the ingredients were not that great though.  The burgers were way way way too salty, small and didn't taste good. The dressing had a weird \\\"tang\\\" to it also.  The cheese and bun were the only good things about it.  At around $10.00, I was dissapointed.  My mouth was swollen dry afterwards because of the salt!  Never again!  I ate the whole thing but would never get another one.\\n\\nDiet Pepsi-  This was partly my bad.  They have 1000 or so bottled sodas for sale but I chose a fountain drink.

We saw some entrees we would eat on the menu so we went in. First, the waiter was very friendly. We went during lunch. It wasn't busy at all. It apparently was happy hour but they said you had to go to a separate bar however, no one was at that bar. \\n\\nOnce we were ready, we ordered our drinks, appetizer and food. Our lunch came out before our appetizer. When the waiter realized it, my husband refused it at that point but the manager came out and said she would comp it so we agreed to take it, even though it was late and pointless. \\n\\nThe food was average. The sweet tea was delish though!! \\n\\nWhile waiting to receive our bill, one of those outside camera ladies came up and asked if we would like our picture taken. She had a very strong accent so it was really hard to understand her but just said \\\"sure\\\" anyway. When she came back after developing the photos and showing us the cost, we refused and she was a bit annoyed and rude about it. Whatever.\\n\\nOnce we got our bill, we noticed the appetizer was not comped. We didn't say anything cause we figured if we got comped for the appetizer, we wouldn't use the 10% off. Then the waiter noticed we had the 10% off so he said \\\"oh, I didn't see that, I will adjust the bill.\\\" When he came back, the amount wasn't even touched. We paid for the appetizer we didn't want since it was late but agreed to take cause we were told it would be comped AND we didn't even get the 10% off they gave us at the door.\\n\\nWill we be back??

Pretty much, you get a candlelit tour of the plantation at night. And your tour guide gives a history lesson on the house and plantation, as well as shares some ghost stories that either they/coworkers have experienced.\\n\\nIf you come at night, it can be a little scary getting here. Once you turn off the main street, you're driving down a dark road with nature on both sides of you. Since we were already in a spooky spirit, it kind of felt like we were in a horror movie, hehe. Once you arrive at the plantation though, you just park and walk into their little gift shop. After everyone arrives, you watch a little video about the history of the place, including paranormal history. After that, your tour starts.\\n\\nYou walk over to the house, and tour the house, from downstairs to upstairs. Then, you walk outside to the outdoor kitchen, and then to a workmen's shed. Then you walk past an old log cabin, and then get led back to the main gift shop. \\n\\nThe tour guide we had a was a very informative old lady. She told us a lot of history, and I learned new things. At one point of the tour, I did get a little lightheaded, and felt a little weird, and it was near an area where the tour guide said that she also has had weird feelings. What's even weirder is that on our back home, my dad was telling me that he got lightheaded in a certain area, and when I asked him where, it was the same place I had gotten the same feeling! It was kinda spooky finding that out, but then kind of cool.\\n\\nThe tour was about ~$10 and I think it was worth it. I got a little spook, and learned a good history lesson. And I visited a historic plantation.\\n\\nIf you're visiting the area, and are looking for something interesting and different to do, I suggest coming here. No matter what time of year. But if you happen to come during October, then you'll just get an added bonus of hearing some ghost stories along the way too.\n\nAnswer:",

It's hard to find a decent place for sushi that doesn't cost an arm and a leg...except at dozo. Here you get the best of both.

The prices for the rolls are great too with the specialty rolls topping out at like $11-12 for 8 rather large pieces and they don't skimp on the fish in them. A good judge is that a  negihama roll had not chopped yellowtail but slices of fish and plenty of scallion for i think $5.\\n\\nThe only things keeping this place from a 5 star are that it can take awhile to get the food (even when you are the only people there) and some of the rolls aren't wrapped well so it's hard to pick them up with chopsticks.

Traffic was normal.  \\n\\nThe place was full when we arrived a little after 7, but a table became available 10 minutes after we arrived.  Save for a party of two, none of the people sitting in the restaurant had food.  Understandably, we were last in the queue for a full house, but we didn't even get drinks until 8:30.   That means we had to sit under fluorescent lights with nothing but a screaming baby to soothe our nerves.  It felt like waiting for your name to get called in an emergency room.  \\n\\nOver the course of the evenng, three other parties arrived after we did, and their wait for food and drink was not as long.  I understand that timing is everything and we probably came at the worst possible time.   That said, after reading other Yelpers say that service was slow, we had no way of knowing that \\\"slow\\\" meant we would wait more than an hour for drinks, more than 1.5 hours for appetizers, and about 2 hours for food.  Under fluorescent lights.  With a boor or two yelling nearby.\\n\\nAm I complaining about service?  No, because the old man that ran the joint did all that he could.  He was as sweet as can be.  It just may be that a little place like this cannot handle all the business from all the buzz. \\n\\nThe Ecuadorian fish ceviche was unbelievably good and hearty.  Seco de chivo (goat stew) was tasty.  Love the plaintains.  The merlot was surprisingly good (no burn going down despite the low price tag of $4.50/glass).  We had 3 kinds of empanadas -- two were okay, one was not good.  Hubby's steak was flavorful but tough.  \\n\\nThe food is worth the price and I strongly suspect that the kitchen performs better when the place is not packed to the gills.

First off, the menu.  Their menu is very vegetarian friendly.  Hummus, spin-art dip, soft pretzels, tater tots, pizza, cheese plates, 2 veggie sammies, some salads and a Spicy Beer Cheese Soup that I wish I had tried.  So I definitely give credit to a place that tries to be veg-friendly.\\n\\nI ordered the Hippie Burger (veggie patty).  It was OK.  But the thing was that it came with a side, and I asked the server if the potato salad had bacon in it.  She said no.  But the first bite had bacon in it.  So, I'll just say that I was very dissatisfied with that.\\n\\nWhatever, I kept trucking.  And anyways, the real reason to go to this place is the beer.  I'm sure other reviewers have gone into great detail about their gigantic beer selection, so I'll keep it short.  While the idea is great, it falls a little short.  While the size of the menu is supposed to be its selling point, its just too big!!!  And it has a lot of filler.  I noticed one reviewer who said that this is the biggest beer selection in NC.  Well, maybe, but biggest is not necessarily best (innuendo unavoidable :)  It's hard to take a lot of pride in a beer bar that has a bunch of macros and second rate micros, but (if my eyes don't deceive me) not a single saison?  And barely any lambics to speak of.  Whatever, they still have some pretty good stuff, I'm just being picky, but it seems like with a little quality control their selection could go from good to great.\\n\\nThis one was a little tough to rate.  Part of me wants to give it a 2 (bacon), part a 3 (atmosphere), part a 4 (beer and food menu), and part a 5 (the idea).  So take that 3 I gave it according to what you want out of this place.\\n\\nOh yeah, this place can be REALLY loud inside.  Like uncomfortably loud, so might want to grab seat outside if that bothers you.\n\nAnswer:",

I order my appetizer and a margarita and they didn't have frozen machine yet OK I can understand its a new location... we placed our orders and I want it to try something different I order chicken burrito and a chicken fajita order. First we never got the appetizer and the main course was not good my rice was hard and looks and taste old, the beans were hard the chicken was ok . I ask for the hot sauces on the side and they put inside. At the end we order another round of drinks cause we need a drink after eating that and we never got our drinks. Service was OK I guess.

A comment was made because I brought a special salad in I have to eat because of my health and doctor recommendations. My daughter and wife ate off the menu, and i split the lunch with my wife. Maybe it's because of health laws, which I was made aware of by the waiter, but the initial remark sparked this yelp comment.  He did tell me later he realized we did order from the menu, but reminded me you don't come into a bar and bring your own beer!   True, but then I also have to adhere to my food i brought and not letting it spoil in the hot car. I will not say i'm not at fault on this entirely, but  I should have consulted the manager prior.

She picked out some great dresses, and we were off to the fitting rooms.  Now this is we had the problems.  \\n\\nI walked into the fitting room with her as usual (to help her with zipping them on).  I have done this numerous times throughout the day at Macy's and other dept stores without any problems.  I was then yelled at by an \\\"employee\\\" who told me that I WAS NOT ALLOWED IN THERE!!!.  My girfriend and I felt threatened and instead chose to find another fitting room.  We decided not to argue with the \\\"employee\\\"\\n\\nThen we walked about 100 feet to the right of the juniors department and found a fitting room, and a rather helpful associate helped us in, with no issues whatsoever about me having a penis.  We were in the middle of trying on our third dress, (which we found one that we really liked, and fit well too), then another employee came knocking on the door stating that \\\"MEN AREN'T ALLOWED IN THE FITTING ROOMS\\\" and I explained that I was just helping her zip on the dress, and had no intentions other than that.  She said she would help her zip on the dress if she needed it.  I explained that she did not feel comfortable with anyone else touching her, and seeing her in the fitting room without me being there.  That was not satisfactory enough for the employee and I stated that we would would be leaving and no longer be customers of Dillards ever again.  \\n\\nWhat  a shame, as Men are treated differently than woman, and just because I happened to have a penis, then I wasn't allowed.  We were planning on making a purchase on a Sunny Sunday afternoon, and some employees just made our day a hell of a lot worse than when we walked in.\\n\\nI later called the store that afternoon to see if I could speak with a manager, and was given one over the phone.  The conversation was about how I was treated, and she stated that they don't' let men even be employed in the Juniors dept. What a sexist policy.\\n\\nDon't let your 1955 set-in ways hit your ass on your way out of my wallet you sexist, chauvinistic \\\"company\\\"\n\nAnswer:",

(Still not too bad, if you can deal with that)\\nPizza sauce: Not bad, but also not too bold in flavor. \\nPizza topping: Very generous! Lots of ham covered the entire Hawaiian pizza, plus a mountain of pineapple. There were also a nice amount of pepperoni and mushrooms on the other slice. \\nCheese: Decent. There was a good amount of melty mozzarella. \\nSize: Nice decent slice. (It filled me up)\\n\\nNote: Even though they were generous with the pepperoni, it wasn't the highest of quality and didn't have the best flavor. Not even salty.

Also a generous amount of scalding hot cheese with a nice crispy crust. It wasn't poor, it just wasn't groundbreaking - average at most.

The waiter was nice enough but when we pointed out the errors he replied \\\"What do you want me to do?\\\"  Well after waiting almost an hour to get our crappy, cold, incorrect food we didn't want to risk sending it back to the kitchen and wait for them to correct it.  We were told \\\"the kitchen was slammed\\\" ... did he not know we were sitting in the same room he was?  And that we have eyes?  Because the place was less than half full so I fail to see how they could be \\\"slammed\\\", which by the way is also not my problem.  I don't care if the manager didn't staff properly or people called in, you're supposed to be professionals at this level, its not Burger King.\\n\\nAnyway, my pretzel appetizer was wrong, my blackened chicken pasta was cold and bland, and they make mojitos with ground leaves for you to choke on.\\n\\nI was really disappointed and doubt I'll go back to any Claim Jumpers as there are so many other places to try in LV.\n\nAnswer:",

There were 4 of us, with two more on the way. The not so pleasant manager said they do not sit incomplete parties...are you joking, there were so many open tables!! We said we'd like to be seated to order drinks, they refused. So we waited a few minutes, went back up to the host stand asked if they really couldn't seat us with all the open tables, it seemed a little ridiculous.  Still a very rude no. We left went to another Venetian Italian restaurant, got seated right away.  Will never go back, horrible service.

I have always stayed at one of the hotels on the main part of the Strip, so at first I was a little wary of staying on the edge at Trump. I am SO glad that we did, though. Because Trump doesn't have a casino and is nonsmoking, the experience was just way more relaxed - and we were still able to go to other hotels for restaurants and clubs! The staff at Trump is excellent and everyone we interacted with was super professional, courteous and just plain friendly. The rooms are large and clean, and I absolutely adore the deep tubs in the bathrooms. We spent Saturday by the pool and reserved a cabana, something I highly recommend doing. The pool is low key but the music is great, and Sebastian (the person helping us) was the best! My only complaint is that the cabanas are poorly designed - the AC is positioned in such a way that it actually sends cold air OUT of the cabana instead of into it...weird. We also ate a lot of food at Trump, both in the restaurant area downstairs and through room service. Room service was AMAZING (get the onion rings!) - I highly recommend ordering in after a long night, they serve 24 hrs. The breakfast downstairs was stellar too - I loved the crab cake eggs benny. Overall this was just a great experience and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!\n\nAnswer:",

Unfortunately, those days are LONG gone.  \\n\\nToday I went to drive thru and one car was at the pick-up window and one car was in front of me at the speaker/menu board.  I waited - waited - and waited for him to order so I could pull up and order.  Then I realized what the problem was.  They took his order at the speaker/menu and as he pulled up to window, I pulled up to speaker/menu and was asked to \\\"Please wait.\\\"  As car in front pulled away from the pick-up window, I was finally told (via speaker) to proceed with my order.  While I was at the pick-up window, I looked in my rear view mirror to see the car behind me still waiting at the speaker/menu board.  WHAT?????  It was 11:00 AM!!  \\n\\nNow, on to my order:  Chicken Caesar Wrap was literally thrown together.  When I opened the paper, the wrap was basically just a tortilla with lettuce and chicken on top, barely folded up into a \\\"wrap.\\\"   Ordered unsweetened tea, but actually received sweet tea!!  Ordered a small Baja Salad - which was fine.  I did have to request a knife and fork.   My order wasn't messed up too badly this time, but it is irritating to order something and not receive what you ordered.   Many times I have requested no cheese, yet received cheese and ordered extra pickles and not received any pickles.  Arrgh!!!!  FRUSTRATING!!! \\n\\nOn one occasion, I went inside to place my to-go order and Wendy's had some \\\"big men\\\" in suits behind the counter.  One little older woman behind the counter  was trying to give orders (commands) and confusing the young lady making the sandwich.  The  day shift cashier - who has been there for at least 6 years and KNOWS her job well was trying to help explain what the customer had ordered, but this little woman would hardly let her explain anything - just telling her to keep on at the register.  Great!  Now we have 6 people lined up at this counter and none of the orders are coming out correctly.   \\n\\nWithin the last 2 years, this Wendy's has gone down hill with the service.  Seems that if you make any request (extra pickles, no cheese, etc.) it still comes the way the menu shows; IT DOES NOT MATTER what you request.  It is really sad that this has happened; it USED to be my favorite Wendy's to go to - not anymore.   I only go here because it is close to work.  I've called the 800 number too, but it seems that nothing ever comes of it....the problems at this Wendy's still continue.\n\nAnswer:",

The food was fair, but the atmosphere was cool enough to make up for it.  They had really cool move artifacts, like Darth Vador's costume.  The vibe was also energetic.  It actually felt like stepping into something from Hollywood.  The food wasn't too expensive, maybe $8-10 a plate, and the portions were generous enough that you left satisfied - if not blown away.\\n\\nOn our recent trip to Vegas, we decided to give it a try again.  Now with two young children, we thought this might be a fun experience for them.  We learned that the location had changed and made our way to the new restaurant.  When I saw it, I should have turned the other way.  The new d\\u00e9cor was an attempt to be cool, without pulling it off.  Kind of like a geeky school kid wearing what he thinks is the latest fashion.  PH no longer had the dark vibe, but instead looked like it was designed by IKEA with red chairs and a modern look.  In addition, the movie artifacts were meager and not interesting.  For example, they have a dress form some movie that no one cares about.  The only cool thing that I recall was a model of the Starship Enterprise.  \\n\\nWell, maybe the food would make up for it.  My wife and I ordered expensive entr\\u00e9e salads.  My children ordered something off of the children's menu.  The children's menu was overpriced and about the quality of McDonald's food.  Both of my children left hungry.  The salads tasted fairly good, but the portions were ridiculously small.  Sorry PH, you can't make yourself a top quality restaurant by simply reducing your portion sizes.  That is the first sign of a crappy restaurant in my opinion.  They think they can give you practically nothing to eat and pretend that they are upscale.  I don't mind that at the right restaurant, with best-in-the-country chefs, but PH is far from that.  Instead, PH serves food about the quality of Chilies' and can't pull of the small portion sizes.  At least somewhere like Chilies' makes up for food quality by giving you enough food to leave full.  So, in the end, I had a fairly good tasting salad, which was too small to satisfy, and too expensive to ever motivate me to come back.  We spent over $60 for two adult meals, two children's meals, and no drinks or appetizers.  \\n\\nThe worst part, and the reason I think the place shows signs of eminent closure was the stupid post card fraud.  They show up at your table, when you just want to be left alone and ask if they can take the families picture for a \\\"complamentry postcard.\\\"  Then, after you have finished and want to get out of the place, they show up with the postcard.  The postcard is the size of a postcard, but the photograph has been reduced to the size of a postage stamp.  Then, they pull out some fancier versions and try to sell them to you for ridiculous prices.  Oh yah, I want to spend $25 to commemorate my lousy dinner at your restaurant.  No thanks.  And of course, they don't take the first no as a no and keep pushing.  I almost lost my cool with them at that point.   I gathered the family and got out of there.

The atmosphere is very classy and feels very much like a place where adults would enjoy a sweet treat. The selection is great and the flavors all sound very delicious. I was a little confused by the menu located behind the freezers, which may have contributed to the high cost of my gelato. Ultimately I ended up buying the medium-sized, two flavor gelato... which can range in weight up to 3oz (or $2.50) depending on how the server decides to scoop it.\\n\\nWhile the gelato is excellent, it is overpriced in my opinion. I don't think I can justify spending $6 on a tiny dish of frozen goodness, no matter how good it may be. This place will be an occasional treat but isn't likely to be a frequent stop.\n\nAnswer:",

Great owner. Issues with punctuality and communication. This was a really tough review to write and I wish I could give different star values for different aspects of the business. I'm going to do my best just to stick to the facts here.\\n\\nNow for the details:\\nWe needed an estimate to replace all of the AC duct work in our crawl space. Had one estimate from another company and called Mark's after reading all of the positive Yelp reviews. Here's how it went down:\\n\\nWednesday: Called around 3pm asking to set up an appointment for an estimate. Easton says he can come sometime before 5 that day to look things over. Receive another call at 5:30 saying it is very hot outside and he would rather come tomorrow morning instead. Make an appointment for 9 on Thursday. \\n\\nThursday: Hubby called me at 10 asking if I had heard from them since no one had come or called. Called and Easton said they were running late but would be there by 11. He showed up at 12:30 without any additional notification (phone call, etc). Once he was actually on site, hubby liked Easton and the price was good enough that we decided to have the work done. Easton said he would call to schedule it. After a day of not hearing from them we called him and scheduled it for Monday. He said they would be there by 9 to start the job.\\n\\nMonday: Around 10:30, hubby called me to ask if I had heard from Easton, since they had not arrived. Remember, they were supposed to start a multi-hour job at 8am, and this is July in Phoenix- I doubt they were looking forward to being up in our crawl space come mid-afternoon. Called Easton and he said that they had had several emergency calls that morning and couldn't start as early as they wanted to so they pushed us to tomorrow instead. Without calling to let us know! When I asked why we had not been notified Easton replied that they did not have the invoice with our phone number! \\nNow I understand that in Phoenix in the summer, a non-working air conditioner is an emergency situation and schedules change (I work by appointment, I get that). However, I don't understand why we weren't notified of the schedule change. When I asked this, Easton replied, \\\"do you want us to do the job, or not? If you don't we can just not do it.\\\"\\n\\nAt this point, we had only dealt with Easton. I asked him for Mark's phone number thinking that I might have better luck with him. Fortunately, I did. Mark was extremely understanding and apologetic. He asked when we wanted the job started on Tuesday (8am) then offered to come out with Easton and make sure everything was to our satisfaction.\\n\\nTuesday: Phone call at 8:15 from Easton saying that they were running late and would be there shortly. I think they arrived around 9. Hubby says the work went according to plan, Mark showed up and was very apologetic, and it was all finished by about 1pm.\\nWhen I got home later that day I was looking over the invoice and realized that they had only cleaned the inside coils, not the outer ones on the unit up on the roof. I called Mark to ask about it and he sent Easton out later that day to clean the outside coils as well.\\n\\nIn the end, this is a good company that could be great with some improved communication and scheduling. Hubby says that before Easton left our place on Tuesday he heard him on the phone with another client who had called because he was late. He told her he would be there in another hour but that he had another visit or two ahead of her. It seems like he is trying to fit too many visits into too short of a time frame instead of scheduling more realistically.\n\nAnswer:",

Looking beyond the really nice decor and well done interior remodel of the restaurant formerly known as J. Alexander's, everything else seemed very lack luster.\\n\\nI made a call to get a group of three on the waiting list on a Friday night, and the hostess almost seemed confused at my request. When we arrived, we were told that the hostess only had marked us down for a group of two...alright, no big deal, an honest mistake I guess. There was about a 20 minute wait so we decided to get some drinks at the bar. It was pretty crowded, but the bartender was fairly dismissive and not overly friendly upon our arrival, just a quick delivery of the menu and \\\"what will you be drinking?\\\"..hmm okay.\\n\\nWhen we got the text message that our table was ready, the same absent minded hostess sat us, and only brought two menus. I'm not sure what the deal was, but we clearly had a party of three, c'mon now! When our server arrived, he was kind enough to offer a smile and a proper greeting. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer right away and had our drink order placed. When he came back over, he spieled the specials for the night - and REALLY emphasized the new bruschetta, which we had already ordered. At this point, the series of service miscues were almost laughable to us and we figured we were already there so let's just roll with the punches.\\n\\nEntrees came out, and my girlfriend had the steak cobb salad which was good, her mom had the polenta which was fine, and I had the New York French Dip which is their \\\"twist\\\" on a prime rib shaved sandwich. It instead has shaved New York strip on it and I must say, I was completely underwhelmed by the flavor of the sandwich - just bland, bland, bland.\\n\\nHonestly, I know I'm ranting and raving in this review, but it was a totally mediocre experience. It is amazing what a remodel can do to a restaurant, as it was pretty full and seemed more lively than when J. Alexander's was the occupant, but I don't think the food is any better - in my opinion, its not even as good and the service is definitely not up to par. \\n\\nMaybe I'll give Paul Martin's a second chance, but I'll keep my regularity and loyalty to Houston's and Hillstone for my All-American cuisine fix.\n\nAnswer:",

Each girl would take a hour, so we set-up everyone's times accordingly.  The order was mother of the bride, mother of the groom, grandmother of the groom, bridesmaid, bridesmaid, MOH and then the bride.  The wedding photographers were coming at 11am to start taking pictures & this was also around the time the bride was supposed to get her makeup and hair done.  \\n\\nThey started on us right away because they told us they had another appointment to get to by 9am.  Really?  So what was promised of at least 6 hours of hair & makeup was rushed and crammed to 2.5 hours.  As you can imagine, the quality and care that diminished was really apparent in the end result.  \\n\\nMy hair was started first & I just wanted loose curls/waves.  I brought in pictures.  My hair is long and thick & I usually do loose curls, so I was fairly confident that this would turn out okay.  The only styling product she used was a crap load of hairspray, which left my hair nappy, tangled and dry looking.  She told me she would run her fingers through my curls after my makeup was done.  After she was done & everyone rushed to their next appointment, I was left with chunks of my hair that was missed.  On to the makeup...\\n\\nI wear full makeup the same way everyday, so I brought in pictures of myself with makeup because I just wanted to look like how I always do.  I also fill-in my eyebrows, and for those of you who do your eyebrows everyday know how particular this can get.  Again, providing pictures of my own eyebrows and also close-up of eyebrows, I figured I'd be okay.  Wrong!  Because the girl was so rushed, she failed to notice my eyebrows were darker than even my hair & one eyebrow was smudged off in the process of doing my eyeshadow.  I don't know all the makeup jargon, but I told her I wear a smoky eye everyday & provided pictures.  Not only did it not look like the pictures, but she also decided to take it upon herself to use lighter colors.  After realizing my makeup would look nothing like the pictures I provided OF MYSELF WITH MAKEUP, I just wanted to end it & go fix my makeup myself.\\n\\nThe bride & I have small tattoos that we wanted covered & the person the bride booked with said this would be no problem.  This was not communicated between the staff because she said she had no idea of this & could not accommodate this because, again, she had to be somewhere at 9am.  For me, I don't care..I'm just the MOH (not the bride), so if she's so rushed for time, she should at least do the bride.  This is her day...if a service was guaranteed to her, then just get it done.  With attitude, she attempted to slap on some concealer & then wiped it off saying nothing could be done.  This was not a mistake done by the clients so proper service and professionalism, you'd think they would at least do the bride.  \\n\\nThere were two makeup people and two hair people.  One makeup girl did a great job.  She did two makeup jobs in the time it took the other girl to do 4 people.  The other girl took her time & their makeup was great.  Unfortunately, the person's makeup that should be flawless is the bride & she was left in tears.  Not only did most of us have to fix our makeup because the airbrushing was rushed, splotchy, and spots were missed...the bride's makeup should at least be done correctly.  If one girl was taking more time, then she should have done the bride's makeup. In hindsight, a lot of things could have been different & it's unfortunate it had to happen on such an important day.\\n\\nThey were in such a rush to get done and get out to their next appointment they really didn't give a crap about providing good service.  On your wedding day, that is an awful feeling.  So everyone was done by 8:30am & the wedding wasn't until 4pm.  We were scheduled to be done at 12:45pm, so we had to fix all our makeup and hair & sit around hoping our makeup would hold until the wedding. The photographers arrived at 11am expecting to catch shots of the bride getting her hair & makeup & these are photo opportunities the bride will never have.\\n\\nIf you're desperate to book hair & makeup and this is the only place available, you are better off doing your own makeup.  If this isn't possible, make sure you are clear about the service you're expecting and the time they will be spending.  And if they don't spend the time they promised, be sure to get it in writing to be refunded or else this company is a absolute waste of money.  You can't afford to take risks on such an important day, so I would recommend going through any other vendor for this.\n\nAnswer:",

I was so happy to hear that, because lets be honest, during cold and flu season we are hesitant to receive the wine. Talk to the sacristan about 10-15 minutes before mass, tell them you need a gluten free host. The thing is, is that you must receive it from the priest because the Eucharistic ministers don't carry it, and you must sit on the right hand side of the church to ensure you get the priest.

It was our first time at Tailgaters and short of something monumental happening, it will be our last.\\n\\nThe decor is ok, it screams pizza joint turned sports bar.  This works out and will be great come summer when trying to find a cool, dark place to get out of the heat.  The restroom was clean and interestingly, the only place where I learned of the daily specials (they were posted on the wall by the sinks) after we ordered (the waitress never said a word about them and we didn't see them anywhere in the actual bar/restaurant area).\\n\\nIt's all a downhill review from here so if you are looking for reasons to go, stop reading now!\\n\\nWe entered the place to find two people standing at the front desk and a sign reading \\\"please seat yourself.\\\"  While the two holding the desk up appeared to acknowledge our presence, we were not greeted.  We selected a table away from the crowd in the bar because all the high tops appeared to be for larger groups and we were there to have a late lunch not get sh*t-faced on happy hour specials...\\n\\nThe first person to approach us might have been a manager and seemed concerned about how long we had been sitting without attention.  The main man asked about the on-tap selection as he thought a beer would taste good on the lovely spring day (remember we were primarily there for lunch not booze).  This guy didn't know the beer selection at all and went to the bar to bring us a list conjured up in some word processing program (not a formal menu).\\n\\nHe dumps this paper on us then disappears.  A few seconds later a different guy, clearly staff, appears and asks if we are ready to order.  We ask for menus and water and he disappears.  Within seconds we get a waitress who asks if she can get our drink order.  The main man orders a Kiltlifter and she zooms away from the table; I have to holler at her that I'd like whatever diet soda they have... This is the first time she seems to even notice I'm there.  My husband is a very handsome man but he isn't Brad Pitt!\\n\\nShe brings the drinks, in two separate trips, and we have to stop her from zipping off again to order.  She seems pretty put out by the fact that we want food off the menu and not just stuff from the Happy Hour app menu.\\n\\nWe get the HH quesadilla, the turkey bacon melt, and the bacon cheeseburger (ordering the cheeseburger should have been a moment where she could have offered the two-for-one burger special but she didn't).\\n\\nThe quesadilla arrives, it looks nice, the tortilla is perfectly grilled, but it's just plain cheese inside.  No seasoning, nothing special.  It is exactly as it reads in the menu and exactly what my 7 year old niece would make if I asked her for a cheese quesadilla.  \\n\\nOur waitress cruises the table and inquires about the quesadilla.  When the man says \\\"it's ok\\\" she responds by asking if he wants another beer (he's not even halfway through the original 16 oz).  When he says no, she zips away agin (I'm out of water and could use a soda refill but she apparently can't be bothered with such trivial matters).\\n\\nThe food arrives and our immediate reaction is WTF????  The turkey bacon melt is made with bacon bits and chopped turkey that falls right out of it the minute he picks it up.  It tastes ok but again, my niece could pull this off...  The burger is damn near slider sized and literally hiding in a bun twice the size of the meat patty.  It had two actual slices of bacon and tasted decent but again no seasoning and it was within my the abilities of my niece.  The fries weren't worth eating, pretty sure they came from a bag in the freezer.\\n\\nAs we are eating, the waitress speeds past and asks how things are and again, the man says \\\"it's ok\\\" and she responds with \\\"want another beer?\\\"  When he says no, she's gone again (still no refills of water or soda).\\n\\nWe finish and pile our dishes and the waitress comes and removes them only now asking if I'd like any refills.  When I respond no, she takes all but one plate and disappears.  And we wait.... And wait...\\n\\nHas anything about our visit indicated we want to spend one more minute in this place?  Our beverages are gone and we have declined more, the food that was edible is gone and we haven't ordered more, by my count, this is when the bill usually arrives.  Nope, we have to wave her down and ask for the bill and she seems genuinely surprised that we want out... She never smiled, she never greeted us, she never refilled beverages (only asking when the man clearly hadn't had enough alcohol for the food to be better than ok and after the meal was over), she never gave us a reason to stay.  \\n\\nNot one thing about our visit gives us a reason to go back.\\n\\nSave yourself the frustration of lackluster service by personnel that look more like biker-bar parolees than professional servers and marginal food.  Go elsewhere, anywhere, but not there.\n\nAnswer:",

I was pretty excited to take her here because of all the hype that I had read, It is unfortunate that it did not live up to it. Let me explain. \\n\\nWe walked in and let the lady working the door know we had reservations and she says no problem let me see what we can do. After a minute or so she asked us to step to the side and sit in a oddly place booth by the front door while we wait. This may seem nit picky but it seems it would be a much nicer sitting/waiting area without the table.. Anyways, we then waited there for between 10 and 15 minutes while watching them seat other parties of 4 or more while we just sat there.. Another lady who I am assuming is a manager or owner was walking around checking on the place and helped clear a table that is on a raised area right when you walk in and then came and seated us. I can deal with waiting to be seated, yes it is irritating when you make a reservation just to find yourself waiting. \\n\\nOnce we were seated it took quite a while for the server to even come to the table to offer drinks or even say hello. All while I am overhearing the older couple sitting right behind us praise who I am assuming was the manager about how awesome his service was. Once we finally ordered our drinks the next thing that caught me off guard was when he walked by and set a brown bag with bread sticks in it on our table. Now, I don't know if that is the regular procedure and if it is, in our opinion which may not mean too much it is very tacky to come to a restaurant selling $25-$30 entree's and be handed a greasy brown bag with bread sticks in it.. \\n\\nSo, now that my kids have breadsticks and are happy that they have some food we are now ready to order and again we waited for an extended amount of time to order and every drink on our table went completely empty. The waiter then came over and we ordered. My son ordered a pizza, my daughter got the alfredo  my wife got the veal marsala and I ordered Filipino chicken adobo... I know that sounds odd but I guess the chef is filipino and has this on the menu. Once the food came I thought it would be the saving grace. My daughters fetticini was grainy but everything else was good, but the part that was odd to me is that the Filipino Adobo dish was by far the best dish at our table... To the point that my wife, the italian food lover took my adobo sauce and put it on her noodles from the marsala because she said the sauce was just ok. \\n\\nSo now we fight the battle of paying the bill, the server came back with the check quite a while after we had finished and I tried to get my card to him quickly and unfortunately he walked away before I could hand it to him so I looked at the bill. $83 for 4 of us with 2 of them being kids.. Kids drinks at a $3 price point each was a little excessive and I although the food was ok it was definitely not worth the $25-$30 price range that is being charged. We sat again for another 25 minutes exactly (yes, we timed it) before the server came back to take our check. Once we paid we filled out the feedback card which I highly doubt made it to management, nobody is going to hand their boss something that says, well the food was just okay and your service was absolutely horrendous. \\n\\nI personally cannot stiff anyone, and this was the first time in my life that I wanted to walk out without leaving any tip. No drink refills and an $83 lunch that took from 12:45 when we walked in the door until 2:50 when we walked out is crazy, I could only imagine if every server in that place was that slow and non attentive they would seat only 4-8 parties at that table all day with an average 2 hour meal time.  I wanted to like this place because the location is great but the bottom line is that even if the food was just ok and not great and they had stellar service I would come back over and over again but with the food being just ok and the service being horrible I know that I will not go out of my way to go back or recommend anyone to go there.\n\nAnswer:",

Its authentic Sichuan Chinese food has drawn so many people to its wonderful central location at State and Gilman. I at least have dined more than 10 times during 2009-2010 and have been constantly happy with its food. Back then, only Wah Kee Noodle was the other \\\"Authentic\\\" Chinese place on my radar. \\n\\nBut you know, restaurants are precarious business. \\n\\nSince 2009, there has been a revolution in the Chinese food scene in Madison. I can count almost 10 new authentic Chinese restaurants joining the competition. Ichiban, Oriental House, Double 10, Dumpling Haus, Hong Kong Station, to name a few. Fugu was no longer unique, and I have settled with Ichiban for Sichuan food in the past couple of years. \\n\\nEarlier this week, I went back to Fugu and was totally disappointed. The dining space was under-staffed with only two people handling 50 people. Through the whole time of our dinner, servers never had time to clean up dirty dishes left by previous customers. When we left, the restaurant was full of empty tables with dirty dishes. A group of people came but was unable to be seated. So they left. It was ugly. Plus, there were flies accompanying our dinner. \\n\\nWe had 5 dishes, but they slowly came during a 30-mins period. The fast and accurate service was gone. \\n\\nFood was good but inconsistent. Water-boiled beef and Tofu Fish were really good, but somehow our stirred fried pea shoot, the easiest and overpriced dish of all, was messed up. Too much salt. \\n\\nMy experience sounds really bad, but I tend to think it was an anomaly rather than the standard. Therefore I gave it a 3 star instead of 2. But for while, I don't think I am going back. There are much better choices if you are not limited to the State st area.\n\nAnswer:",

Needless to say I've never been on a helicopter and was extremely excited to experience this. Upon receiving my deal I immediately made a phone call to the company to make my appointment. I called them on a Saturday and ended up scheduling for a Tuesday. The phone call wasn't all that pleasant but it wasn't bad either. That is literally three days in between. We show up for our appointment 10 minutes early and the doors are locked, lights on, the place is a mess and looks to have been cleared out and left in a hurry. We circled the parking lot looking for an agent, we tried calling several times with a busy tone every time, and everyone we asked had no idea where the Heli USA workers were at. We finally got help from a very nice lady in the Aviation building who told us that several other individuals had come through there asking the same questions we were and it seems the company had just vanished. Good thing I paid my money to Living Social, otherwise I'm sure I would have completely lost out on getting a refund.\\n\\nWhat makes me more upset is that on a Saturday this woman did not have the decency of a human being to let us know that things with the company are not going well, or even to give us a heads up and say wait until Monday to make an appointment.

I was expecting it to be campy, and it was, but there also was a good amount of production involved in the live music show.  \\n\\nThere were several other acts (hoop dancer, magic show, gun fight) going on through the evening that each performer venue directed the crowd to (and kept the night moving), but the real gem here is the main music show.  \\n\\nI'm amazed that this family is still doing their show, and it is incredible.  A musician myself, I'm usually leery of such acts, but their band had a magnetic energy (and playful onstage banter), Big Jim and Sweet Mary can still SANG and their fiddler rivals the speed of light!  Very tight harmonies, a medley of moving patriotic songs & spirituals, and a healthy amount of crowd interaction.  \\n\\nThe band serves you through the dinner line, engaging visitors when the line lulls.  It is a humbling realization when you see them up on stage after dinner doing their thing.  They ran out of chicken about 2/3 of the way through the line and gave out ice cream vouchers to those people.  However, even without the chicken, they fill your plate.  I did not leave hungry.  \\n\\nI bought 2 vouchers through BuyWithMe for \\\"2 VIP tickets for a barbecue buffet, ice cream, and high-energy stage show\\\" for $40 (so, $20/person).  According to their website that should include \\\"VIP Seating / Includes Chicken and Beef Combo Meal\\\" and costs $36 per person.  What actually happened: it was not a buffet, but cafeteria style - one run through, one serving of each.  We did not receive ice cream vouchers with our dinner tickets, and did not receive VIP seating, unless if everyone else used the same VIP seating vouchers, and we were just four rows back in the VIP seating (out of five rows total).  So, that was disappointing.  I don't think it's worth the full admission price.  I enjoyed it, yes, but, even for the novelty of the show, I'd cap the adult price at $20.\\n\\nOverall, though, it's a good place to bring the kids.  They successfully recreated a completely different era for children (and adults) to lose themselves in, and get some history at the same time.  There is a lot of standing for acts other than the dinner/stage show, so not the best option for older folks or those with back problems.  Also, you'll enjoy it more if you choose a cooler month - only the stage show/dinner is inside.\\n\\nMy final word?  It was worth the voucher price and was a nice alternative to the standard dinner and a movie.  If I go again and bring the kids, we'll pop in just for the dinner/show and leave afterwards.\n\nAnswer:",

This has previously been one of my favorite go to spots on the weekend, and I used to think of it as the perfect place to end the night.  However, it has gone downhill over the past few months, and after several horrible customer service experiences I do not think I will be frequenting this establishment again.  Let me be specific....If you mess with my money - and do so consistently and without apology...then I will not return, and I will be sure to tell as many people as I can, regardless of how \\\"fun\\\" your bar might be.\\n\\nA few months ago, I went to Mulligans, and when ordering my drink, I asked them to just leave a tab open and handed them my card.  I ended up ordering one more beer, and then closed my $9 tab at the end of the night.  The next day after checking my bank account, I was astonished to see a $50 hold on my account from Mulligans.  I immediately called them to inform them of the error, but was told, pretty rudely, that it was standard procedure for them to hold $50 for any opened tab, and that it would just \\\"fall off\\\" in a few days at my bank...nothing else they could do.   They did tell me that there was a small sign on the bar that mentioned this policy, and that I should have read it first (because that's apparently what people look for or notice when they go to the bar).  Furiously, I waited for 5 business days for the funds to become available again.\\n\\nA month or so later, I went in again.  Same situation, same low dollar bill, same $50 hold...although this time I just kicked myself for not remembering it the first time.  I did call the manager to ask if there was a way to avoid this other than paying cash (which I never carry), and was told that if I had closed my account after each drink rather than keep an open tab, I would just be charged for the actual dollar amount owed each time.  Good to know (although also a huge pain in the butt).\\n\\nFlash foward to last week.  I went to Mulligans again, this time for St. Patricks Day.  Based on my previous conversation with the manager, I was confident that if I just closed out my tab each time, I would be fine.  I ordered one beer (specialty for $3 dollars), and closed out.  Later that night I went back and ordered two more beers (total, $6) and closed out.  The next day, I checked my account.....and found that there were TWO holds on my account from Mulligans, for $25 each.\\n\\nI immediately called again and explained the situation.  The person on the phone immediately started in on their \\\"policy\\\" to hold funds when there is an open tab.   I told him that I had been aware of that , and that is why I closed out each time...So why I was being \\\"held\\\" $50 for a total of $9 was a mystery to me (and I was seriously regretting the tip at this point).  He stated \\\"well,  the best I can tell you is to just wait for it to drop off, there's nothing we can do\\\".  I told him that was not an acceptable solution to me, and he interrupted to say sarcastically \\\"you really need to take this up with someone else...I'm just the barback\\\".  So I asked him to take down my phone number and have the manager call me that night.  He took on an incredibly rude and sarcastic tone, and said (overenthusiastically)   \\\"absolUTELY!!   I would LOVE to do that for you\\\".  I ignored the tone and gave him my phone number anyway, and again requested that the manager call me that night.  He replied \\\"ABSOLUTELY\\\" again in his rediculous tone, and then hung up on me.  I never heard from the manager.\\n\\nThis is incredibly poor customer service, a poor way to handle your customer's money, and a really EASY way to lose business.  By the way, it's 4 days later and the funds are still being held.  This is a recession people, I go places with cheap beer for a reason!  And I can guarantee you there are a million other places to go in Scottsdale that serve $3 beers and don't do it while stealing from your pocketbook (even if it IS supposedly temporary).  I suggest staying away from this place unless you like to have your money taken and you enjoy rudeness.\n\nAnswer:",

It's an older airport so it shows its age, but since Vegas attracts tourists from all walks of life from all over the world, it's a great place to people watch between flights. My favorite is to watch when people get off a plane from, say, Newark, and then they head straight for the in-airport slot machines. Only in Vegas.

I've been by their building a hundred times but never knew they were located there since they're on the 2nd floor.\\n\\nThe inside is small but bright and clean. I was taken care of right away. Diana did my brows and did a great job. She asked me what I was looking for, examined my brows, and went to work. I was in and out in 15 minutes. She also filled them in for me as well before I left.\\n\\nI am a threading convert. It's so much quicker and cleaner. I'll definitely be coming back the next time I need some shaping work.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm so glad I found Le Grand Comptoir on yelp! It's exactly how the entire 2 reviewers described it. It's not intimidating, the prices are reasonable, the waiters are friendly, the portions are substantial. I ordered the pork tenderloin and it's soooo tender!!! It came with a creamy mustard sauce.

Patio was full but inside it was half empty.  Got seated immediately.  I knew it was a tourist trap but even with that I was surprised how bad the service and food was.  Had to beg for our (mediocre) chips and salsa.  After 20 minutes of not getting our drinks this time I called for a manager.  He told us that our server got tied up with a large group.  I guess our group of 7 was not large enough.  Finally after asking him for our drinks he went and got them.  Having ordered a $7 draft Coors Light he brings that back 3/4 full *sigh*.  \\n\\nAt this point, we just want to get our food and hope it's at least decent for the outrageous prices they charge.  Nope...wrong.  I ordered a steak soft taco and steak enchilada.  If you like the $2 steak tacos at Taco Bell then you would like these.  Seriously, I couldn't taste the difference.  Out of 7 dishes, only 1 person said their food was actually good.\\n\\nContinuing on with the bad service after waiting to get our check, we all added up our totals.  We were in the process of leaving our bad tip (sorry I usually tip well but this was terrible, un-apologetic, bad service) when a different (new) server comes out and asks if she can see the check because she believes she needed to add something to our bill.  Yeah right...\\n\\nI know the patio has a nice people/fountain view but avoid this place if you can.  I love Sammy Hagar but he failed especially with this place.\n\nAnswer:",

If your prices were also micro, I would understand it but I should not be paying $25 for a 4oz cut of steak...sirloin in a bowl of duck broth over risotto. \\n\\nThis combination stank so the small portion is forgivable but what are you thinking putting a steak in a stew bowl, on top of a bowl of risotto and covering the whole thing with duck broth. First, the broth tastes nothing like duck but why would you add liquid to risotto after spending all that time getting the liquid to rice ratio just perfect? Or maybe it never was and this was your way of masking the problem?  The risotto may be astounding but adding the broth turned it to glue. So, the meal as described v. the meal I received, I didn't care for. But, my meal was a delight after I tasted my friend's meal of mussels. The mussels were terrible and I thought had gone bad from the taste...So, not good for dinner. \\n\\nYour brunch on the other hand was tasty but the portions were nuts. $11 for ala carte french toast and I get slivers of bread....seriously?! You are in Chandler not Beverly Hills and you are waiting on working class folks, not starlets so put some food on my plate!  \\n\\nOverall, Cork, you are beautiful, you know that but you really need to turn it up in the kitchen because I would recommend you for drinks but never for substance...\n\nAnswer:",

I gave them a prescription on Saturday only to be told that they did not have the medicine in, that I would have to wait until Monday. Monday rolls around, no call. I called them and was told it still wasn't ready when I questioned why not I was put on hold. The male pharmacist told me I just got it in I'll have it ready in 20 mins. That call took place at approximately 10:30am, I arrived to pick up my prescription close to 5pm only to be told that they couldn't fill it because they couldn't read the doctors handwriting. When the Pharmacy manager called me he apologized for the mis-communication however we would not be able to order the medicine if it wasn't in stock if we couldn't read the prescription. I let him know that I didn't magically pull that answer out of no where and was offended that he would even imply that I did. He wanted to know if I had a name. I asked him how many times does his staff introduce themselves when a customer pulls up to the drive thru window, because none ever had to me. He said they should I said they don't and that would be a good place to start. I let him know that asking me an open ended question like what would you like for us to do is ridiculous, what can you do for me other than fill my prescription. My account had no notation regarding the medicine not being in stock. I let him know that the first time a pharmacists is handed a prescription they should begin to take ownership until that customer is leaving with their medicine in hand, and that they should take better care when noting their customers accounts. The managers lax attitude left me frustrated as I told him they get their direction from him and that his customer service skills were piss poor so theirs would be also. No care and concern at all. I will take my business else where.\n\nAnswer:",

I asked them to please fade it better and the girl butchering his hair said she didn&apos;t know how and had another woman help. It took 2 of them and still my poor son looked like a fool.

The place is certainly the \\\"old school\\\" dinner other more recent restaurant incarnations try to imitate but fail.  In a word \\\"charming\\\".  The place however could use a little bit (ok a lot!) of touch up.  From the raggedy wine coloured rug, to the creaky tables and frayed curtains - it is very obvious that St. Lucia is in the business of frequent clientele turnover (good luck finding a table during lunchtime - thanks to the crush of business people at that time)\\n\\nService:  The service at Santa Lucia varies depending on the time of arrival.  Evenings (3pm and up) tend to find the restaurant almost desolate - and thus the staff (one / two people) being very attentive.  Being popular with the business crowed due to its menu and close proximity to many of the businesses in the downtown core - it is very difficult to get a seat (or grab anything to go) during lunch time, so the staff is understandably rushed and brief during those times.\\n\\nFood:  You will find many a Montrealer who swears by Santa Lucia's pizzas, pasta dishes and Italian sausages, however for the prices charged the food's quality is not something to write home about (but worth a Yelp review!).  Pizzas and calzones are cooked in a stone hearth / oven which gives them an added dash of flavour (watch out, sometimes these are made \\\"more-oily-than-necesarry\\\") and some pastas are even made from scratch.  Dishes are served hot, and Santa Lucia makes a great carrot cream soup.\\n\\nSanta Lucia is best for pickup and for when no other places remains open - its quaint charm is slowly fading (along with the paint) however due to lack of up keep.\\n\\nNote: It is located directly adjacent to the Che Pare strip club and La Boom nightclub.  Just though you should know!\\n\\nWorth a try when time allows :O)\n\nAnswer:",

Piatto Verde is near the  Fountain Park complex, so slightly more out of the way, but really only a short walk from the west end, and it's worth it for the cash savings.

I remembered hearing about Le Thai, so I went there as a Plan B. Now, it's my new Plan A!\\n\\nI'm not really a Thai food snob (I usually just order pad Thai)...and as anyone who's read my other reviews knows, I rate restaurants more based on their atmo than the food quality, anyway. You can get good food at the f*cking grocery store! If you're PAYING to eat out, you want a cool atmo, to make it worth your while. RIGHT?!\\n\\nLe Thai has a very cool atmo. It's cute and teeny-tiny -- so cute and teeny-tiny you almost expect it to start shooting ping pong balls out its....well, you know! About 1/2 is in the front room, and the other 2/3 is in this really cool sort of beer-garden-ish courtyard-type room. VERY cool!\\n\\nThe windows in the front room look out onto Fremont St. East, so depending on the time of day you can either watch winos and crackheads shuffling down the sidewalk, or drunk-ass college girls stumbling out of Insert Coins across the street. (I recommend the early show... the late show is old news. Although one of my fave things about this joint is that it's open til LATE -- midnight during the week, and 2am on weekends.)\\n\\nI went here for lunch, and had a bowl of tofu pad thai, a 4 on the spiciness scale of 1-5.

We go there even more recently, now that his parents and siblings are hooked.  His mom was a missionary in Korea when she was younger, so she introduced her family to this style of food when they were young.  They LOVE the kimchi, bulgogi, and bibimbop (sorry if those are mispelled).  His mother says their food is the closest to the food she had when in Korea.  One thing they said they would appreciate, is for each person who orders one of the dishes that comes with the kimchi to get their own portions of them.\\nI'm a fan of the sushi. Some of it is pretty pricey, but most of it is reasonable.  We also love the crab rangoon.  It's easy to share with a group because it's made differently than anywhere else I've been.  The crab/cream cheese filling is actually served in a dish as a dip.  The fried pastry is cut in triangles, like chips!  \\nI don't like that the chairs feel cheap and unstable (think ikea) and the tables are tight for 6 tops.  They have them set that way, so I know we weren't just put at a 4 top with more chairs.  \\nMy other complaint is that the food takes FOREVER!!  Don't get me wrong, it is ALWAYS good, but it should be served in a timely fashion!  Last time we were there, there were maybe 3 or 4 other tables there and it took about 45 minutes to get our food...and they only brough 4 of the 6 of us our food at that time...the other 2 people got their food another 15 minutes later!

Had Yakisoba, and several rolls; did not try any of their sashimi, because it seemed really expensive (4 pc. Sake Sashimi for $9).  We quickly realized why the rolls were cheaper: because there isn't much fish in them.  The fish on the rainbow roll we got  was sliced so thin, it was hard to tell how quality the fish was.  The rice to fish ratio was ridiculous, leaving with me mostly full, but unsatisfied.\\n\\nWe were warned before ordering that they were pretty busy, and we should put our sushi order in quickly.  While I appreciate the warning, I don't think AN HOUR AND A HALF is an acceptable waiting time with or without warning.  The Yakisoba we ordered came out promptly, but after finishing it, we waited another full hour for the sushi.\\n\\nOverall I feel they are overpriced for what you get, and the food is not exactly worth the wait.  Not bad by any means, but not worth dealing with the price/service.\n\nAnswer:",

We were told they were out of brisket. After waiting in line about 35 minutes we placed our order- 5 two-meat combos- all pulled chicken and tri-tip. Once we got to the counter for them to fill our order they then told us they were out of tri-tip and that it'd be a few minutes for the next batch to be done. They put our ticket aside as we waited. Tri-tip was done- but then they proceeded to fill singleton orders that came in behind ours, forgetting about our order. So now- no more tri-tip... again. Then they said brisket would be ready in a few minutes- we waited. After another LONG 45 minute wait, we were once again told that they were now out of brisket. Are you SERIOUS? I sighed and the man (\\\"Slick\\\" they call him) behind the counter could sense my frustration.

This was the first time that the same person made salads and they were drastically different.  I met someone here for an early dinner/first date and spent time talking and getting to know each other. The restaurant was not busy and provided a good setting for a meeting. After about an hour, we made our way to the line and ordered salad. \\n\\nThe soup maven had to go in the back and fetch the salad lady. My date ordered Greek salad with no onions and no olives, but add chicken. The lady struggled with the successful completion of this challenging  order. She started to add onions until my friend stopped her - then she started to add the olives, again being foiled. She neglected to add the chicken until reminded. My friend's bowl was about half full when completed. She made her way down the line when the salad lady asked for my order. I stuck with an Asian chicken salad (no substitutions or alterations), but then she discovered no tongs - so into the back she went and emerged three minutes later. When completed, I had a heaping bowl of salad. \\n\\nBy this time my date already hit the register, paid for her own salad, picked up the drink and sat down to begin eating. Normally I would have paid for both meals, but the salad delay thwarted my chivalrous attempt... My check out was uneventful and I joined her at the table.\\n\\nAnother issue with the restaurant was the temperature. I can appreciate that this is Arizona and you need AC, but it isn't that hot out now. The temperature must have been set for the dog days of August in the Deep South. It was chilly and she was noticeable cold and shaking. That made for uncomfortable eating and conversation (I am sure it wasn't my company). She finished most of the salad and I maybe hit half before deciding to leave and head for warmer ground. \\n\\nI know it is a small treat, but the signature item at Paradise Bakery is the chocolate chip cookie. It is a bakery after all. Try the 2 for 1 cookie, stuff your face with a few bites of each free sample or take home a dozen. They are definitely worth it and provide an excellent happy finish to an otherwise healthy meal.\\n\\nA little more consistency on the salad portions, some fine tuning of the timeliness with the salad preparations and a reasonable temperature would have made the evening more enjoyable.\n\nAnswer:",

The to die for desserts were a masterpiece of perfection in taste and presentation especially the chocolat coulant. This restaurant has again established Montreal as the gourmet capital of Canada and for that we thank you Daniel. Bienvenue a Montreal !!!\n\nAnswer:",

Search no further because Fausto's is that place plus more. The employees are nice, the food is made-to-order, the menu is simple and inexpensive, and there's a complimentary condiments bar complete with pickled veggies (jalapenos, carrots & onions), fresh cucumber & radish slices, and two types of salsa (mild tomatillo & a spicy red salsa). Sure, the ambiance may be lacking, but that's okay because you can just order your food to-go. You can order food a la carte (located on the menu above the counter) or you can order a combo which comes with an entree and sides of Mexican-style rice & refried beans. The combo menu is posted on the side wall adjacent to the counter, and it is composed of images of the food, making it easier to choose what you want to eat. I've been here multiple times, and everything that I have ordered so far has been good. Here's what I've ordered:\\n\\nChimichanga combo plate: A humongous flour tortilla burrito stuffed with shredded beef, onions & bell peppers, then fried to golden perfection and topped with sour cream on one half & guacamole on the other, along with a nice layer of melted cheese. The plate comes with a side of rice & refried beans, as well as a small serving of pico de gallo ( I assume to bring some sort of healthy to the dish). \\n\\nShredded Beef combo plate: The shredded beef is the same concoction as the shredded beef inside the chimichanga, but instead of it being encased in a fried tortilla, the meat is served all by itself with sides of refried beans & rice, and your choice of freshly made corn or flour tortillas, which you can use to make mini burritos. The tortillas are wrapped in foil to keep warm. I prefer the flour tortillas over the corn because they have better texture, are bigger & taste better. Store-bought flour tortillas can't compare to the fresh-made tortillas at Fausto's. \\n\\nSuper Nachos: Heart-attack on a plate! But so addicting & super good. I usually ask for the toppings (meat of your choice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes & cheese; I may be forgetting something) on the side to prevent the fried flour tortilla chips from becoming soft. The chips are oily and they layer on the toppings, so be warned- Addicting, yet so bad for you. \\n\\nTacos: I love the tacos because of the way Fausto's prepares the shell. I think they fry the whole taco after stuffing the tortilla with meat & cheese, resulting in a very crispy shell. They then take the fried taco and add lettuce & a another type of cheese (crumbly, reminiscent of feta). I like to add salsa to the taco, which makes the taco juicy & yummy. \\n\\nI haven't had a bad experience with Fausto's yet, so I do recommend this place. The next time you're searching for good Mexican food at inexpensive prices and large portions, then stop by Fausto's and try some of their menu items.\n\nAnswer:",

We ordered the garlic crab and the garlic noodles. The waiter brought out to us a crab shell stuffed with crab meat and it tasted nothing like either of their places back in the City. I was floored! There's nothing like craking your own crab. Plus it was a tad bit more expensive. The location was nice, though.

Check-in service was painless albeit it was a weekend day afternoon and not very busy.\\n\\nWe were really impressed by the ambience of the hotel room (resort room with a view of the Strip). The modern decor matched our tastes. There was a flat screen tv with a Bose wave sound clock radio.  The bed, covered with plush pillows and fresh linens, was comfortable. The bathroom was great - two vanity sinks with an integrated tv (which had bad reception), enclosed granite shower, a bathtub with a view of the Strip (and a electronic privacy shade if you desire). Complementary cards were included in the suite. Maid service was excellent.\\n\\nUse of the fitness area costs $15 and internet costs $13/day which seemed rather pricey to me. I'll post a pic of the spa prices (note: they charge you a mandatory 20% gratuity!).\\n\\nThe amenities include use of the pool area which was lovely. We enjoyed lazing around the pool all afternoon like two slugs. It was awesome! The crowd there is diverse - you see kids in their lifejackets, the elderly sunning next to their wheelchairs and the young 20 somethings sporting designer shades and swimwear. The music is top 20's with some pop favourites from the 80's. Fortunately, the music was at a comfortable decibel level.\\n\\nThe casino itself was quiet during our weekday vacay and was relatively smoke free for a casino. Also really like they didn't pump some yucky perfume in the ventilation system like other casinos on the Strip. Loved the free beverage fountain next to Marinelli's which wasn't watered down! (they had Fresca! I love Fresca!)\\n\\nDisadvantages: well, if you don't gamble, go to the spa, lounge in the pool or check out Tina Martini- there isn't much here to do unlike other local casinos which have movie theatres and bowling alleys. \\n\\nThe location is another factor to consider because there really isn't much around the casino - plus it's far from the Strip for visitors. You'll definitely need a car if you stay here.\\n\\nFinally, the food doesn't quite live up to level of quality at the hotel. Compared to other Strip casino hotels which have great restaurants there or nearby, this hotel's food is okay but not great.\\n\\nOverall, a really nice stay and we were glad we came to relax here.

I'm not a big fan of the large chain sporting good stores (Sports Authority, Dick's) & thought this place might be a nice change from those. But I was wrong, this is basically the same type of place, just smaller with bigger prices.\\n\\nThey didn't seem to have a vast selection of anything, because they try to sell everything, if that makes sense. They have footwear, college apparel, tennis rackets, fitness apparel, baseball goods, so on & so on. But by their store being limited in size, trying to sell goods for every single sport leaves you with less room to have a big selection within each category. So the items are watered down & they can't specialize in having unique items for every sport, just your basic goods. But I will say the service here seems friendly & willing to help, even though I wasn't in the buying mood.\\n\\nOmega Sports seems like a locally owned sporting goods store trying to directly compete with the big chain sporting good stores. I hate to say it, but they just seem like a smaller, more run down version of these stores with nothing really intriguing to entice customers away from the big chains. If you're looking for a basic sporting good item they'll probably have what you're looking for, but don't expect a vast selection of things.\n\nAnswer:",

It does need to be improved, but it is a good addition to the city, and I can't wait until they expand it so I can use it to get to more places. \\n\\nPositives:\\n-Convenience. I happen to live close to a station and work close to a station, so it doesn't get any easier than that. Even if you don't happen to live near a station, there are several Park & Ride stations for you to leave your car and take the train uptown for a night out, a performance, or a game. \\n-In general, the trains are clean, well-kept, well-lit, and not too crowded. I feel safe taking it and waiting by myself at the stations.\\n-For the most part the trains run on-schedule at reasonable intervals. \\n\\nRoom for improvement:\\n-The stations provide absolutely no weather coverage. Have you ever missed your train? Because I have more times than I'd like to admit, and have been stuck waiting for the next one in the rain. Yes, I was under the awning, but the awning doesn't do anything. Even the large covering at the Uptown CATS station leaves much to be desired. \\n-The trains need to run later hours, at the very least on the weekend. This is not just for the party crowd either. I work in a restaurant that closes at 11 on the weekends, and sometimes servers don't get out until almost 2 am, especially if they're closing. Sucks for you if the last train left at 1 am. There are groups of people besides the 9-to-5ers that depend on the CATS system to work the night shift.\\n-Trains need to be scheduled better when there are events uptown. Panthers game? Concert at Time Warner? Street festival? SCHEDULE MORE TRAINS. And run a double-length instead of a single-length. I have seen a little bit of effort regarding this, but many a time I am just trying to get home from work and get stuck behind 7,000 kids who just got out of Disney on Ice (see my review for Vida Cantina.)\n\nAnswer:",

The Half-and-Half (Arnold Palmer) was terrific and refillable.  The Meatloaf was incredible as well, there are so many layers of flavor.  It takes all the things you like about meatloaf and amplified them, while removing the things you don't like.  The Meatloaf sits on two extra thick slices of buttered Texas toast.  The final addition is a thick layer of cheese on top of the meatloaf, forming a cheese skirt on the side.  I said cheese skirt, people.  This is reminiscent of the legendary Squeeze Inn in Sacramento or Napa Valley.\\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese, though highly recommended by the waitress (who claimed to be a M&C aficionado), was alright.

We were seated in the back part of the restaurant and given menus. Joel and I decided we would share our dishes since we wanted to try the same things. We waited probably 15 minutes and no one had come by. No drink order, nothing. The waiter and waitress continued to walk right by us and not even look at us. Finally when the waiter walked by I asked him if we could order. He said \\\" our waitress was really busy that's why she hadn't come by, but that he would take our order.\\\" I ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice with an egg on top at a level 3. Joel ordered his favorite, Pad See Ew with pork at a level 2. The food took a lot longer then expected. I was hungry and wished we'd ordered an appetizer. I started noticing other tables that had come in after us getting their food. Weird. Finally out came our order! Mine was very tasty. It had chunks of short rib and the spice level was perfect. Next time I wouldn't spend the extra $1.50 for the egg on top. I was expecting it to be runny so I could mix it into the rice, but that egg was hard as a rock and did nothing for the dish. Joel's Pad See Ew was more broccoli then noodles, but still had a great flavor. \\n\\nThe decor is very minimum, but they do need to kick the heat lamps down a bit. We were sweating up a storm and not just from the spicy food. I had high hopes for Le Thai, but with that service I'll spend my money somewhere else downtown. Sorry Le Thai you lost me.\n\nAnswer:",

We arrived at about 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon, pleased to see so many cars parked in the lot. The place is divided into separate rooms for dining and for a bar area. We went into the eating area and waited, and waited, but no one ever came. The one couple who were eating said to just take a table and the waitress would be in. After more waiting,a group of 5 entered the eating area. They were immediately seated, given menus, and had their drink orders taken. The waitress never acknowledged that we were present, carefully putting her back to us when she waited in the other people. \\nThere are too many other great places in Vegas to tolerate this.

First let me say,I do not understand how this place even rated as a supposed 4 star hotel in Las Vegas.\\n\\nWhen we first got here the line up for checking in was so long that I was embarrassed with my staff. Okay now off to the room. Maybe we can start over. Wrong!.  The room looked like they were renovated in the 80s. I would say its spacious There was an old air con/fan that made terrible noises every 2 minutes so it was useless.  The blankets are paper thin too and I caught a cold during my third nights stay.  The bathtub is so shallow and old and nasty. I didn't even want to complain because I figured they would only move to a different room with the same amenities. I would have rather stayed in a Comfort suites than this place. We were only there for 2 nights so I did not spend much time in my room. The restaurants that were in the hotel and next to it outside were overall good but nothing spectacular. I will definitely not stay here again. I will stay at The Mandalay but I wonder how does this place stay in the M Life group of Hotels.\\nNeedless to say I am ready to get out of there on Sunday AM and I'm waiting in line again for over 20 minutes to check out.

Rare is the day when you're driving down the road and DON'T see an \\\"Im Addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips\\\" bumper sticker. However, as a native Canadian who has been in the States for over 30 years and Arizona for about 27 years, I had yet to eat fish & chips below the 49th parallel. My husband, a Bay Area transplant, had a hankering' for some fish and chips and thought - \\\"what better place to try than the one advertised on many a back bumper?\\\" So off we went in the Ferrari of minivans...\\n\\nMy husband asked how big the pieces of fish were - after all, you could get 4 pieces for under $7 - how big could they be? \\\"About the size of a fish sandwich\\\" said the guy behind the counter. that should have been our first clue.Both of us are used to pieces of fish being of the plate-sized variety.\\n\\nWe didn't get \\\"fish and chips\\\". What we got was a mystery substance covered in cracker-meal then flash frozen for God knows how long before it's dropped in grease. EVERYTHING lacked flavor, except for the ketchup+Tapatio known as \\\"Pete's Sauce\\\".  The \\\"shrimp\\\" - like the \\\"fish\\\" - was of questionable origin... about as authentic as the \\\"Rolex\\\" you can get from the guy with the trench coat in New York.

When my friend suggested meeting up at SanTan Village, I wasn't too hopeful I'd find a decent place for us to eat. But we both really enjoyed our meals. There was a 45 minute wait for a table, but we quickly snagged a table in the bar area, which wasn't too loud or busy. I had a really delicious malbec and we both had soup as appetizers - lobster bisque and cream of mushroom. They were both delicious, and after eating the soup and the warm bread and flaxseed crisps they give out free, I knew we were probably in for a good meal. When our entrees came, we weren't disappointed. My friend had a scallop and shrimp eggplant spicy risotto (ok, that's not what it was called, but that's what it was) which was great and I had a ricotta-filled ravioli with vodka sauce - it's supposed to come with prosciutto, but they were nice about subbing mushrooms for me instead, since I'm a vegetarian. We didn't have any room for dessert, unfortunately. All in all, this was a really pretty, tasty, and friendly place for dinner. I'd like to return!\n\nAnswer:",

I went with high expectations because she has told me over and over the past few years how good this place is.\\n\\nI arrived couple minutes after everyone was there and saw that the party (there was about 25 of us) was broken sort of into you, half the party down one side and other wrapped around the middle and the birthday girl was kind of not at either tables, just in the middle of the 2, which made it difficult for conversations to flow, you could talk to your half of the table, but if you want to talk with those on the other side of the restaurant, get up and walk over their then, needless to say, I stayed where I was at and talked amongst my fellow friends on my side, kept giving the bday girl a shout out and drinks to let her know we are here to party! \\n\\nLet's start with the salsa, their where 2 types, a pico de gallo and a hotter blend, which reminded me more of a smoky chipotle sauce.  Well the pico looked great, but had absolutely no flavor, no pepper ,no onion, no tomato flavor, not even the cilantro, which is my favorite ingredient to cook with, had flavor, even if you added salt and pepper to it, it didn't help.  The hotter of the two did have a nice smoky chipotle taste to it, so that was the one I went with it.\\n \\nI went with the filet of Salmon with mango salsa with Spanish rice and black beans.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and even though the top of the fish appeared to have some sort of rub on it, it too was lacking in flavor, I tossed on the mango salsa to see if that would help and sadly it did not, no flavor at all. I topped it with the smoky chipotle to give some sort of flavor and appearance that I'm not eating mush. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, no issues there.  Had this dish had flavor to it, it would have been amazing, but nope it did not.\\n\\nNow like I said we were spilt into 2 along one sided booth table things from one end of the room to the other, and there was apx 25 if not more of us. But by the time my end of the table had gotten their food, the other half was already paying and leaving.  It was not because I was late; I got their in time for orders to be taken. This was poor planning on the server's behalf, half the party had ready left by the time we got our bills.  I was bummed because I was wanting to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and poof she was gone .  I wanted to like this place, but I'm afraid I am a onetime diner here.\n\nAnswer:",

While I liked Yola's family-friendly coffeehouse concept, a series of service missteps and lackluster execution of the food order made for a less than stellar experience.\\n\\nWhile waiting for my wife to arrive, my daughter and I hungrily spied the butterscotch and chocolate chip scone in the display case on the front counter.  We recently basked in the glory that is the oatmeal butterscotch cookie from Batch Bakehouse and hoped Yola's would provide us with a west-side fix for our new butterscotch addiction.  Alas, it was not to be.  The scone was overly dry and lacked the richness of the scones from the aforementioned Batch.  \\n\\nWhen my wife arrived, there were a steady stream of customers pouring into the caf\\u00e9.  After a short wait, a rather stoic gentleman took our order.  He did not greet us, hardly smiled and did not offer any recommendations as we made our picks from the menu.  Frankly, it was a little awkward.  I did score the free 16 oz. coffee offered with a Yelp check-in (thank you, Yelp!).  When we finished ordering, my wife and daughter each asked for a cup of water, which also drew a blank expression from our stoic friend.\\n\\nWe took our number and trudged off to a table, which the party at the neighboring table was using to discard their dirty dishes.  All the unoccupied tables had dirty dishes and were in desperate need of a good wipe down.\\n\\nAfter a short wait, stoic dude arrived with my daughter's fruit cup.  At the counter, stoic dude told us the fruit cup contained strawberries, blueberries and pineapple.  What we received was a cup full of cantaloupe and honeydew (which my daughter is not a fan of).  To their credit, when I pointed this out, stoic dude took it back and we later received a large cup brimming with ripe strawberries, pineapple and grapes.\\n\\nAfter another short wait, my wife and I received our sandwiches.  However, my daughter and I did not receive our drinks and nor did we receive our water.  So I trudged back to the counter, only to see a long line of customers waiting to order.  While waiting in line, I noticed a water cooler that stoic dude failed to mention when we ordered our food.  So I filled a couple of cups with water and trudged back to the table.  Still no beverage order.  So I trudge back to the counter to check on the status of the drinks.  Still a long line, so I wait...and wait...and wait.  Finally, I get to the front of the line.  I ask stoic dude about my coffee.  He instructs me to grab a coffee cup from behind the coffee carafes.  C'mon stoic dude, you could have mentioned that when we ordered.  So I grab a cup with high hopes that my beverage odyssey was about to end.   Curses, foiled again, the carafe is empty.  After a short wait, the owner finally indicates they are brewing more coffee.  So I trudge back to the table and take a bite of my now cool egg sandwich.  Then the owner indicates the carafe has been filled.  So you guessed it, I trudge up to the counter and fill my mug.  I inquire about my daughter's beverage.  The owner indicates he is working on it.  A minute later, stoic dude delivers the caramel apple drink.  It is lukewarm and tasted like Juicy Juice apple juice with a faint hint of caramel.\\n\\nFor what it's worth, the robust Yola's dark roast is one fine cup of coffee.\\n\\nI finally start eating the rest of my now cold egg sandwich.  While I like the concept of serving the sandwich on a ciabatta roll, the crust was too soft and did not offer much flavor.  The sandwich was small, slightly larger than an English muffin.  The smoked bacon was paper-thin and did not provide much flavor or texture.  The egg was under-seasoned and by the time I finally ate my sandwich, the greens were warm and mushy.  In retrospect, I should have asked to have the sandwich replaced after my long beverage ordeal.\\n\\nOther observations:\\n* The wi-fi signal at Yola's is excellent.\\n* The tables are densely packed, making the constant journeys to the front counter an inconvenience for you and your neighbors. \\n* On the table, there was a list of interesting beverage specials, including a salted caramel chai (yum).  The problem: I didn't see the list until after I made my order.  They really need to post this list by the front counter in a more conspicuous manner.\\n\\nSo, would I go back - maybe, but definitely not at peak service hours.  I do love a good malted waffle, the signature dish of Yola's.  However, if I see stoic dude behind the counter, I am making a beeline for the exit.\n\nAnswer:",

If this was a normal restaurant I would give it 3 stars (entirely because of the feeling like we were a burden, the food was great), but the value vs others around make it a 4 for me.\n\nAnswer:",

It reminds me of restaurants I would frequent back home in San Francisco. I found it to be a very cool spot with friendly, efficient bartenders and servers, diverse (yet relevant) menu and handsome architecture. I love the open airy-ness about the restaurant and the combination indoor-outdoor bar area.  The brick oven is impressive, the wines are exciting and the food is phenomenal.  Everything is very reasonably priced, including drinks.  Parking is valet-only, but it's complimentary. St. Francis is the perfect place for drinking wine with friends, and has definitely been added to my happy hour rotation.  It also strikes me as a great \\\"date\\\" spot. Not that I'm in any danger of needing to be concerned about that. \\n\\nFor as cool as this spot is, nobody there seems to be up their own a$$ about it. The ever-increasing cloud of smug I've noticed in Phoenix has definitely passed over St. Francis.\n\nAnswer:",

I think we came here at the wrong time. We got seated and it took a while to get drinks and order taken (about 10-15 minutes). We finally got to order our coffee but we received without a creamer. The gentleman mentioned he would be back but he did not return. We asked a bus boy for the creamer cleaning the other table and he brought us a dirty one with fresh jam all over the bottom. We asked our waiter for another creamer. We both decided to order their eggs benedict (I ordered the Florentine and my boyfriend ordered the crab).The Florentine was the worst I have ever had. The eggs were sloppy and the asparagus was small cut up piece. I almost sent it back because I thought the asparagus was missing. I am a big fan of eggs florentine and I was surprised to not see fresh asparagus. The asparagus looked like cut up pieces of artichoke hearts. Our English muffins were overly buttered and took away from the meal. My boyfriend didn't finish his crab benedict. It was salty and the overly buttered muffin didn't help. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing here today. The coffee was the best thing about our meal.\n\nAnswer:",

There was already a good size crowd waiting to get in. We were seated right away and service was fairly quick (total lunch took about an hour, not too bad for sit-down service). \\n\\nSince it was a work lunch, we couldn't have any beer or wine. they have 3 options: Coke, diet Coke or sweet tea (all bottles). No fountain drinks at all. That was fine by me, water is cheaper. It is worth noting that the beer they have on tap (Thunder Head or something ) is REALLY tasty and VERY hard to find anywhere else. It's available next door at Bar Bianco.\\n\\nThey only have 6 pizza options and 6 additional topping options. If you want fruit or something on your pizza, you better go somewhere else, because that's not what they do. \\n\\nI had the Rosa pizza, with parmegiano reggiano, red onions and pistachios. it was quite good, but not amazing. Two friends had the margherita pizza and one had the one with fennel sausage. One friend LOVED his margherita pizza but hated mine; I had a piece of his and thought it was bland. The guy who had the sausage pizza found it to be so-so. I always thought they got a little crazy with the sausage. It's pretty strong tasting stuff, you should go easy on it.\\n\\nAfter lunch, don't expect dessert. They don't have any. They do have a huge coffee machine, so you can have your espresso or cappuccino. \\n\\nIf you come at dinner time, be prepared to wait. You can make reservations for 6 or more, but you have to do that weeks in advance. \\n\\nHonestly, no matter what you've heard, this is NOT the best pizza in the Valley. La Grande Orange does it as well or better, plus they have more topping options and are more than happy to give you a half and half pizza. This place is a little snooty. My friend had a salad and wanted to add the fennel sausage to it (he's on a protein diet). They said the sausage is for the pizza only! Really??\\n\\nSo, if you really want to try it, go right ahead and make up your own mind. Maybe come at lunch time. Not nearly as busy and it has all the same food (unlike Cibo, which has a different menu at dinner). But you would probably be happier at Cibo or La Grande Orange. Both make awesome pizza with more options and are way more friendly about it.\n\nAnswer:",

We showed up around 6 on a weeknight and the place was pretty empty. Strangely, we weren't greeted by anyone when we came in, and we weren't sure if that meant we were supposed to wait or seat ourselves, so we waited and felt awkward about it. After about a minute and a half, one of the servers came out and noticed us standing there so he refilled someone's water and then showed us to our table.\\n\\nThe service was fine, no real complaints there. We ordered the Grapes, Arugula, and Ricotta Flatbread for the appetizer. For the entrees we ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy and the Chicken Parmigiana. The flatbread had great flavors, but it was seriously unwieldy. I admit that I can, at times, be coordinationally-challenged... but in my defense this was a piece of flatbread that had grapes and candied walnuts sitting on it, with no sharp knife to cut it into pieces. We ended up with a lot of sticky balsamic glaze on our hands, and I personally got a couple of grapes and walnuts in my lap and on the floor. So that was fun. \\n\\nHer Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich was good. Though in my opinion the small garnish salad on the side was a little measly looking. My Chicken Parmigiana was kind of crazy. The chicken itself was this massive flattened piece of chicken that covered almost the entire plate. I have never seen a piece of chicken like this, I wish I had taken a picture. Anyway, it was breaded and fried, and then set on top of a pile of watery, bland spaghetti. And I mean watery as in, when I tipped the bowl, about a quarter cup of water came forth. That was the water that hadn't already absorbed into the bottom of the chicken breading. It was soggy and strange and disappointing. The flavor of the chicken and breading was good, but I couldn't get over the sog factor. The pasta was unappetizing and I couldn't really eat much of it. \\n\\nThe cocktails were nothing to write home about, especially for the price. I got something with \\\"fresh\\\" blueberries in it... and dared to eat one of them. It had no flavor, other than the taste of (possibly) freezer burn.. and the mealy texture that fruit sometimes gets. It was very gross.\\n\\nThe last thing I feel like mentioning just for the sake of being a complainer is that they were playing a collection of popular songs covered by someone on piano/violin. This included Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses, and Unforgiven (I think?) by Metallica. Though there were no vocals in the recording, that didn't stop the guy at the table next to us from rocking out with his best Axl Rose impression. It made for an interesting ambiance, but it wasn't quite my cup o' tea.\\n\\nBottom line, I won't be back, and I won't be recommending it to anyone. I'm not much of a Yelp reviewer but this place has such amazing ratings I was left feeling confused by my experience and thought I should chime in.\n\nAnswer:",

We stood there for a few minutes; no one greeted us, told us they'd be with us soon... no acknowledgment at all.  The sushi bar was practically empty, so we asked loudly if you could seat yourself.  No one replied, so we started walking to the sushi bar.  A girl then came running after us, not to greet us, but to rudely state that the bar wasn't self seating and that there was a wait since the staff was behind.  We then promptly walked out.

My other 2 guests arrived, and ordered a burger, and 2 add ons of pork belly. Here's where it gets murky..one pork belly dish arrived, so we thought it was the two sides combined, then a few mins later, another small side appears, we send it back, because we thought we already had received ours, it turns out, when we get the check he rang us in for 2 pork belly appetizers (received only one app plate) I was trying to eat my ribeye, and explain to the server what had happened, (he seemed super busy, and impatient the whole experience, rushing my friends through their orders.) He took the app that we didn't order, or receive off, thankfully..but still charged us full price for the one we didn't order. The steak was great paired with the remoulade that I'm in love with, the gratin was cold in the middle. Sad. The service was rushed, and towards the end, the hostess approached us, and asked if we, meaning my friend and I would help her move our table, so the band could set up. She looked shocked when I simply replied \\\"no\\\".

We were given a tour although it was difficult to hear what the girl was saying because it was crowded and the acoustics were amplified in the indoor pool area.\\n\\nThere are shower stalls and bathrooms to change in. Parents are welcome to watch their kids from the pool area or in the room next to it with a glass window.\\n\\nThe pool is big and clean, and the temperature of the water was very comfortable. My baby didn't flinch at all when he went in the water. Our instructor was late, so we had a sub for the first few minutes. It was a good introductory lesson and a great way to get kids acclimated with the water. My son had a blast and was a trooper even when they submerged his head. The instructor led our group in fun activities that included toys and nursery rhymes. The session was half an hour long. \\n\\nLike other reviews mentioned, the Front Desk is a little unorganized. I think they should figure out a system where a parent can quickly purchase a snack without waiting ten minutes for the staff to go through the membership paperwork with other parents.\\n\\nWater Wings is worth checking out if you want a nice clean pool where your kids can learn how to swim.\n\nAnswer:",

I rarely go to the doctor but have had regular visits with my OB during my pregnancy and he requested that I receive a vaccine from my PCP... I complied and made the appointment with the last office I had been to, Hatfield. \\n\\nWhen I called to schedule the appointment the girl that I spoke to on the phone was VERY rude, short and seemed to be talking to someone else in the background about something unrelated to my phone call. I gave her all of my insurance information (ID numbers and such) and set a date. I then asked her if my vaccine would be covered by my insurance policy and she bluntly told me that it was my job to find that out, not hers. Fine. \\n\\nOn the day of my appointment I arrived 10 minutes early, and signed in. There were 3 women at the desk when I arrived and not one of them greeted or even acknowledged me upon arrival. I gave them my insurance card and photo id when they finally got to me (I was the ONLY one in the waiting room at the time) and was then told, with a snotty attitude, that I needed to call my insurance and have their doctor added to my list as I had been assigned to another doctor. Again, Fine. \\nI don't mind making a phone call, that I can only assume could have been done LONG before my appointment time, if someone would have had the decency to ask me to do so. They could have easily asked me to make the call prior to my appointment instead of snapping at me in the waiting room 5 minutes prior to my appointment because it wasn't done. (I should also mention that I am new to this insurance plan and had NO IDEA that I was even assigned to a doctor, let alone a doctor that wasn't theirs!!) \\n\\nMy appointment was in the very early morning, so I partially understand the lack of enthusiasm in the office, but after dealing with the front office staff I am fully convinced that their bad attitude is probably an all day type of thing. I was hoping that I could voice my concern to the doctor, but he too was rushed and seemed inconvenienced by my appointment. After seeing the doctor and receiving the ONE vaccine that I had to go through all this trouble for, I was then left to exit the office on my own and was, again, not acknowledged on my way out, even after stopping at the counter to make sure no co-pay was due. \\n\\nI work in the medical field and can tell you first hand that staff like this in any other office would be terminated... It's a shame that an office built upon \\\"family values\\\" hires such unpleasant personnel to be the face of their business.\n\nAnswer:",

So... since it was a warm night, we were outside most of the time waiting for our friends.  We'd go inside occasionally for shots, or some other form of liquor.  This was about 6 months before I'd meet some other Vegas residents that were about 20x cooler, and would never ditch us two girls in the middle of a town we weren't familiar with.  But that's a story for another time... DDS is dirty.  Not in a Scolari's Office kind of way, either... but really deep grit.  My assumption is that it's always so full they can never really take a sponge, broom, or mop to anything (when really what's needed is a pressure-wash head to toe.)  The walls were covered in artwork: drawings, some lovely skilled grafitti, some not so great penned on grafitti, and some just plain rude phrases.  The people were generally pretty cordial to us (I won't kid myself that it wasn't obvious we were vacationers.)  As soon as the sniffly bitchy boy bands were done, I loved it there.  What I did not love, however, was even the name Ass Juice, much less the drink itself.

Super thin.  Whenever our next-door neighbor on our left opened his/her door, it sounded as if someone was trying to break-in our room.  I could also hear housekeeping doing their rounds every single morning (which was relatively early, since we usually woke up sometime around noon).  To make matters worse, there were doors within our room connecting us to both the left and the right.  Each door created a considerably wide, open gap over the carpeted floor.  As a result, it was unavoidable to hear the TV as well as conversations going on, especially in the room to our right.  Noises are definitely amplified rather than muffled within this building.\\n\\nOld doesn't necessarily have to mean dirty - but in the East Tower, unfortunately, the two go hand and hand.  One night, while in bed watching TV, my travel buddy heads to the bathroom.  Seconds later, SLAPSLAPSLAP!  The lovely sound of a huge cockroach being smashed by my friend's slipper.  He disposed of most of it in the toilet, but I came by later and discovered a squashed pair of legs and wings.  If you know me, you know that I hate and absolutely fear roaches.  It's a silly phobia of mine, but nevertheless, still a phobia.  So since then, I'd be on high freak-out alert whenever I was in the room - half expecting one of those monsters to swoop in and attack.  This is the last thing I want or expect to have to deal with on vacation.\\n\\nThe bathtub clogged.  Every.  Single.  Day.  We're only two people (both of whom only took showers), and we definitely weren't using anything that shouldn't go down the drain.  In fact ... half the time my travel buddy used the hotel's toiletries and - without fail - I always used natural / organic hair cleansers (which are actually better for the environment).  So although I cherished that time every day in which I could temporarily free myself of Vegas's dry air, a clogged bathtub was, is and will forever be considered one of the most nasty features to have to endure at any hotel.\\n\\nIf you're reading this and wondering why I didn't \\\"speak up\\\" during the entire trip, here's why:  one check-in, one carry-on, one handbag and a big pile of new things from LV that remained unpacked - all of which were mine. The thought of having to transport everything to another room, especially in the West Tower, was headache-inducing ... because really, do I want to make work for myself while on vacation?  =/\n\nAnswer:",

But you MUST try their Pan Roast and Gumbo.  But if you have to choose only one then try their Pan Roast it's amazing!  I can't find anything like it anywhere else.  It's a hearty stew like dish with your choice of crab, oyster, shrimp, or combo (crab, shrimp, lobster) in a tomato cream sauce with a kick.  Depending on your spice level you can choose from 1-10.  My bf and I usualy go 6-7 and that's about a medium.  And their portions are huge and they don't skimp on the seafood either. We usually order one pan roast and an appetizer and we're stuffed.  Trust me it's enough, we're pretty big eaters.  When we first tried this place we ordered one pan roast and one gumbo then had a ton of leftovers enough for dinner.

Let me begin by saying the talent was incredible, we did not stop laughing the entire time. Food and drinks on the other hand? The WORST. I ordered the premium Moscow Mule and it was incredibly weak and barely carbonated. It tasted as if it was watered down. My friend ordered a raspberry mojito and same story. The mint and raspberries weren't muddled and there was more soda water than necessary, making the drink flavorless. 3 in our group ordered makers mark on the rocks... Those were fine, although it's pretty difficult to screw that drink up. In addition to a cocktail I ordered a water and filtered/tap water is unavailable. You are forced to pay $4 for still Voss- no charge for ice tho HAHA what a joke... Moving on to the food: my dad ordered the gumbo, it was okay but nothing special. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and the lettuce was soggy. The chicken was cold in the center and warm toward the edges... Yuck. My friend had mozzarella sticks and we didn't expect them to be handmade but if they had actually been cooked through- not still cold in the middle-it would have been nice. Another friend had the sliders... Soggy bun, pretty disgusting. We don't expect 5 Star fine dining at an establishment such as this but at least get your timing right when throwing frozen mozzarella sticks in the oven. Bottom line: eat dinner somewhere else and bring a flask... Bar rescue didn't do much but improve aesthetics and still not much of an atmosphere at that.

It was $25 per person and was not worth any of it. We made dinner reservations for 6pm and they told us that it was the last open spot. When we walked in the door it looked empty, we looked at each other and in our heads we were trying to figure what the deal was. I ordered the VA Pork Belly and my wife ordered the Lobster, Crab cake. The presentation I give an A as for the food quality and taste I give it a F. I was looking forward to this appetizer since I saw it online a day earlier. As for the main course we both wanted to get the Prime Rib and our server came over to tell us that they were out of it for rest of the night. Strike 2! We ended up getting the Turkey and Pork wrapped in Bacon. Again, when it came looked great and yet again left us with an empty hopes and wishes. Never again will I go or recommend this place to anyone for Turkey day. I will go there again to try there other food and hopefully it will be a lot better.\n\nAnswer:",

First off, they play the same ol pop music on rotation. Hip hop and r&b? What a joke of selection they play. I like rap and r&b but I  would like this station even more if they showed a bit more creativity  for example, it wouldn't hurt to hire some skilled djs that mixed live on the air. I don't mean by playing a mix of random songs but by truly mixing and scratching. Theyre current dj's suck in my opinion. 975 would gain so many listeners if this was done.

We were staying at the luxor, and we decided to stay \\\"in\\\" for the night, but didn't want to go out on the strip for a good dinner.  After reading the other reviews on yelp, I decided this place was worth trying.  \\n\\nWe had to wait maybe 15 mins for a table, but had a really good drink at the bar, so it wasn't a bad wait. After finally being seated, we decided the wait was worth it.  They seated us to a very nice, intimate booth.  Right away we could tell this place was great.  \\n\\nWe started out with an iceberg lettuce salad, I had the 2.25 lb lobster, and my husband had the angus ribeye.  My husband requested his steak medium rare plus, and most places don't ever get this right.  His steak was cooked to perfection.  My lobster was brought to me in a covered dish, with a lobster bisque type sauce, which was delicious, even though I usually prefer my lobster plain.  For dessert, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake, which the waiters presented me the cake with a candle and chocolate \\\"happy birthday\\\" design.  \\n\\nTender is definitely worth checking if you want a fabulous steak or surf and turf dinner!\n\nAnswer:",

I researched a tad about the restaurant, but I hadn't ever talked to anyone who had been here.  The reviews I read shared how small the servings were and how pricey the menu was.  I will agree that the menu is pricey, but not outrageous.  I was also expecting more of a selection, but the menu is only about 20 items. As well, I like draft beer, but there were only four options as well -- a little of a disappointment.  Anyways, I ordered a chicken panini sandwich with fries, and the portion I was served was a decent amount (more than I was expecting after reading the reviews).  Our waiter was very courteous and patient with us trying to talk to one another and yet figure out what we wanted.  All in all, this restaurant is located inside of a hotel, and it would be a place I might go back to without actually staying at the hotel.  So....not bad.\n\nAnswer:",

I tried one of the shakes (technically some kind of grenada-something not a shake) and a hot chocolate, as I was between meals. The 'shake' was definitely a different style with the character of a raw chocolate powder based icee with rich dark chocolate with a lot of character to it, however it was just quite my thing, not creamy, not melt in your mouth irresistable, just very cold and strong. The hot chocolate was interesting (I would recommend it above the shake) with a very very frothy head to it. Again it was very rich, but I think that combines better with a hot beverage than a cold one, not my favorite but different and interesting. Probably I should not have tried both because they are strong raw chocolate with a lot more power than the usual stuff and I ended up with a headache later, but I did not want to miss the experience. Overall the italian ice at another very well reviewed vegas desert stop was more to my liking, but to each their own. For $5-7 to try a chocolate item though this place will cost you a lot less than most things in vegas though, so it is worth a try to see if it is your thing.\n\nAnswer:",

My office orders from here often, and every single time there's an issue. It takes twice the time we were quoted, there's something missing from or wrong with our order, the delivery driver doesn't bring any change - there's always something. \\n\\nWhile the employees seem a little on the \\\"slow\\\" side, they're at least usually pleasant - with the exception of a woman I spoke to who said she was the owner.

Because the food is just that. damn. good. Seriously. Their sandwiches are piled high with inventive, high-quality ingredients and always taste fresh and well-made. And don't even get me started on their cookies! They are spec-freaking-tacular - huge, gooey, moist, and often still warm from the oven. \\n\\nSo, the service? Thoroughly \\\"meh\\\".

Unfortunately delivery went from an average of 45 minutes to over an hour. One night delivery was nearly two hours long. Despite this I still continued to order, until one incident where they charged me for rice that was supposed to come with the meal. The top menu clearly stated that the chicken korma came with basmati rice, however when the driver came to my door (I had prepaid with my credit card over the phone) I noticed I was charged over $3 for the rice. I called and told them it was supposed to be included and I wanted them to refund my card. The man on the phone was extremely rude and told me I didn't read the menu correctly. 5 minutes later he finally pulled up top menu, and noticed that it did in fact say it came with rice. He said that the next time I ordered he's give me a free samosa. I said that I order there frequently, and the last time it took 2 hours for my food to arrive he promised a free samosa that never came. I was adamant at getting my $3 refunded and did not drop the issue. They did in fact refund the card after over 10 minutes of arguing with the rude man on the phone. They have burned this bridge.

I bought a dozen assortment and initially I was impressed at how pretty they were.  However, 7 out of the 12 were dry and we ended up throwing them away!  I did buy them and bring them immediately to a party, so it wasn't like I kept them overnight somewhere.  I e-mailed the website the following day, but I didn't hear from them at all.  I called them a couple of weeks later and they said that they didn't get my e-mail.  I asked to speak to the manager but they gave me the run-around and told me to e-mail Pamela, the manager, directly.  I did but again did not hear from them.  So I called again and spoke to someone else other than the manager and they said that I should have brought the dry cupcakes as proof.  Can you believe that?  That thought never even occured to me.  She even asked me questions like \\\"how long did I leave it out?\\\", etc.  $30 for a dozen cupcakes is not cheap and I expect certain level of quality.  SO IF YOU GET CUPCAKES FROM HERE AND ARE NOT SATISFIED, DON'T THROW IT AWAY LIKE I DID.  KEEP IT AND BRING IT TO THE STORE FOR PROOF! If you do try one flavor, try the red velvet one.

I was very excited to take friends out and have a good night. The stipulations of the gift card were that you have to order $100 worth of food, and I figured that 5 adults and 2 kids could do that. Our bill was $116, but most of it was drinks, so we weren't allowed to use the gift certificate. No big deal, the gc made us pay an 18% gratuity, and I was pissed at the thought of being made to pay that for the service we received. (Silver lining, I found it!)\\n\\nWe got there around 6 and stood around for like 10 minutes waiting to be seated. We were handed menus and were almost ignored the entire 2 hours we were there (it should have only taken 1 1/2 hours.) I ordered a tea, which I sweetened with stevia from home. I asked for a spoon to stir my tea and never received one (even though I asked 2 times.) We had 4 orders of \\\"trimichangas\\\" (3 mini chimichangas, 1 carne asada, 1 chicken, and 1 al pastor served with rice and beans), a bacon cheeseburger with fries, chicken tenders with fries, and a grilled cheese sandwich with rice. We also ordered an appetizer platter.\\n\\nThe plates the waitress brought out for the appetizers were DIRTY! They all had buffalo chicken residue on them. They took them back and they brought out coffee cup saucers instead.\\n\\nThe appetizer platter tasted like stuff I could get in the freezer section of nearly any grocery store, but it wasn't awful.\\n\\nMy kids' food (grilled cheese and chicken tenders) came out before ours did, they did fries with the grilled cheese, and when the error was pointed out, the person that brought the food out (NOT the waitress) took the entire plate back and came back with a grilled cheese and rice.)\\n\\nThe chimichangas were really greasy, the beef one was mostly fat, the rice and beans were cold on all 4 plates.\\n\\nThe red salsa was Pace, which in Arizona does not fly, at all.\\n\\nThe bacon cheeseburger was overdone, my friend called it a \\\"twice grilled\\\" burger. I don't know if she didn't like the fries, she didn't eat them.\\n\\nWe had to call out to the waitress for drink refills, and my refill of iced tea came back with something floating in it.\\n\\nWe were the ONLY table there on a Friday night for half of the meal, there was no excuse for the slow service.\\n\\nWe ordered dessert in an attempt to up the bill (not knowing how far from the total we were) and we were told that half of the desserts listed weren't available (oh, excuse me \\\"desert\\\" is what it said on the menu!) My kids each got an ice cream sundae because they were very well behaved, and I ordered a slice of chocolate cake to share with my husband. The waitress said she'd put a lot of chocolate syrup on my youngest's sundae (she wanted chocolate ice cream, but they didn't have any, so I told her if she stirred in the chocolate syrup it would be like chocolate ice cream and she was really excited about that idea) but when it came out there wasn't much on it. The chocolate cake didn't look anything like chocolate cake, because it wasn't. It was tiramisu. Not a bad thing, but not what you're wanting when you order chocolate cake! To make matters worse, it was still semi frozen!\\n\\nWe're not going back ever again and I'm not sure who to bestow the gift certificate on.  Who do I hate the most?

The ceilings just take your breathe away.  It always feels like daytime with all the clouds.  The ambiance of Paris is...what can say...European.  It is Paris after all.  \\n\\nAnyway, the hotel is an older hotel compared to some others on the strip.  The rooms are nice and clean.  Nothing super fancy but definitely a step up from places like California, Main Street, IP and Harrah's.  It is smaller than most casino's though, but that doesn't bother me at all.\\n\\nThe best thing I like about this hotel is if you get a room with a view...it's Gorgeous!!!  Our last room, we could see the Bellagio fountains.  It was Awesome!  You also get a good view of the Eiffel Tower, which is beautiful at night.  You can also see the nice big pool.  The crowd there is an older crowd so you don't have all the young, drunk 21 year olds going crazy all over the place.\\n\\nThe parking structure is shared with Bally's and the walk is pretty far compared to others.  The shops there are kind of pricey but its fun to just walk around and window shop.\\n\\nThe dealers there are pretty friendly, but we noticed that it takes a while for a cocktail waitress to come around.\\n\\nOut of all the Total Rewards casino's, for some reason I feel the safest at Paris.

About a year ago, we waited at the hostess stand for so long that we decided to leave.  When we got to our car and put it in reverse, all of a sudden, a waitress comes knocking on my window!

I guess times really ARE hard when a waitress comes outside and figuratively begs for her lost tip.\\n\\nAnyway, I was dismayed when that same waitress ended up at our table last night.  It was obvious why we waited so long to be seated during the previous visit.... she was slooooooow and seemed completely oblivious to my agitation.  There were only two tables in the whole restaurant, so a glass of water shouldn't take 15 minutes to deliver.  Ugh.  \\n\\nThe three stars are for the STEAK TIPS.  Oh my, they are good.  Whether you get them as a breakfast platter or a dinner platter is irrelevant.  The sides don't matter at all either way.

I don't say that lightly either - I'm a carnivorous sort of lady.\\n\\nSo come here if you've got all night to waste, because it's probably gonna take that long to get your order.

I had the tortilla soup it was not good I have had 100x better from Red Robin, it didnt have any tortilla in it I asked what the deal was.

But I tasted the sandwich and knew immediately it was chunk light (sometimes called \\\"chunk white\\\"). Anyone who eats/buys canned tuna knows there are 2 grades, solid white being higher quality and more expensive and chunk light/white being lower quality (more miscellaneous fish parts) and cheaper. I brought the sandwich up to the guy and told him I was sure it was chunk light/white, and he said it was and asked if I wanted something instead. \\n\\nSo the dude straight lied to me and thought I wouldn't be able to taste the difference??? I really don't care if City Centre Cafe wants to save a few bucks by using lower-grade tuna, but don't lie about it to your customers!!!!

They are known for their meatballs so a few of us ordered those. Let me tell you, the meatballs in the frozen section at the supermarket were better. Very bland. The lasagna? Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30.

How do you make it so bland? \\n\\nAnyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't.

The weather definitely helped improve my opinion of the place, as it is an outdoor restaurant.\\nWe had a slight wait on the Sunday morning that we went, which we didn't mind at all because of the lovely scenery at The Farm @ South Mountain. It definitely makes you forget that you are in the middle of the desert.\\nWe were seated at a 4-top, even though we were only a party of 2. It was nice to have the extra room! I got the American Breakfast, which included 2 scrambled eggs, home fries, applewood smoked bacon and a DELICIOUS biscuit that we had to order 2 more of, they were that good! \\nMy husband had the local Schreiner's sausage, tomato and cheese omelette, which he really enjoyed, but I think he could have easily eaten a slightly larger portion.\\nThe food was really great! We had a really sweet server as well.\\nThe only complaint I have is that they had what looked like an all-you-can-drink beverage bar, where they were serving lemonade, tea and water from big canteens in plastic cups. Of course, we grabbed 2 drinks thinking \\\"Oh, how nice!\\\" Unfortunately, both drinks turned up on our tab. I would have appreciated someone warning us that they charge for the drink bar.\\nBut, that's OK. Now I am more informed and I would definitely come back here!\n\nAnswer:",

If this club was not soo crowded it would have gotten 4 stars for sure. \\n\\n\\nat around midnight they had a \\\"golddigger\\\" contest for women... pretty much they would drop fake dollar bills from the top balcony onto the dance floor, and you had to scoop up as many bills as you could within 30 mins... at the end they would weight your stack of bills and the winner would get $5,000 CASH... pretty sweet right? ya if it werent from 110 pound girls literally running over me lol. but i cant hate... it was like a mosh pit!\n\nAnswer:",

The water server was much more pleasant and happy than our table server.  I did not understand the ambiance of the place:  elegant food, modern decor, but the music was nonsensical noise; way too loud and I don't even know what kind of music it was.  Just didn't make sense to me at all.  I was served a glass of wine from a bad bottle and feel the server should have known it, or the bartender, as it was a Pinot Grigio and the color was orange!  My chair was also broken and it is a good thing I noticed it BEFORE I sat on it.  Other than that, it was great fun to eat and experience Chef Ramsay's food, finally!!!!  My husband had the steak, and it was cooked correctly, but the flavor was just average.  It needed a little pizzazz. Though, the lobster mac and cheese is unlike anything you've had before.  Just super creamy and cheesey!   I had the fish and chips, and it was delicious - the batter was very light and crispy.  The wine selection is limited, but you should find what you like on it.  The appetizer shrimp cocktail is amazing and fun to look at!  I've seen the steak presentation at other restaurants, so I knew what to expect, but I don't think our server was particularly helpful in that area......he seemed too distracted and rushed.  It is worth a try for a special occasion and if you have some cash to spend.\n\nAnswer:",

And I patiently wait for those trips back to get my haircut in Koreatown.   \\n\\nThis summer, however, I didn't have a chance to go back and after trying to hold out for as long as possible, I simply needed to get a haircut. LA or not.  So after trying to find someone on Yelp that would be competent in cutting Asian hair (my hair is really thick and really stiff), I decided on Jim Jeon based on the decent reviews.\\n\\nYelp, you have been my trusty guide to so many places for years now. Yet of all the times you could have fooled me, you decide to do it when I get my haircut? Yelp, you so sneaky.\\n\\nI've heard of dramatic or critical reviews mysteriously disappearing on Yelp, so I will try to be as objective, calm and understated as possible: The haircut was horrible.\\n\\nLike I said, I am cursed with very thick Asian hair.  If you cut it wrong, my hair will stick out in all directions like I was holding onto a static balloon.  No matter how much gel or wax you use.  So now I look like I have a black, spiky mushroomcap on top of my head. It's like I'm back in the 80's.  Lesson learned: doesn't matter how long before an LA trip. One always waits. \\n\\nFriends, I'm sorry, but this place is not good.

Justin & Jackie came out for a free estimate & I was super impressed by their professionalism and knowledge of the business. They gave me a quote with a detailed explanation of everything that was going to be done and it was very honest and fair. I hired them on the spot. Justin did an AMAZING job. I expected good results but it far surpassed my expectations!! It is obvious that he takes pride in his work because everything was spotless! Thank you thank you thank you!!

I give Kona 3 stars because of the seating restrictions and service during Happy Hour, which is usually when I end up here.\\n\\nThe Happy Hour menu has a limited but decent selection of food and drinks.  While Kona has a nice patio setup, you have to fight for tables out there or in the bar area since the HH specials do not carry over into the dining room area (which is totally empty during HH).  Don't be surprised when your bill comes out at the end of your meal to find a group of hunger people hovering next to your table waiting to grab your seat as soon as you stand up.  Also, the service during HH is hit or miss.  You either get a really great and attentive server, or you end up with several people randomly checking in on you once they realize that all the drinks at your table have been empty for 10 minutes.\n\nAnswer:",

I arrived to their main cross roads and had a difficult time finding their suite. I had pulled over and called the business a few times. No one answered the phone, so I began driving around the complex one more time and by my lucky stars, found the place. However, I was late. I walked inside and no one greeted me. I didn't see or hear anyone. I shouted \\\"hello\\\" twice. I was about to walk out the door, since I had been standing at the counter for a couple of minutes when finally an employee stepped out. I was told that I was late and could not keep my appointment, because there was no receptionist to answer my phone calls for help. All in all, I was penalized for them not having a receptionist and for the employees who were there who could not pick up the phone. On top of the lack of common sense to help out the business and answer the phone, the employee argued with me about giving me another appointment. I was told to give them my name and number and they would call me sometime. I asked when they would call me and was informed that they had no idea, but hopefully today. Terrible customer service.

Seems that Christoper doesn't just dish out bacon he drizzles it with honey, then he tops it with finely chopped cilantro and finally mixes in bits of hot red peppers......for an OMG taste.

We parked right in front of where they load the wood into their smokers.  It was a good sight to see.  Looked like we were in for some great BBQ.  We got in line and I was in awe of the big smokers they have behind the counter.  When you order your stuff, they pull it out of the smoker and cut it fresh for you and weigh it right in front of you on a scale.  They then place it on butcher paper and into a milk carton type tray.  I couldn't wait to try it!  We were in for some grub!  There was no line either (probably due to Easter) at almost noon which was a score!\\n\\n\\nOne of my coworkers used to work at a Rudys in Texas many years ago and he recommended I get a few things....  Pork ribs, creamed corn and a loaded baked potato with meat.  We got that and a whole bunch more too ;-).  We got 1/4 pound lean brisket, 1/4 pound smoked turkey, 3 pork ribs, 3 baby back ribs, a half chicken, a loaded baked potato with brisket on top, some creamed corn and some drinks. They also give you slices of white/wheat bread for free so you can make sandwiches out of your meat.  Total came out to $35.00.\\n\\nHere is how the food stacked up..................\\n\\nPork Ribs- These things were fantastic.  They had a fantastic bark on them.  Almost looked burnt but they weren't.  They tasted great and had a strong pepper/smoke flavor to them.  I liked them a lot and my friend wasn't lying when he recommended them.  They were awesome!\\n\\nBaby Back Ribs-  These were great too.  Not as blackened as the pork ribs but still seasoned well.  The meat came off the bone with just a little tug.  Damn they were good!\\n\\nSmoked Turkey-  Delicious!  It had the perfect amount of smoke flavor but was still pretty moist and not dried out.  My best friend is a turkey lover (he ordered turkey every chance he could on our KC/Memphis trip a few years back).  He would have loved this stuff.  It was great!\\n\\nLean Brisket-  I'm usually not a big brisket fan but this stuff was legit.  You could see the straight up smoke ring around the edge of the meat.  It was tender and delicious.  I don't know if I have ever had better brisket.  I would definitely get it again.\\n\\nLoaded Baked Potato-  They give you a softball sized baked potato and top it with a ton of butter, cheese, sour cream (we skipped the sour cream) and your choice of meat.  We got brisket on it and unlike the slices of brisket they give you when you order brisket on its own, this stuff was almost like burnt ends chunked brisket.  Tasted great!\\n\\nHalf Chicken-  This is the only thing we didn't really like.  We picked at it a bit and it had a great smoked flavor but we were so full from everything else that we tossed most of it.  Wouldn't get it again.\\n\\nCreamed Corn-  This was just ok.  I like corn but usually when its corn on the cob.  Plain corn I will eat but I'm not the biggest fan.  This corn tasted like frozen corn you can buy and then they creamed it up.  Its almost like a gravy of sorts.  I probably would not get it again.  We tossed most of it.\\n\\nCoke products in the fountain drinks.  They had a grip of bottled drinks/beer in huge metal tubs of ice too.  It was cool to see.  My wife got a root beer in a bottle and liked it.\\n\\nService was friendly.  They did forget to give me my potato at first but then when we brought it to their attention they got on top of it right away and brought it out to our table.  Total of $35.00 for the giant crate of food we got was well worth it IMO.  \\n\\nThis was some of the best BBQ I have had in a long long time.  It reminded me of me and my buddies trip to KC and Memphis a few years back.  The smoked meats are delicious and I would come back often if I lived out here.  Don't even ask me how their BBQ sauce tasted.......I didn't try it.  The meat was so damn good it didn't need any.  That's a winner folks!  Legit Texas BBQ at its finest!\n\nAnswer:",

Since I've been craving dim sum for a few months now, this place got lucky that I devoured everything in front of me. The bad news, I got food poisoning. I knew there was something wrong with the pork shumai when it reeked of bad pork and the cavier on top was still gooey on top, but I was beyond hungry and going through one of my cravings so I forged ahead. There is a limited dim sum menu for night time. Here is the breakdown: Edible and decent: sweet custard buns and shrimp balls. Reminiscent of dim sum: banana leaf sticky rice, shrimp potstickers and pork buns. Either bland or bad: pork shumai and shark fin potstickers. I heard there are much better places to go for dim sum in Vegas...so don't go here for it, unless it's really late and you are beyond crave monster status.

Most of the girls that work there are hot and young... that doesn't make them the best waitresses, but they are usually nice. \\n\\nThe atmosphere isn't anything terribly special - it's basically just the place to go to be seen and people watch. It's full of the same douchebags and plastics that went out the night before - they still look like their hair gel and guyliner is holding up and their designer shirt maybe has one or two extra wrinkles. The ladies seldom look like they left the house unshowered or without makeup. Mostly pretty people anyway... I always feel like a disgusting mess when I'm there because I just roll out of bed and go dirty.\\n\\nThe food is fairly delicious, but I think it's pretty difficult to fuck up breakfast. It's not excessively greasy though which is nice... There are many breakfast favorites that serve greasy meals. Their standard eggs, bacon, fruit, bread, and hashbrowns is very light as well as filling. Their omlettes are slightly above average. \\n\\nIt can also be rather inexpensive here which is nice for the $30,000/year millionaires. It can also be fairly pricey depending on what you get... it's the drinks - that's where they get you. They are priced like mixed drinks, but it's just orange juice or coffee. \\n\\nThe problems with this place are that it's tough to find a seat, you have to keep your appetite while eating around douchers, and there are half a dozen other breakfast places within a few miles of it that are as good if not better. I do like this place though and I'll continue to go... food is 4 stars, ambience is 3, service is 3.5... this place really gets a 3 and a half. Go check it out.\n\nAnswer:",

Lately I've noticed that even though they may have fresh burgers, a 'cool' 'secret' menu (that everyone knows about) they have quite a few problems that have been adding up to my annoyance over the years.\\nI've lived right up the street from this place for 18 years, so I was there when it first opened up (and it was a big deal to the community, no more shall we have to drive down to Lake Mead!) and have seen them develop over the years.\\n1.) Service has gotten worse, the wait time is ridiculous, and to make it more of an insult they have an actual timer for you to watch while you wait. This applies to when it is busy (which I can understand to a POINT- fifteen minutes at the LAST window? Not cool) and when you  come at 11pm at night and wait 10 minutes for your fries and milkshake. I'm sorry, but it has gotten ridiculous over the years, the amount of waiting I have to do inside and outside (inside is worse by the way) so much so that when I went to one in San Francisco (one that had TWO lines by the way) I expected to wait half an hour, but it turned out it took less time to get us through there than it does here at this location when there is only one person in front of you. So it is not an overall In N Out issue, it is THIS place's issue.\\n2.) Prices have gone way up. End of story.\\n3.) It is not unresonable to ask for a grilled cheese to be grilled away from the burgers, on the other grill. Escpecially not when there is an actual option for it. So when I ask, and I find meat chunks on my grilled cheese, I know you did not, in fact, grill it on the other grill. This ties into a very important reason why I no longer come to this location: They rarely listen to what you want, if it is outside of the \\\"Double Double no onions\\\" deal. More cheese? Maybe. No salt on your fries? Perhaps. Half strawberry half chocolate milkshake? Kinda. If they can't hold up to their 'secret' menu, then they should not have it as an option.\\nOther locations are way better.\n\nAnswer:",

I had a bad first experience.. came back a 2nd time to give it a 2nd chance, but still its a disappointment. Never will i come back to this Hakkashit nightclub.\\n----------------- EDIT ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n10/3. I slightly changed the ratings from 1 star to 3,  maybe 3.5, but 4 indicates that I'm a fan but I'm really not. This past weekend, I gave Hakkasan another go. To be honest, I had a lot more fun this time around versus the first two times I've been here. I love the hiphop floor more than the edm floor, so their hip hop floor is pretty nice. Our host for our table was extremely nice and funny, I think his name was Max but I might have forgot his name, but he was pretty cute. The hostess at our table was really helpful and sweet! So not all the staffs at Hakkasan are unfriendly!  This visit would've been a 5 ratings or even a 4 but around 2am, the bouncer kicked us out of our table because we didn't have any alcohol beverages anymore on the table, I didn't know or wasn't notified that you have to have drinks at the table at all times in order to stay there. Bummer.... Regardless of getting kicked out, things was going fine, until two of my friends lost their wallet because someone pickpocketed him. this had happen almost consistently; once this trip and another back in August.  My friend who lost her phone did not drop it because it was in her purse that was zipped up. I don't really blame Hakkasan for the thefts, since it could happen at any nightclub, but people should just be extra careful when they go to Hakkasan. Go hard for another nightclub! :)\n\nAnswer:",

I always order the waffle and it normally comes out cold and is served with cold syrup but Mary's cheerful personality kept me coming back anyways. This last time, Sunday, November 16, 2014, we sat at the counter and seemed like an inconvenience to our waitress the entire breakfast. There is nothing worse than feeling like you are not worthy of someone's time. I understand that turning over tables is important but it's also important to ensure your guests are satisfied. Couldn't get our waters refilled quickly, food came out cold, waitress was impersonal and the cashier was awfully rude as well. I'd recommend sunrise cafe or protein house instead.\n\nAnswer:",

I wish I could say I like it...but having tried Cardenas at US 95 & Decatur first, then checking out Mariana's I set myself up for disappointment. First off parking is tight. Getting in the door you have a Rent a Center \\\"outlet\\\" to your left, slot machines to the right, then you have to make a hard Left and loop around the checkouts to get to the rest of the store. And if the checkout lines are long it's a pain to get through. And once you get into the rest of the store, it's dark, the aisles are narrow, and it's just claustrophobic! \\n\\nProduce wise, I was not impressed with quality, selection, and especially pricing. In fact price was an issue all over the store. If one comparison shops you will realize Mariana's is high. The carniceria is shoved along the North wall with a mediocre selection and again, you can do better on price, selection, and even quality. . \\n\\nI could go on and on but I walked out with hand made chips, salsa, and guac among other things. I put Cardenas offerings on the table, side by side with Mariana's. The Mariana's chips were thicker but held their own, but Mariana's salsa had a slight vinegary like twang to it...where Cardenas didn't. But then the guac ended it...3 dips into Mariana's guac and I got water. Not so with the guac from Cardenas. \\n\\nCouple that with mixing \\\"Mexican\\\" cane sugar Coke in with High Fructose sweetened Coke on the same shelf along with checkout staff that doesn't know how to smile and I will drive 2x the distance and go back to Cardenas. At least Mariana's does offer rides home to those who need it...but for me, I just don't see any reason to go back. At least not to Mariana's #3.\n\nAnswer:",

We had friends show up early to reserve a table for 8, we met up with them and sat down, ordered drinks, and everything seemed to be going smoothly. But then throughout the night, rude remarks and attitude was given by the server (not going to mention names because you know who you are) . You could tell she just clearly did not want to be there. The main issue occurred when the checks were brought to the table. Everything was unorganized. With ALL of us  at the table working in the restaurant industry (including our manager), we DO understand rough days and the business. But I have NEVER felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant. She then proceeded to drop the checks off... one check book had a salad on it, I recognized it was not ours and put it in the middle of the table.  We situated our money and she then came by to picked up our tabs. But before she could even do that...she snapped at our table saying we had some other tables check book, I said \\\"yes, we put it in the middle of our table because it wasn't ours\\\", she then says \\\"well where's the money that was in it\\\" we say there was none that we had seen. She then pulls aside the table that the check belonged to as they are exiting and questions if they paid their tab... they say \\\"yes, with cash\\\". She comes back to us (mind you making scene in front of the patio) saying it is \\\"impossible\\\" that there was no money in it, assuming we stole it. Coming from a table full of servers we discussed that we would never accuse a table and track back steps before throwing accusations around...well what do you know, the money was on the floor. How did the manager handle it? He simply stated he would talk to her. I have never felt so offended and appalled by how we were treated. It is called customer service. Not only did she do that, but as other guests would leave she would lean out the patio while they were walking to their cars asking if they paid their tabs. Just very unprofessional. She then brings back our checks but one booklet has three tabs in it and she says the cash amount given was insufficient because she forgot a tab... at this point I thought it was a joke. We all gave her enough money, but at this point I felt she wouldn't get a tip because clearly she did not deserve one and pocketed the money, with our manager fed up, he took care whatever needed to be paid for because he just wanted to get out of there. I have never tipped lower than 20% even if the service was bad, knowing that everyone has their days. But being accused of stealing while trying to enjoy a nice evening is uncalled for. Her demeanor was awful and the whole transaction had me sick. I will not be attending this Zipps in the near future.\n\nAnswer:",

I know a lot of places in Old Town have bouncers out early, but this place is just different.\\n\\n-Big dude walking around the front of house, helping guests.. which wouldn't matter, but he had a chef's coat on that actually had the word \\\"chef\\\" embroidered on the front.. shouldnt you be in back of house orchestrating the kitchen? Whose making the food?\\n\\n-Bartender 1 knocked my water all over me. Got my shirt and my pants. He offered me a free drink,  which was nice, but for some reason that just didn't feel like consolation enough. Bartender 2 watched the whole thing and just shook her head. \\n\\n-The tub of sanitizing water bartenders use to wash glassware was situated right behind the bar, in front of where we were seated. As bartender 2 washed glasses, drops of the sanitizer water hit my face. It probably got the food too. This happened TWICE. Definitely not cool.\\n\\n-The food is just mediocre.\\n\\n-When a place has the word \\\"tacos\\\" in the name, I expect a decently wide variety of tacos on the menu. Not the case.\\n\\nI would eat here again if I was with a group of people who all wanted to go, but I wouldn't come here on my own accord, thats for sure.\n\nAnswer:",

The appearance and feel of the place is that of a diner/Irish-dive-bar hybrid.  It isn't dirty but it is a bit dark.  It isn't all-american diner, but there's a diner-esque  feel to the floor-plan.

About 30 minutes later tho ... we were all laughing together and having a grande ole time!!  So I'll file that into \\\"crappy first impression\\\" archive and give her the benefit of the doubt. (I used to work retail, so I know sometimes customers is that last thing we want to see.)\\n\\nNow on to the booze and drinks!  Our drinks were STRONG.  Linda W. asked for a Dark&Stormy which caused the initial inconvenience wave since ginger beer was in the kitchen coolers.  I went with a basic Diet & Vanilla vodka.  Drinks were strong and good.  The D&S could have used some extra lime but it was heavy enough that it was good in its own right.\\n\\nThe food was good.  My burger was cooked to order and the sweet potato fries were scrumptious.  Linda W. was able to get a basket of fries which were a great value!\\n\\nThere are a couple drink-and-chill all the time type customers there so the conversation was rather interesting once Serena R. arrived dressed as Carmen SanDiego.

The Spanakopita was barely warm, and I had to double check that they actually used fillo dough. It certainly didn't look like it at first glance, and it did not have much of a flaky crunch. It absolutely was not worth nearly $4 for a very modest halved triangle. My sirloin with hummus was simply not appetizing- the two flavors did not  marry well to my taste, and the meat was too overdone (and I was not given an option to have it rarer). The chicken with hummus and pine nuts is far superior and a dish I have enjoyed many times before. Hubby enjoyed his falafel pita well enough. His only complaint was that there was not enough tzatsiki sauce. I thought the falafel was overly crunchy and too dry on the inside, but then again, I am super picky about falafel, having spent a summer in Ann Arbor years ago, learning Arabic and eating outstanding Middle Eastern food. \\n\\nThe service was OK, not particularly friendly, but efficient.

The food selection on the HH menu was also decent and what we had was very good.\\n\\nService was attentive even though the bar is rather small it was packed and the two bartenders were running around constantly.  They were also friendly and knowledgeable which is always a plus.\\n\\nNow onto the bad.  My wife and I split the Maui Rib-eye, I think the price was $30.00.  Now don't get me wrong I have NO problem paying $30.00 for a steak with no side,  it is the norm in most fine dining steakhouses, however when this one arrived it was not a $30.00 steak.\\n\\nThe rib-eye was thin, way to much grizzle around the outside, cmon guys trim it a bit?  And to be honest I have purchased better cuts of steaks at Costco and Fry's. After my wife's first bite she said you can cook them better too.  The point of going to a fine dining steakhouse is to get a steak I don't want to pay $30 for at Whole Foods or AJ's.  \\n\\nWe will no doubt go back for Happy Hour, but not so sure about having steak at a place called Chop is kind of disappointing.\n\nAnswer:",

Two quick notes:\\n\\n1) After waiting for 20 minutes and being at the head of the line, the hostess or seater tried telling us that they were all out of inside seating. I told them we would wait and then counted three empty booths inside. Don't try to make a customer who has waited their turn sit in the heat (yes, even with misters), if there are open tables. That's dishonest and unfair. \\n\\n2) After resolving the whole table debacle there was still another wait because one of the cashiers left and was chatting and laughing with other staff members for a good five minutes (with the line practically out the door). \\n\\nShow you deserve and know how to handle your popularity. Don't seat outside unless you have to when it's over 95 degrees. And communicate with your staff that the dinner rush is not the time for breaks. Just suggestions, other than that, keep up the good work.\n\nAnswer:",

Walking in, I felt like it was very similar to the type of thing you would see in the States, (i.e. Paradise Bakery or Panera), it isn't super clear how to order, and it takes a minute to figure out how it works, but in all, it is very similar to other places about town offering soup and sandwiches. The pastries looked amazing and it is a lovely space, all be it, a bit too massive. The windows are great, but it feels a bit like a cafeteria maybe. The staff was very friendly and our food came out promptly. I am surprised they don't give you table numbers, seeing it is such a large caf\\u00e9, but they had no trouble finding it. \\n\\nThe food was very good, however, a bit pricy, they were very large portions for lunch size. For \\u00a38.95, you can do a half sandwich and soup or a quiche and soup. We opted for one of each, I got the brie and aubergine quiche and the roasted pepper and cabbage soup and my boyfriend had the salmon sandwich and a chicken and lentil soup. The quiche was delicious, lots of brie and a great sized slice. The soup was equally as lovely, my only gripe is that parsley is not a great garnish, but that's just me. The half sandwich was definitely a whole sandwich in my opinion and the bread was amazingly soft and grain-filled. We really enjoyed splashing out for lunch, but my recommendation would be to lower the price and the portion sizes. \\n\\nIt's not somewhere I would go regularly for lunch as without drinks our meals were \\u00a318 together. I have found the same sort of meal to be about \\u00a312-13 pounds elsewhere. Although, great quality so I can't complain other then be a sort of budget eater. It also has a mixed lunch crowd, including business to babies. So be warned.\\n\\nIf you go downstairs to use the loo you can see into the bakery, and it just smells wonderfully of butter. I would say, a lovely place to grab a bit, but it doesn't feel very local, if that makes sense. Maybe the size of it, makes me feel it isn't a very warm place to have lunch regularly. Although the \\u00a31 filter coffee, reminded me of America and good on them for offering it. \\n\\nDefinitely a very business area-type eatery, with delicious food, although slightly out of my price range to be a regular. Although, the sweet and treats looked heavenly. Maybe I will return for a delicious treat some day.\n\nAnswer:",

I normally would have given the buffet 4-stars (easily), but my last two visits (one today and once this past April) have changed my mind and rating. The service has slowly degraded to the point that the staff seems rushed/impatient, while the tables aren't very clean. As far as food goes the variety is still there, but it tends to be drier, flavorless, and lifeless. When I return again in a few weeks I'll be looking for another place to eat.\n\nAnswer:",

My only problem was that there is not seating and the wait staff move at an extreme glacial pace. There is one side for coffee and crepes and there is another side just for desserts. It's never marked which side is which so I had no idea where to go. The worst part is I wanted both a dessert and a crepe and both the lines were long and slow! What on earth was I supposed to do? When I finally got to the front of the line I asked the man if there was any way that I could put in an order for a crepe even though I was on the dessert side and instead of saying \\\"let me see what I can do\\\" he huffed and puffed and told me what a trouble it was going to be for him and I should just wait in both lines next time.

It took them two days to tell us.  The doctor had written all that info down, but they \\\"Lost it\\\". Not a comfortable feeling when a relative's life is in danger.  They took some unneeded tests that were already taken elsewhere. (Additional procedures means more money). The waiting rooms weren't very clean or comfortable.

In fact, he said, \\\"I'm from California, and the medical system in LV is one of the most challenging I've seen.\\\"  Great, thanks for the info.\\n\\nAs a result, the actual hospital stay was two to three days longer that it should have been.

Everyone's happy and none the wiser.\\n\\nIt's the only store of its kind I've seen in Edinburgh, and I'm not surprised it's located in Bruntsfield! A La Carte prepares meals, which the customer buys frozen and the menu is really quite extensive. They do soups, poultry, pork, meat and vegetarian dishes as well as desserts, and whilst there are some fancy meals such as fruity moroccan lamb and leek filo tarts, a lot of the dishes are surprisingly simple and homey. Macaroni and cheese, shepherd's pie and meatballs and spaghetti are on the menu and capture the spirit of what most of the other dishes are like. I would personally make a lot of these meals myself rather than pay for them, but I guess some people go for this sort of thing.\\nWhat excites me more about A La Carte are their baked goods, which are fresh each day! They do scones, cakes, bread etc, which I'm more than happy to buy.\n\nAnswer:",

The family was starving and I was in the mood to try something new.  I ordered some chicken and beef tacos, chicken and beef tostadas, a cheese quesadilla, some chips/salsa, and flan to go.  It didn't take too long for the order.  It was probably in the 5-10 minute range.  \\n\\nI took it all home and placed it on the table for everyone to dig in.  We pulled out the tacos and tostadas.  The meat was great!  Everyone agreed that the tacos were better than the tostadas.  The tostadas seemed to be a little on the crispy side.  The kids tore through the quesadilla so I'm assuming it was pretty good.  The chips and salsa were very good.  \\n\\nThey also give you a salsa bar to select different kinds of salsa which is very nice.  We sampled the different salsas and found them all to be very tasty.  \\n\\nWe all finished and it was time for dessert...the flan.  Wait, all the bags were open...where was the flan???  Well $&%@!!!!  They didn't give us the flan but they were nice enough to charge us for it.  I have to admit it was one of the pictures I saw here on yelp and it looked so good.  I was really looking forward to trying it.  I thought about going back and the kids wanted me to go back but it was late on a Monday night and I just wasn't feeling like going to argue for flan.  \\n\\nI've been debating between giving this place a 3 or a 4.  I really liked the meat but I'm really pissed about the flan.  I finally decided to go ahead and give it a 4.  I did like the flavor of the meat and I will probably return for more tacos.

There's a general pass-the-buck mentality in the store, and it's obvious there's a total lack of communication between departments. Stuff that I've put on will call (stocked items, like bulk tile, baseboards, and other like-items) on my LAR have never been available when asked for. They consistently mess up orders, and are consistently slow and inept at getting things right the first time.

There's a nice balcony/pool area, that is all the more enjoyable if you go during a warm evening.\\n\\nEverything else about this club is a nightmare.  If you are absolutely insistent on checking this place out, I have only one recommendation for you: GET A TABLE.  If you do not get one, you will have to deal with the following:\\n\\n1) Rude ass bouncers both outside AND inside the club!  Yes, I understand you've been standing for hours herding and hustling people (most of whom are probably not fun to deal with, drunk or sober), but be professional.  You chose this job.  Or maybe you didn't.  In which case, it might be time to get that GED.  \\n\\n2) Crowds and crowds of people.  Maybe you're into that sort of thing, but I like to go to the club to dance, not have to deal with drunk white girls pushing me and screaming at me when I literally did not touch them and getting elbowed in the face and kneed in the back of my legs.  If you do not have a table, you will constantly be herded by the bouncers to places with no space.  You are NOT allowed to stand in walkways or enter dance areas that are already at full capacity.  If you stop to rest, a bouncer will yell at you.  If you stop to take off your heels to rest your feet (due to climbing an endless flight of stairs, see point #4), a bouncer will yell at you.  \\n\\n3) Nuclear levels of douchebaggery.  Some guy named Cash who is an employee of this fine establishment helped our entire party get in without a cover.  Honestly, I was thankful to him and wanted to just tip him for his generosity.  But we didn't, and he ended up spouting some nonsense to us about how he'll get us a table and free drinks.  Well, these \\\"free drinks\\\" ended up being $20 a pop and consisted of an 8 oz cup of club soda.  No alcohol.  My guess is Cash pocketed most of the cash and lived up to his name.  Uncool, dude.  No need for that type of play.  I would have rather he be upfront about things.  But that is exactly the type of BS that you'll have to deal with coming into a place like this. Naturally, Cash left to do his thang and the promise of free drinks and a table left with him.\\n\\n4) The stairs: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/WUq8HJHIZU4uteB154XN7w?select=JvT5VYkd_3HHLnrljGKv7w.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Whoever designed this club needs to be fired.\\n\\nMaybe more alcohol would have helped me tolerate the Marquee experience but alas, I'll never find out.  I'd rather spend my precious time and money on XS or Tryst.\n\nAnswer:",

The bests parts were lounging by the pool and the restaurant was excellent!\\n\\nThere were several disappointments though:\\n\\n- I was hoping to read on the rooftop in the morning, but they were doing construction on it (Saturday and Sunday morning, starting before 7am!). It woke us up and also caused power flickers/outages across the hotel. We never got to enjoy the rooftop, and weren't told about the construction when we checked in.\\n\\n- The $20 per night service fee wasn't exactly as promised. We learned that you have to explicitly ask at the front desk for everything that fee covers and they'll give it to you, if they have it...\\n\\n- Part of the fee covered sunscreen, which would have been great for the pool! They didn't have any though. When they run out they should get more, sunscreen would make trips to their pool so much better!\\n\\n- According to their web site the fee was also supposed to include a $20 gift card (per night) towards a future stay, but we didn't get it. I called the hotel to ask and they said they don't do that anymore. I left a message for the owner (at the same number) and within minutes the hotel called me back. Further proof that you really do need to ask for everything the service fee promises. I took a star off for this, but I'll give it back if the actually send me a gift card. Update: they said I could remind them next time and they'd take $20 off. Fail! I'm taking another star off, and I won't be staying here again.\\n\\n- The cheaper rooms overlook the pool, which is open 6am-midnight. The pool guests were pretty quiet, but the elevator music for the pool was not! We could hear it loud and clear in our room. Oddly enough I didn't even notice it when we were at the pool.\\n\\n- We booked through hotels.com, which said the hotel had microwaves in the rooms. Not true.\n\nAnswer:",

The guy working the register was friendly, and when I was 77 cents short he covered it for me, thus saving me a trip back to the car and another hit on my debit card. The girl who brought us our food was also very hospitable, getting me several condiments for my fries, and even suggesting I try their chipotle sauce (which I did, and it was decent). She also offered to get me a to-go cup for my drink when she noticed we were finished with our meals. It's rare, especially these days, to feel like the employees actually enjoy their jobs and take pride in making sure that the customer has a good experience. \\n\\nAs for the food, I got a 1/2lb BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and it was pretty damn good. Reminded me of a Fuddrucker's burger moreso than, say, In'n'Out or Five Guys, definitely a little different than the norm when it comes to burger joints.

The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so I would recommend calling ahead if you have a larger party (and they only seat your party once everyone has arrived, so keep that in mind, too).\\n\\nOur waitress was Leslie and she was wonderful from the very start.  Friendly and accommodating she allowed us a bit of time to look over the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences, which worked out nicely.  I had the Lo-Lo's meal and he had the Double D meal, we shared an order of cornbread, cause...who turns down southern style cornbread?? We opted to try out a couple of their drinks which I cannot remember the names of, but they were good! \\n\\nThe meals came out quickly an were exactly the way we ordered them and they smelled amazing. Chicken was cooked nicely and the breading was really well seasoned. Waffles were fluffy and perfect. The cornbread was gone within seconds of hitting the table. \\n\\nDespite being way too full for it, we shared a banana pudding for a dessert, which was worth every agonizingly over full bite! I highly recommend this if you from the south and like a good banana pudding with real slices of banana and wafer topping!\\n\\nOverall: A+\\nGreat service, great southern food with hilarious names (amazing dessert for a bonus), and fun ambiance make this place a \\\"will absolutely return\\\" venue!\n\nAnswer:",

I politely asked if he'd please check when he was done with (whatever he was doing). He gave me a head-nod (meaning: yes we've got milk)... Then he turned and started on the elderly couple (who also knew I was first, but they are jerks too). I didn't appreciate his crappy attitude or his opinion about my drink choice.

Plus, you must try Injera (Ethiopian flat bread). Also as a side note, their Ethiopian beer is surprisingly quite tasty; and it pairs well with the food. \\n\\nWhat will it taste like may you ask? Think of this, imagine for a second that if it was at all possible for a plate of delicious Indian cuisine to somehow mange reproduction with a full-of-flavor-and-spice plate of Persian cuisine with the ending result a sexy Ethiopian platter of food baby.

I understand and appreciate it's purpose, however what I don't understand is how they are still in business considering how they run the place.  I've been to this store COUNTLESS times between my own wedding, and several other weddings I have been a part of.  Most recently, I am the Matron of Honor in a friends wedding and we purchased the bridesmaid dress here. \\n\\nFirst off, when choosing the size for my dress, the girls measured me and told me to order a size six.  I am a small girl (or at least I like to think so), the previous wedding I was in, my dress size was a two - and I haven't gained weight.  Now, I could have ordered a different size, but the girls scared me so much I just ordered the six... fast forward several months later when I pick up the dress.  Surprise, surprise it doesn't even stay on.  So now I have to get major alterations.  Considering I don't usually get these kind of alterations I decide to get it done at the store because I figured they were the experts - WRONG choice.\\n\\nI make an appointment, which is hard to do on the limited schedule the alterations lady works.  I settle on a Friday in the middle of the day, causing me to have to leave work early.  Turns out the lady shows up 20 minutes late.  Then, when I picked up the dress she blew off my appointment assuming the dress will fit... well it didn't (again I left work early for the appointment).  Then, the lady says she can come back in an hour to fix it... I go home - 20 minutes later she is there and I have to rush back to the store to get the dress fixed.  There is more to the story, but I won't bore you.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the store owner offered me $35 dollars for my troubles... that's right $35 off of the $145 I paid for alterations--- BTW the dress cost me $120, so the alterations because I was convinced to order the wrong size cost more than the dress itself.  SO ANNOYED.\\n\\nI WON'T be back to this store.  I've bought so much here and now realize the lack of service is not worth my convince.  I promise I will be driving out of my way to get wedding related items in the future.\\n\\nP.S. They don't take American Express, which I find VERY annoying since it is the only credit card I carry.\n\nAnswer:",

It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. \\n\\nMy twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the \\\"good old days\\\" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.\\n\\nRustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.  \\n\\nBut!  You also get a cowboy hat.\\n\\nI have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).\\n\\nAs for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.\\n\\nFor the meal, I had the \\\"catch of the day\\\" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.  \\n\\nBut this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? \\n\\nProbably not.  But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns.\n\nAnswer:",

I have eaten here at least a dozen times. So why the 2 stars? The last 2 visits have been awful! The food quality has gone down dramatically and the service has went to shit. If you want to charge me $40 for an entree, you better have the proper service that is expected at that price point. I really think since the economy in Vegas has gone bad these places have cut back on food quality and servers to make up the difference. Screw that! You won't be getting my money and good riddance when you go out of business. I work hard for my money and I expect others to work hard for me when I spend it!\\n\\nI hope that this place can get it back together.

As Nicole W. mentioned, the flavors are super creative.  I had the strawberry lemonade and salted caramel bacon.  (But you could always choose from Siracha and White Russian!) \\n\\nFlavor is NOT lacking with these cupcakes. They're ultra moist, rich and unlike some bakeries where you can't tell what flavor a certain cupcake is...hoo-doggy.  You won't be confused with these.  The strawberry lemonade was slightly tart, and definitely sweet and lemony, with a strong strawberry-jam-like center.  The salted caramel bacon...this isn't like the trendy bacon cupcakes out there.  It's got a gooey-sticky-icky caramel center and nice meaty bacon flavor.  \\n\\nOne of my pet peeves is a skewed frosting-to-cake-ratio.  I can't stand cupcakes with mounds and mounds of frosting.  It's too much sweetness and ruins the proportions.  FuManChu doesn't do this.

When I first heard of the location I was like \\\"Gold Coast? Really?\\\" Yes, really as in they really blew me away in a lot of different ways. From the minute we went up the escalator to the ballrooms things just worked and went off without a hitch. Also the sound quality was very good and exceeded my expectations by a long shot and didn't hurt my ears or leave me cringing as other places tend to do. They advertise that they are \\\"equipped with ultra-modern lighting and sound systems\\\". I wouldn't go so far as to say ultra-modern but what they have flat out worked without fuss and was setup by someone who was very helpful and knew what they were doing. (Turning out individual lights above our screens without having to ask is attention to detail that I really like!) Our meeting space was one of the better ones I've been into at this size and price point in Vegas to date. And our food service was surprisingly good. If I wrote a Yelp review on the food service alone it would easily get 4 stars. (Iced tea that tasted like tea, a Caesar salad that didn't taste like bulk salad, a main plate that most people in our group finished off, and even the chocolate and carrot cakes didn't last very long on a lot of tables.)\\n\\nOverall my experience with the Gold Coast was not bad at all. I do wish they had variable message signing that could have welcomed our group like other places do. I also dislike the fact that many of our participants couldn't find the Arizona ballroom without having to ask for directions. Internal casino signage for the rooms demands improvement. And the other group using the ballroom across the hall was an interesting group to have next to our professional group with invited media personalities and others C-List type local celebrities in their own minds running amuk.  (Excluding a certain local media person who is very much respected in our circles). But that's a tangent and a story for another time. The Gold Coast is a great place to hold a meeting and I look forward to returning there in the not so distant future.\\n\\nDisclaimer: Some verbiage in this review was intentionally crafted to protect privacy while still giving me the opportunity to write a review. Protecting the not-so-innocent is a Vegas tradition (wink, wink)\n\nAnswer:",

It's always a great place to take folks who don't get to Vegas very often and don't know where to venture out to eat outside of their hotel.  \\n\\nThe Burger Bar has something for everybody.  They have a list of menu items they've put together as well as a create your own burger side.  Basically, you pick your bun, burger, cheese, vegetables, other toppings, and fries.  They have all kids of cheese, three or four types of bacon, many veggies, several types of onion, and even some uncommon items such as fois gras.  They have steak fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, seasoned fries, and zucchini fries.  You can pile it as high as you want.  The burgers are big and as delicious as you want to make them.  \\n\\nThey even have a few dessert burgers where a doughnut serves as the bun.  Originally, they only had one and it wasn't anything great to me.  Since then, they have added a few more options that I have yet to try.  Their milkshakes are delish as well.\\n\\nI usually make my own burger, but last time I ordered the sliders and they were very good.  It was a perfect choice when you're not hungry enough for a big burger.  The sliders are three mini burgers that are each different.  I'll definitely order that again.\\n\\nTime and time again, this is a great place and always has something for everyone, carnivores and herbivores alike.  I'm not sure about the vegan folks though...  They do get super busy and I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Roll up your sleeves, head to the Burger Bar and see who can build a better burger!\n\nAnswer:",

Chef's salad was probably the poorest one I have had in a long time.   Vegetables were fresh and of a sufficient quantity.   However,  the hard boiled egg was food service.

Well, being a southern California native and a Blatina (that's black Latina for those of you who don't know lol,,,it's okay, you can use it too), I have pretty high expectations for burritos. I've been running all over Charlotte looking for Mexican food that is at least comparable to the restaurants and taco shops posted on every corner of San Diego, and I'm sad to say that Phat Burrito fell short of my expectations. Funny thing is, I decided to check it out based on a good review posted by another former California resident. Now that you know a little bit about my background allow me to detail my experience at this place for you.\\n\\nThe Food: If my review were based solely on the food, I probably would have given Phat Burrito 3 stars. The burritos are served on really big tortillas that are stuffed to the max (if you need a comparison, think Chipotle). I ordered a chicken burrito which came packed with black beans, rice, chicken, cheese, and sour cream. Sounds really yummy right!? It was Aight. The rice was kind of undercooked and although there was plenty to nibble at, it was seriously lacking in flavor. The one plus was the fresh salsa bar (which usually comes standard at taco shops in Cali). I tried the green tomatillo salsa and it saved my burrito's life! It was mild and had an awesome combination of lime and cilantro that excited me. \\n\\nThe Place: Please be warned that if you read any further and you are a fan of Phat Burrito, your feelings may be hurt because I am about to be brutally honest. \\nThe parking lot was cramped (already been said), but there was plenty of parking when I went so I had no problem with that. The guy at the counter is responsible for the second star. He was super friendly and enthusiastic. Gave me a minute to explore the menu before asking if I needed help and offering his suggestions which I appreciated. I sat down to indulge in what I expected to be a mind-blowing burrito, and two women sat in the booth next to mine. Halfway through my PB, one of the ladies started making a discrete fuss about something. That's when I saw it! The roach crawling up the side of the counter! The awesome guy at the register was able to SPLAT it before it got too far, but I was still in shock. If there is one thing I abhor more than bad customer service when dining out, it's bug eyed bugs! C'mon now, even if you have a bug or two here and there (let's be real ppl, it happens more often than you'd think), at least keep it concealed while I'm eating lol. It did appear to be running in from the front door area so I  gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided he came from outside and that he was the only one. Needless to say, I was full. But THEN, on my way to my car I ran into a cockroach of a different sort. The old kind that likes to pick up and hit on seemingly innocent young ladies in the parking lot. Ironically he said he knew the owner and that he knew my experience had to have been top notch...I didn't have the heart (or the time) to tell him about what had just taken place. \\n\\nI realize that this is long, but I imagine it will help someone somewhere make an informed decision. I hate doing reviews like this because I know this place has a faithful customer base and a lot of potential, but until someone can assure me that they are pest free I don't think I can make my way back to give the burrito a second chance :(\n\nAnswer:",

I didn't think I was ever going back until I saw two separate articles from azcentral and new times on Chou's Kitchen.\\n\\nIt's tucked towards the end of a bland strip mall on the southwest corner of Ray and Alma School.  The decor is simple and clean.  We were seated and helped almost immediately.  I've been raving about these meat pies (don't you just love saying that word?) to my gf all day.  We got the pork meat pies, the bean curd with pork, noodles with shrimp, and green onion pancakes.\\n\\nThe meat pies were awesome.  Three came per serving.  They tasted like the filling of a pork steamed bun flattened with a flaky savory pastry crust around it.  Excellent.\\n\\nThe bean curd with pork and celery was crispy, fresh, and not too oily.  It wasn't bad but nothing to tell mom about.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the green onion pancakes had the look and aroma of deliciousness but lacked green onions to give it a punch.  It tasted like meat pies.. minus the meat.\\n\\nThe noodles with shrimp was standard fare.  Interestingly enough they used lo mein noodles instead of something thinner we thought they would.\\n\\nThey were nice enough to offer us a corn like clear soup, but it was very bland.  I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be savory or desert tasting.\\n\\nOverall, the meat pies are excellent at the place.  We spent $25 and came out full and happy.  It also helps the place was jam packed with asian people which is a good sign.  Next time, I'm going to go back and try some of their soup/stews that I saw everyone else ordering, and I may change my rating.\n\nAnswer:",

Had to go back to see some old friends and stayed at the Fiesta. We don't spend more than 6 hours in our room, so the price was right. \\nI love the buffet here at the Texas. Being a former resident, I have tried the Rio, Bellagio yada yada.  It's almost the exact same thing but it's definitely $15-$20 cheaper here. I had the breakfast Buffet and I was totally satisfied.  \\nNow when the lunch crowd came in, that's where it almost ruined it for me. Tourist's do not control their kids! So many brats running around, their mom's with full to overflowing plates in each fat fist - and not one kid was told to settle down or behave. I would've applauded any mother to actually slap a kid!  My husband nearly got knocked over near the pizza/ italian section - ( And he is 6'4!!). There was one kid who was taking bites out of cookies and putting them back on the tray at the desert station (gross) . I was embarrassed as I know for a fact, most of those tourists come from right here in So Cal.\\nJust because you are on vacation - please don't subject perfect strangers to your bad ass, juvenile delinquent kids.\\nI used to work at a large casino on the Strip, and have come to the realization that, most tourists are gouged when staying at a big resort when they would be better off saving some of that hotel money for something else. Maybe a show or a nice dinner. How many of you actually spend more than 4 to 5 hours at a time in the room anyway? See the sights...like Red Rock Canyon or Hoover Dam, there is more to Las Vegas than the Strip.\n\nAnswer:",

I remember my fiance, then boyfriend, and I would eat here back in High School, and we still try to make the long drive out every once in awhile to have some of the most authentic Mexican food available in this town.

Not too sweet and not too watery!\\n\\nAs far as service goes, it is typically good.

The main reason I did it was not because it was a nicer room but rather, for the parking.  The woman at the front desk told me they had special valet parking with an entrance on Flamingo.  It had just taken me 30 minutes to go 1 1/2 blocks on the strip, so that benefit alone was worth the upgrade.  I picked up my wife at the airport about an hour later (she had arrived that evening) and we zipped into the valet without having to deal with the strip traffic.  I was very pleased until I was told that unless I was a \\\"Diamond\\\" or \\\"Seven Seas\\\" card level, I couldn't park there.  When I informed the valet what the lady at the front desk said and why I upgraded the room, he just said sorry and when they were full that didn't apply (he then preceded to direct me to the Forum Shops valet...which is all the way down by self parking.....what's the point?!).  When I complained to their customer service, the witch on the phone said since I didn't appear to be happy with the arraignment, we could just pack our bags and move to the room we originally had.  Imagine that.  They upsell me on false pretenses, it takes me a total of 45 minutes to get back to the hotel after being redirected, and now she wants to inconvenience me more by packing up!  I let her have it and insisted on talking to a manager.  He apologized for her behavior and gave me a $75 food credit.  Might I suggest to management that if there is some stipulation on your service, you sure as hell should mention it when you're upselling someone.  I wouldn't have wasted my time or money on it if I knew it wasn't guaranteed (and your Front Desk person knew that by the comments I made to her)\\n\\nAs for the casino itself, the best analogy I could give is a person living in a small town and going to New York.  The place has gotten too big for it's own good (and their staff doesn't seem well equipped to deal with the traffic).  No matter where you went, it was a long walk.  Ironically, for such a huge area, their table area is rather small.  There's very little about this place that's relaxing (I usually stay at the Wynn and it's much more enjoyable).  Their new buffet, Bacchanal, has lines the size of the bigger attractions at Disneyland (it was an hour and a half wait on Saturday night).  Of course, if you were a \\\"Diamond\\\" or \\\"Seven Seas\\\" member you got to cut the line (or you could pay a $20 line pass....hilarious).  Once inside, there were still lines everywhere.  \\n\\nOn the day we were checking out, I had to wait 2 hours to cash a sports ticket because their computer were down.  When I went to the \\\"special\\\" Octavius Tower registration desk, the woman said her computers had limited access, so she couldn't print my boarding pass and directed me to the Front desk.  The woman at the Front desk seemed annoyed that I had taken her away from some paperwork (keep in mind this was at 3:30am...we had a plane at 6).  She said the concierge normally takes care of that and they weren't open until 8 so I would have to go to a \\\"paid\\\" kiosk by the Total Reward Center.  Again annoyed, I went back to the Octavius Registration.  There was another lady there and she said she could print my boarding pass.  After 4-5 minutes she said she couldn't find my reservation.  I told her I was sure it was right.  Somehow the woman thought my first name was my last name (not exactly a common mistake).  I truly have to wonder when this hotel hires people if the manager just puts a mirror under their nose, and if it fogs up, you're hired.  Seriously, there are a lot of brain dead people at this hotel.  They also treat anyone that isn't a \\\"Diamond\\\" or \\\"Seven Seas\\\" member like crap.  When I'm at the Wynn, they certainly roll out the carpet for their high rollers (yeah, I get it), but they treat everyone else nice also.  There's no reason why you can't do both.  I never even notice the difference in service at the Wynn and am always treated very nicely.  I don't care what kind of deal I get at this place when I go back to Vegas, I won't be staying here again.\\n\\nP.S.  I was just reminded about their marketing of their \\\"no resort fees\\\".  If you and your partner use internet, it's a joke.  They'll make more off of you then the resorts that offer a \\\"resort\\\" fee.  We paid on average about $10 more per day and luckily we didn't go to the gym (yeah, that's extra also).  The \\\"no resort fees\\\" ploy is just a gimmick for them to make more money.\n\nAnswer:",

According to a dated publication posted on the restaurant's wall,  it was the owner's long time dream to open a restaurant.  The publication shocks me for two reasons: the restaurant is dirty and the food is awful... that doesn't feel dreamy to me.   I ordered the sliders.  The wife ordered a turkey club sandwich.  Safe bets considering this is our first visit.  It was hard to find an open table and that's not because the restaurant was busy (at the top of the lunch hour, we were the only patrons)... we couldn't find a clean table.  I guess the dream didn't factor in employees who would rather drink lattes and watch football games than clean tables and floors.  Then came the food. The sliders were clumsily made, the onion straws were cold,  and the mac n' cheese was unseasoned and bland.  My wife's  sandwich was mediocre and  elementary (in my lazy college days, I made better sandwiches with half the sobriety of the restaurant cooks... granted I'm making a big assumption). In short, save your money and spare yourself the nightmare... find another spot.\n\nAnswer:",

One issue has been the bread---which used to be nothing short of awesome.  One a couple of recent visits (off the lunch time rush) the bread tasted like it had been sitting around (in one case, the sandwich was inedible).  A second issue has been seasoning, which used to be perfect.  In one case, the sandwich lacked any taste and in another case, the moz was unevenly salted.  All of these are \\\"sins\\\" that are excusable from an ordinary sandwich shop with ordinary prices.  (Well, the inedible sandwich isn't excusable...)

They got us in right away on a Friday, which was great. I was not impressed, however, with the exam. It felt like the doctor was not thorough, more focused on keeping our cat calm and comfortable. My cat didn't like her trying to look in her mouth (surprise!), so she mentioned that it could be dental. Unsure of what the problem could be, we gave the go ahead on labs and were sent on our way with nothing more for a cat that wasn't eating much and acting lethargic. I got a call with the results and they were normal. He then hard sold me on a dental exam and possible extractions that would total over $1,000. I wasn't buying it, since she began eating again shortly after the visit (switched to wet foods), and had no other signs of major dental disease. \\n\\nFast forward two weeks, I have to take my cat in again because she's in extreme discomfort. I took her to Arrow Animal Hospital, where the doctor performed a thorough examination and (gasp) looked in her mouth and determined that it wasn't a dental issue (saved us $400 right there...). She did X-rays, which showed enlarged kidneys and a swelling pancreas. \\n\\nI can't help but doubt myself for not getting a second opinion sooner. Something no pet owner should ever have to worry about. I'm sorry, but missing enlarged kidneys and pancreas issues is pretty bad. That's life-threatening. It seemed like they were content with calling it a day and collecting a large amount on the dental exam. I'm sure that would've helped with her kidneys, right? Ugh.\n\nAnswer:",

The festival lasted from 11am - midnight and was filled with performances, food, and booths from local organizations.  Yes, it was a hot and I wished they had more covered seating, but that is the benefit of going in groups.  This way you just have to rotate who is going to get the food and who is going to hold the fort down in the shade. \\n\\nLogistics:  Tickets were $8 at the door ($5 for pre-sale at local shops and restaurants around the valley).  This event was also very family friendly and free for children 8 and under.  Once you got in you there was a line to buy tickets for Ramen ($7), soda ($2), and beer ($5).  Warning though the beer was cheaper $3-$4 from the non Ramen booths.  From 12 pm to 1 pm this line was super super long, but after 1 pm it definitely died down.  If you wanted other food like skewers and Okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) no ticket required, just good old hard cash.\\n\\nHiromaru: By far the longest of the Ramen lines and for good reason.  It has a very rich and creamy broth without being overpowering.  The noodles were on the thinner side which I personally like because I feel like I get more broth with what I am eating. This one did steal the show in most everyone's heart.  They are originally from Japan, but the flyers said that they were going to open a shop here in Vegas and I will be a future customer for sure.\\n\\nIroha: Another festival favorite.  They had the second longest line.  Their noodles were much thicker and their broth had a little more spice to it.  The servers warned us that it was spicy, but I didn't think it was bad at all.  \\n\\nVegetable Okonomiyaki - Lots of fillings, heavy on the pickled ginger, and still squishy on the inside.  I like it, but if you a super crispy pancake this might not have fit your fancy.\\n\\nI had a wonderful time eating and drink from the different booths, hanging out with friends, and even my failed attempts at Roshambo (rock paper scissors) to win gift certificates for local restaurants.  I'm pretty sure I will be back next year :)\n\nAnswer:",

I am here doing a 4800sf remodel. I've also been busy with other handyman jobs.  I took a list of what I am replacing on the remodel, sizes counts, etc. to the Pro-Shop. they were very responsive as long as you are in the store. They were going to get the  information on things like closet doors. the one I am replacing has three 36\\\" doors with two tracks. Their closet expert was not in so they asked me to come back to speak with him. meanwhile another person was going to track most of the other items down for me.\\nI went back to the \\\"expert\\\" and was told I should just go to Johnson supply. I didn''t get any information on options, styles etc. \\nWell, I've been doing this for awhile so I can and usually find the best deals. I have been doing small jobs since relocating to Vegas a year ago.  When I am pressed for time and I am not sure of a size or color, etc. I usually buy  a couple of a product to avoid having to go back and forth. A couple of month ago I took several item that had accumulated over time to the  return desk at 9pm on a weeknight. I have a couple items I purchased at this store the day before. the girl said it was not their item, they did not sell it. when I explained I just bought it the day before she said I must be mistaken. I turned around went to the isle across from customer service desk picked it off the shelf and walked another one back  to her. She didn't acknowledge her mistake and proceeded to do the same thing with two other items. I had forgotten my receipt and my DL was not in my wallet. So I had to return the next day. That night I told her I had picked up an order the day before and asked if anyone turned in a DL. She said NO. After leaving I realized, she didn't even check, or ask anyone.  This girl had serious attitude issues. About a week later I was at the return desk again. the lady there was very nice an helpful. My situation was going to take a few minutes so she tols the guy behind me to go over to customer service desk.....guess who was there. 60 seconds later, she was yelling to the girl helping me complaining she was sent a customer. \\n\\nThis particular store needs new management. I've had two other issues with employees there with attitudes or questioning the (correct) information I am giving them. I have recently spent 6k. at LOWES since I no longer go to this store. I have also taken my customers to LOWES for materials. I think in the year I have lived here I have taken 12,000.00 in business to them. Plus the  things I needed to buy for this remodel. \\n\\nI did email HD about this store. I have to say, they were very anxious to discuss my issues with me.  Unfortunately, I has very busy that week.  HD does not mess around when it comes to customer satisfaction. if you ever have an issue with a store, their employees, management, etc. so to the website and email customer support.  you'll be surprised by  their response.  great business model. unfortunately, some stores need better management. this store will cost them over 20k. in business over the next 30 to 60 days, its all going to LOWES or amazon.\n\nAnswer:",

It's only been open a week so it was packed! If you don't get there before 10 pm expect to wait in a long line and not find a table to park your drinks at.  The ambience is very cool and it is pretty big, there actually are a lot of tables both inside and out. There are 4 cabanas on the outside patio that you can reserve if you have a large group and promise to spend at least $300, which is very easy to do with a large group. The sand and small pool are a nice touch, I did get a little sand in my shoes but didn't mind one bit. The dance floor isn't huge but it doesn't get too packed we always found a spot to comfortably shake our groove things, the DJ plays hip hop, some rock and even a little country while they show the videos on the flat screens, they even played SNL's digital short On a Boat with Andy Samberg & T-Pain which is very danceable and very hilarious.  \\n\\nNow we did have a few issues but I think it's based on the fact that this place is new and so so packed and management did try to make amends so I'm not going to knock them too much for it. It was my sister's birthday so we called in advance to reserve a cabana for the night but then they called us back a day later and said they had actually overbooked so we no longer had the cabana, we then made reservations for dinner but once we got there they did not have a spot for us to sit, they had anticipated another big party would leave before we got there and they did not, so we had to go somewhere else for food, but the manager offered my sister free drinks when we came back later and they did reserve us some high tops by the dance floor when we came back so that was nice. We never had to wait too long for our waitress to come back around and offer more drinks either, another plus.\\n\\nAlso because it is so packed there is more of a possibility of having a few knucklheads in the crowd, we actually saw a fight early in the night, small and squashed quickly. Then later in the evening some drunky tried to fight a guy in our group, I think this drunky had little man complex and he was in the crowd and he bumped into our friend at the same time that someone else bumped into him so he thought our friend purposely bumped him. Our friend was actually the designated driver so he was completely sober and the drunk 5 foot tall guy tried to fight the sober 6 foot tall guy who kept telling him to walk away, which he did, only to come back later with his 5 1/2 foot tall friend to avenge him. It was all stupid and the management could see that it was just two drunk guys trying to prove they weren't scared of the big guy and they kicked the knuckleheads out and let us stay.  The night was saved and we actually stayed until the last song at 2 a.m. chit chatting and dancing the night away.\\n\\nI will definitely go back, maybe not for a few weeks when it isn't so crowded but with it being one of the few dance spots in Chandler this probably won't happen any time soon, which is good for them. We went on a Saturday but I've heard Friday is just as packed.\n\nAnswer:",

I called at 10:11AM on Monday and the Gal on the phone told me to come by at 12:30PM, because that's when they would be open and I could come in and pick out a dozen cupcakes. So, my sister, my 5 year old niece, 7 week old niece, and I went shopping near by to kill two hours. For some reason NOTHING in Las Vegas is close by, the freeway and highway are all so round about, it takes you almost 30 minutes to get anywhere. Anyway, we came back at 12:30 on the dot and the place still was not open. I went up to the door to check and one of those generic clock signs said, be back at and the clock arms pointed to 1PM. Disappointed, I got back in the car, told my sister the situation, and waited. My sister had to make a phone call, so she agreed to wait. 1:00PM came and went, at 1:10PM I called the number again this time with no answer and I left a message, with no returned phone call. A nice Gal, who I assume owns the pizza place, said that the HottCakez owner was there, because her bar is near the back, and she saw them back there. The place never opened...\\n\\nNeedless to say, we didn't get any cupcakes as promised and we will NEVER be going back. Customer service is horrible. If you can't deliver, don't tell me to come back and then NOT answer your phone. I don't mind coming back another day, just let me know. Just because I'm a Groupon buyer, doesn't make me less of a customer. I spent money already, and haven't even tried your product, and now because of you, I never will.

There isn't one thing on the menu that I enjoy. Not even the chips and salsa. How can you mess up chips and salsa??\\n\\nEVERYONE I know loves this place. I feel like I'm an alien. Maybe they put something in their food that not only makes you bleed when you go the bathroom, but also hypnotizes you to think they have the best food when really its the worst.\\n\\nMy two most recent experiences are as follows:\\n\\nA friend of mine insisted we go before a movie. I asked him if he really wanted to eat that garbage and then sit for two hours but he said yes. I watched him eat a burrito while I ate stale chips and the cashier made fun of me (YES HE MADE FUN OF ME! WHO DOES THIS?) for not ordering something. He actually asked me if I was watching my figure. I'm a skinny girl so it was really insulting to the bigger girls behind me in line. I could tell they were visibly offended.\\n\\nAnother time my boyfriend got a coupon for a free burrito for selling his books back to the school. I guess they figure that if you're stupid enough to sell your books back to the school instead of online then you're stupid enough to eat Chipotle. I went with him even if I didn't want anything. I just wanted to spend time with him. Well apparently everyone and their mother wanted Chipotle that day because the line was so long it went outside. The door was open so it was hot. Imagine every possible thing that could go wrong in a line happening at once. That's what it was. Sweaty people all over, screaming kids, crying babies, loud cell phone talkers, cutters.... Ugh. When we finally reached the front of the human labyrinth they almost didn't take his coupon even though it was completely valid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the end.

Don't misunderstand me, this place is not expensive at all, we're just jaded a bit in this town with sushi prices based on the ayce model. \\n\\nThis place is refreshing! Small bar and dining that makes the quaintness of the place cozy as opposed to cramped.\\nThe Service is Superb! You feel as if you are a guest rather than a customer. \\nThe quality is exactly what you'd hope to find at a REAL Sushi Bar. Top quality ingredients with great attention to detail not only with Chef Aki  mastering his craft but from the kitchen staff as well. Chef Aki's rolls are very artistically done with much pride and enthusiasm as you might be able to tell from photos (try the Hello Kitty Roll).\\n\\nThe bonus to this place is their daily lunch special. Each day of the week has a different Bento Box Special  priced at just $5. McDonald's across the way can't match that price.

Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food.

See a Las Vegas Wranglers hockey game of course. The first annual Indoor Winter Classic to be precise. A game early enough in the afternoon that a young family can enjoy without the little ones getting crabby. A game where it snows indoors at regular intervals. A game that the home team wins with a final score of 3-2. Today was a great time. This is the third game I've been to and each time I have a lot of fun. Whether for todays Winter Classic, the charitable Guns and Hoses game (cops vs fire department in conjunction with the Wranglers), or just a general regular season game. I wish Las Vegas would get behind the Wranglers a little more than they do. They have been around for 10 seasons and have performed well.

Last time I ate here was almost 6 months ago. I really love the I-Naba chain. Back when I was still living in Los Angeles County, they had a I-NABA in the South Bay area. The one thing I remember about the place was how good they treated my Dad on account of him being such a popular figure in the Los Angeles Japanese-American community. I always thought it was funny how they always kissed his ass and treated him like royalty. At this Las Vegas location, they never heard of him. \\n\\nWhen people say that I-Naba is the best Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, I can easily understand why people would say that. This place has introduced a dish which is extremely popular in Japan to the morbidly uncultured people of Las Vegas. Even though I personally believe that Shogu and Hiro's famous \\\"Sushi-on-Rainbow\\\" restaurant is the best and even the most culturally significant Japanese restaurant in LV, I can see why some people may say I-NABA is the bees nees. In fact, I agree that I-NABA is much greater than Ichiza or any of the poke-MON restaurants.  \\n\\nI love buckwheat soba. I really love buckwheat soba. I have eaten Zaru Soba every single night for the last 6 months. It's a great source of complex carbohydrates, and it helps keep my weight down. If you are a narcissistic pretty boy like me, I really recommend replacing your carb source with buckwheat soba. It gives you that energy you need to workout hard, with the fiber and health benefits as an added bonus.  \\nEvery Zaru Soba fan would much prefer to go to one of these soba places that actually have their noodles specifically made for their restaurant. You can get Zaru Soba at Shuseki and Ichiza but they use the same noodles that you get at places like Nakata Market of Japan or Japan Creek Market. Don't get me wrong, I ain't knocking Shuseki. In fact, Shuseki is my favorite noodle house in Vegas, but when you taste the freshly made noodles at I-NABA, you will immediately recognize the difference in taste. \\n\\nThe girl who works here is really fun to talk with. Last time I was here we had a conversation about Japanese identity. She is half-Japanese/White, and I'm half-Japanese/Korean. So, it was one of the more interesting conversations I have had this year. \\n\\nI-NABA also holds the unique title of having my very favorite Vegetable Tempura.  The vegetables they use taste organically grown, and they slice them so nice in that symmetrically perfect style. I really like places that make their own Tempura dipping sauce in house. I can only think of 2 other places in LV that do this(SushiTwister and Sushi on Rainbow). \\n\\nI really wish I could eat here everyday or at least more often. Problem is that I work 60 hours 7 days a week. By the time I get off work this place is usually closed. I heard that they might start opening later when they get their liquor license. I hope it's soon.\n\nAnswer:",

I think this is where they filmed 21.  Anyway, craps tables here are really good.  The circle bar is ok, you get a lot of cougars that come through.

Everyone comes here for their massive Bingo Room or if they want to go bowling.

There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.\\n\\nThere is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like. We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time. You see everything and are ready to leave by the end.

Most definitely, the Wynn does the job when it comes to making every food into a gourmet dish that could have easily been served as an entree (or an appetizer).  Case in point was the gazpacho.  I don't think we've ever had an a la carte gazpacho that tasted so good.  We could taste the ground apples and other ingredients - it was so fresh.\\n\\nThe shrimp cocktail (for those fellow shrimp fans) were jumbo and, ginormous.  The King Crab legs were fairly decent, but not over-the-top astounding.  The seafood selection was definitely decent.  \\n\\nHowever, the draw to the Wynn is not the untouched foods such as the crab legs or the salmon, but that which takes effort to create (e.g., some of the pasta, the soups, and I have never seen pizza at a buffet look so delectable).\\n\\nThe reason I did not give this five stars, however, was because I still prefer the Bellagio buffet, despite the Wynn's impressive high-end ambience and food preparation.  I believe the Bellagio does it best when it comes to the raw ingredient quality - from the variety of king to dungeness crab, to the Scottish salmon.\n\nAnswer:",

Drinks were not refilled until I had to walk me and a friends glasses up to the counter to ask for refills. Food was alright... For the price I was not impressed with freshness or taste. Plates were not cleared as courses came out and again our server, a middle aged man, seemed angry and as though he was trying to rush us. Lastly on my second trip to the counter to request refills on water, I saw the same server opening a mochi package from trader joes and cutting the pieces into fourths.

It was my first time here so perhaps I had higher expectations, but that never really came through. After taking my girl out to the Grand Concourse and Eleven for previous special occasions, I decided to surprise her for our anniversary by setting up reservations at the Le Mont. Upon request, I had made reservations for a Saturday night in March at 7pm and asked for a window seat being that we've never been there before and since we were celebrating something special.\\n\\nThe place is elegant, don't get me wrong. I was quite taken back by how amazing the interior and exterior were decorated. My girl, being an architect and interior designer was in awe of the place and barley spoke to me as she was taking it all in. We liked the old school feel to it. It made us feel like we were in an episode of AMC's Mad Men dining so elegantly. We got a nice seat by the window, unfortunately it was a very dreary night so there was hardly any visibility. My luck of course haha.\\n\\nWe were excited to get some drinks to start, but after looking over their cocktail list, there really wasn't anything special that caught our eyes. I was kind of expecting some interesting/different cocktails that I've never heard of before but not much out of the ordinary. I settled for a Manhattan on the rocks, and she a Dirty Martini. Both were made very well though.\\n\\nFor starters, we got the shrimp bruscheta. It was actually really good. Small tomato's, red onion, cheese, greens, and a vinaigrette dressing delicately garnished the dish. For my first side, I got a salad which was very generic. It actually kinda disappointed me. There was enough french dressing drenching the vegetables that it could have been used for three salads. My girl opted for the lobster bisque soup as her first side and it was quite delicious. I wish I had ordered that instead as I kept dipping the bread we were given in her bisque. \\n\\nFor our main dish, we both had ordered some kind of fillet off their Winter Menu which came with a soup or salad, your main dish with starch and veggies, and a desert of your choice. The fillet itself was good. Bigger than I expected actually. It was wrapped in bacon and covered in peppercorns. I enjoyed it, my girl thought there was too much peppercorn on it though and she had to scrap allot of it off. The \\\"starch\\\" that came with the fillet was just bland. It was like half steak fry, half home fry. That sounds good to me, but they were pretty soggy as if they had been sitting in a vat all evening under a heat lamp.  Also big long carrot sticks and asparagus came as the veggies. Carrots, I'll pass on that and the asparagus was ok, but once again nothing special in that department...\\n\\nThe best part of the night were our deserts. I got the pecan ball which was pretty good and she got the creme brulee which tasted amazing. \\n\\nOur bill for 3 drinks and 2 winter special en tree's (once again you got a soup or salad, main course with starch and veggies, and a desert) came to about $120 without the tip.\\n\\nFor how much I wanted to like the place and enjoy it and say we'll be back again, I'm not too sure about it. Maybe for drinks and appetizers in the future. Don't get me wrong, the place is gorgeous, the view is equally as good, even the valet parking was cheap for a Saturday night, but when I compare this meal/experience we've had to the Grand Concourse or Eleven (which you can also read about in my previous reviews) this experience just wasn't up to that level. The food just didn't seem to be hot out of the pan and fresh. Soggy potato's and veggies, kind of a warped salad, a little too heavy on the seasonings. This stuff is all easily fixable with some good plate presentation and fresh out of the oven/skillet consistency though.\\n\\nIf your looking for a special place to get dressed up and impress your girl or entertain the family for a special event you might want to try it out. By no means was it terrible, but as I see its a 5 start restaruant I thought I would critique it a bit more than other places I've been too.\\n\\nHappy eatings my fellow Yelpers!\\nYour's Truely, The Shaw...\n\nAnswer:",

Anywayyys, bouncers were nice and they made our transition inside the club pretty smoothly. Once we got in, I immediately noticed how SMALL it was. The dancefloor was sooooo tiny! :( When I finally made my way over, I could barely move/dance. It was literally body to body ... and this was on a day where there's NO ONE famous dj-ing! So imagine how bad the crowd would get if Tiesto or Hardwell was up there .... I wouldn't wanna be there! \\n\\nBut that's all I can really say because I got super messed up and I can't remember anything else. Only that I couldn't dance at all because there was no room and the parts where it's kinda open, the security made you move :(\n\nAnswer:",

Well, this restaurant totally fit the bill to a tee.  It's a small, quaint place (translated:  not many tables).

While waiting, we sat at the bar and perused the menu full of sushi roll options and a limited but worthy entree list.\\n\\nOnce seated, we opted for a bottle of wine (and, as with all restaurants, the markup is significant) and ordered two of the entrees -- chilean see bass and snapper.

I heard it was $35 but I guess they maybe jacked up the price for the I Heart Radio weekend.\\n\\nTip: Each person in your group should get a player's card to save $3 on the buffet.  (the $39 was after the discount)\\n\\nMy thoughts on the buffet...\\n\\nFood - AMAZING! They have so much variety from Asian, Italian, Mexican, American, etc. They have BBQ pork ribs, beef brisket, tomohawk steaks,truffled potato, sweet potato fries, seafood like crab legs, shrimp, and mussels. They have dim sum, ramen and pho!  If you like hot crab legs, ask the chefs to get it for you from the back.  They don't put the hot ones out in front for some reason, only the cold ones.\\n\\nOnly bad thing was no fruit for dinner except if you can find them as toppings from the desserts. Some desserts to name a few arecrepes, cupcakes, cakes, creme brulee, gelato, tiramisu, mousse, souffles, and cake pops.  Desserts looked great but wish they tasted better.\\n\\nPresentation - Super cute! It's very similar to the presentation at Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo.  They have their fried chicken in mini frying baskets and mini ketchup bottles.  The amount of desserts were impressive but I wish they spent more time of the taste of it instead of how it looked.  \\n \\nService - POOR.  I understand they were crazy busy but our waitress would forget one drink and bring another.  She wouldn't take our plates away without being asked.  I expected better service for the price you pay.\\n\\nIf you're a vegetarian, you should probably stay away.  You would not get your money's worth at this buffet.\n\nAnswer:",

The d\\u00e9cor is luxurious; the waiters were helpful and pleasant; and every morsel of food was packed with complex flavors. \\n\\nAs many reviewers have pointed out, don't be shy with the bread cart. You're paying good money for this meal, so go for it! I chose five breads, and each one was memorable. My favorite was the gruyere brioche, because it was delicate and flaky but had a pronounced cheese flavor.\\n\\nAs for the amuse bouche, it is crab mixture topped with caviar. This was my first bit of caviar, and I wasn't too thrilled with it, but I can't blame Joel for that because it's a matter of taste. If you know that you don't like caviar, I recommend that you ask for an alternate amuse bouche. My boyfriend is allergic to seafood, so he asked for an alternate when we were ordering. The waiter was very understanding and produced a cold beat soup. I know beet soup doesn't sound appetizing, but it was delicious. \\n\\nI order le sole for my main dish, and I was very pleased. The sauce was silky and savory. My boyfriend order some sort of red meat dish. He didn't seem to be crazy about the meat, but he really liked the accompanying vegetables, which says a lot because he doesn't eat a lot of vegetables.  \\n\\nMy desert, le chocolat, was divine. I adore ice cream, and the coffee ice cream was the best that I've ever eaten. The dish also had melted chocolate and fresh whipped cream, which made every bite different. \\n\\nJust like the bread cart, don't be shy with the desert cart. I chose five different desert morsels. I recommend the five spice chocolate and the strawberry cheesecake with liquor. The five spice chocolate tasted like the love child of a pumpkin pie and a chocolate truffle. The cheesecake was a wonderful surprise, because it appears to be a firm ball when you hold it, but it almost explodes in your mouth. You could say it was a flavor explosion. \\n\\nThis review was much longer than I intended, but I couldn't stop typing. That's how much I loved Joel.\n\nAnswer:",

The group dining experience was not even close to the intimate date I had there a couple months ago. \\n\\nI went with a pretty big group this time (nearly 20 people), and the earliest we were able to make a reservation on a Friday night was 8:45. We met for a drink next door, and all arrived at exactly that time, but the wait was still more than 10 minutes. We had to sit at two tables that were perpendicular to each other. It was a big group, so I'm not knocking off any points for that.

We were in the Mardi Gras tower. The 1st impression when we walked into out room was omg!!! I need to stay somewhere else! There was a heavy perfume smell as we walked in that was so powerful...next my eyes went straight to the bed where there was a big gross stain on the carpet...still I tried to relax and take it all in. There is adjoining doors to the room next to us which you can hear everything happening. To top it off a sticker saying at night please make sure to put the dead bolt on. There was an event on the Saturday and our room was $300 for the night...at that price I decided to complain. They were great about it and got us a new room.\\n\\nThe new room was still in Mardi Gras tower but had a small balcony and had no odor. The new room was way cleaner and the hallway leading to our room was brightly lit compared to previous room.\\n\\nThe only great thing about Harrahs is the location which is central to everything. \\n\\nThe smoke became overwhelming...most casino's have great ventilation. If you don't smoke I highly recommend you don't stay here!\\n\\nOK next is the spa...they had a pumpkin  sugar pedicure for $60 that sounded nice. I went to the spa and they direct me to this little room with two pedicure chairs. This room is painted white with nothing in it. It was literally like a closet. Then as my pedicure is going on I notice the tools are in a dirty old make up box and the lady simply wiped off the tools and put them back in her kit. No disinfectant!  I was disappointed and disgusted. The spa was the worst experience I have ever had in a spa.\\n\\nThey say they offer WiFi, it is so terrible if you need to use WiFi it Wil cost you! The free WiFi barely works.\\n \\nAfter our stay they refunded the incorrect amount for the deposit on our credit card after many phone calls we decided to cut our losses and forget the $27 they ripped off us. \\n\\nIn vegas there is so many awesome places to stay Harrahs is not one of them!\n\nAnswer:",

This review will be the later, and I apologize because it's going to be lengthy. \\n\\nWe rarely, and I mean rarely, go out to eat, but I had heard such great reviews for DC Steak House so I figured... why not? Let me tell you why not. We make our \\\"necessary reservations\\\" which takes me three times to get through because I am not comfortable just \\\"leaving a message\\\" and assuming it was listened to (not very professional). We get there at our designated time, and the place is practically empty (ok... so we needed reservations why? People were just walking in and sitting down!). The hostess was wearing a see through top that one would wear to a club, shorty shorts, and a boyfriend cartigan and gladiator sandals(how does this scream \\\"upscale\\\"???)\\n Our waitress was extremely nice, and one reason I feel bad for writing a negative review because she was pleasant... however, after we got our appetizers, things just went downhill. After about 50 minutes, we noticed the people that had come in after us were not only getting their food, but had finished their dinner and were paying before our waitress FINALLY came over and apologized for \\\"putting our order in AFTER her party of 6\\\". Fine. We patiently wait for our food, and once it arrives, we both thanked the heavenly God's because we were starving. \\nMy boyfriend despises a lot of red/pink, but he doesn't mind a little, so he ordered medium-well. I love red/pink, so I ordered medium-rare. He got what is typically a medium-rare steak (some cooked, some red/pink, perfection!) and mine was so rare I could have rolled it up, smashed it down, and threw it on the grill for a nice steak burger. Disgusting. The mushrooms, which I would have typically loved, were so slimy I took one bite and actually started gagging at the table. I had to look for the bathroom in case I were to actually get sick (this has NEVER happened to me). \\nNeedless to say, I was not even going to attempt to eat anything else the rest of the night.\\nSo the waitress comes back, asks how everything is, and we explain the dilemma of the wrongly-cooked steaks. She apologizes and takes mine back to be cooked more and bagged (since I only took 2 bites of my 9 oz filet mignon... I was not about to waste my money). She brings my box over and my boyfriend asks for the manager.\\nThe Manager was a JOKE. I am a young female in business (management), so it pains me to say this, but she was extremely unprofessional, and I am shocked anyone would trust her to take care of \\\"complaints.\\\" She kept tilting her head from side to side, blinking constantly, and would stare off into the distance rather than looking at us directly. She would ask questions that made it seem like WE were in the wrong (like: \\\"what size steak did you get? oh, yes, that is a thick steak, so medium-well will be less rare....\\\" as if we know your cooks don't know to leave thicker steaks on for longer... OUR BAD). She attempted 3 times to give us a free dessert (which neither one of us wanted), and once my boyfriend said \\\"we probably will not be back\\\" she disengages and says \\\"that's too bad\\\" and walks off. Color me silly, but wouldn't a professional manager do something other than shrug and walk off one that is said? YOU DON'T LET MONEY WALK OUT OF THE DOOR!!!!!!!!!!! She did comp our appetizer (again our complaint was against our $30 steaks, not our $4 appetizer) which was nice, but seriously ridiculous. \\nI don't know when these people with great reviews are going, but it is CLEARLY not when this \\\"D-squad\\\" staff is there.\\nI would NEVER go back. From the other posts I've read on here, I'd say it's safe to avoid if possible.\\nI've also noticed the manager or gm does not respond to any posts on here... they need to get their head out of the sand and read these reviews and FIX their problems.\n\nAnswer:",

A few other reviewers complained about the fact that Scottsdale caters to members and puts members in the front of the line. Ahhh of course they do - IT'S A CLUB so members should and do always get to use the club first, visitors second. \\n\\nMy only other critic of the club is that many times it is difficult to find someone to help when you are looking to purchase. Dark blue shirts are newbies and work the register and range checkin - black shirts do the selling and red shirts are management and trainers. \\n\\nIt can be frustrating when you want to see a firearm or have a question and you ask a blue shirt - they sorta look at you like huh!\\n\\nSo if you want to buy - find someone with a black shirt and flag them down.\n\nAnswer:",

When I first moved here it was my go to place for just about everything. We were literally going 3 to 5 times a week. After awhile we noticed that the service was just starting to lack and the food was going a little down hill. \\n\\nWe went for a brunch once and whatever I got was horrible, and so was the service. Our server never even came back to check on us, and the bartender ended up being the one to give us our bill. I was pretty disappointed. The last 4 times we went I just felt it wasn't the same Jacks I fell in love with and bragged so much about. \\n\\nThey recently changed their menu and they basically took off everything that I  went there for!! I guess that explains why the stuff I got tasted pretty crappy the last few times I'd gone... maybe they were just fazing it out? I don't know but honestly I can say I will not jump for joy to go eat there again. The only thing they have left that I'd even get slightly excited about is the black bean quesadilla. :( \\n\\nNow Jacks will pretty much just be my place for a karaoke night out.

The bass noise is way to high for such a small venue. I also find it disrespectful to be playing that lowd until 11pm at night. I'm all for having fun, but not so loud and all day long. I went to the venue parking lot and felt like I was in the heart of a rave party and couldn't even have a normal conversation 300 yards away inside my car.  I hope this will not continue to happen.  Having a permit should not allow anyone to exceed a certain noise level- especially the bass noise level- regardless of who they are.  I have heard the symphony play there before and they are fine and I don't hear them inside my home- so that should be the benchmark you set. I am absolutely sure that I am not the only complaint in the area, and things like this should not be allowed to happen.\n\nAnswer:",

Their customer service was terrible. First, I arrived into my suite and did not realize that there was a sign on the fridge that mentions that we get charged if the beverages were removed. I removed it without knowing and put my own beverages into the fridge. Then I realized that I would have gotten charged I immediately called the front desk and they offered to send someone in to check the fridge to make sure that nothing was opened and to waive the fee if nothing was opened. The following day  I was still concerned on if anyone has shown up to see the refreshments and I called the front desk again to ask for someone to come up to check.  Also, there were many things broken in the room and a repair man came to help fix them so we could avoid and charges happening after our stay. My boyfriend was inside the hotel room all day and did not see anyone come to check our refreshments. We made another call and a person at front desk said that they will just waive the fee for us. We were not informed anything about refreshment \\\"restocking\\\" fee.  On Sunday morning we called for more blankets and pillows at 5:48am and still did not get them until I finally tired of waiting for them until 6:45am outside my room. I went down to the front desk and tried to get them myself and finally around 7am pillows and blankets were sent to our room. Finally, Sunday afternoon someone has come up to our hotel room to check the refreshments. This was a very misleading situation because we were informed that our refreshment fees got waived. We were really confused because we have been informed that it has been taken care of. I have talked to many front desks employees and managers that were informing us that the refreshment fees would be taken care off. I am really upset with the customer service that I have dealt with this past weekend. I left to come back home still feeling unsure about the refreshment situation and my bill. I called today to try to find out how much I was billed and the front desk did not want to help me and said that they would just email me my receipt and tried getting me off the phone not answering my question. Then I have called the Venetian again and spoke to a male front desk person and explaining him the situation about the refreshments and informing him that there were the repair man and the front desk person reassuring us that we would get our refreshments fees waived. He was very understanding about our situation, but wanted to run through the manager. At first the manager stated that I was informed many times about the $50 restocking refreshment fee, but that is totally false. They argued that they have it on their notes that I was informed. Then they tried to say that I stated that I had the drinks in the bathroom. I have meant that the drinks were my own beverages in the bathroom. I am very upset with the way Laurie/Lauren the manager that refused to waive the charged and hung up on me when I asked I wanted the person's name that made the note that was informed because I wanted to get them fired. What kind of service is this? I had to call back and ask for her again and tried to get compensation, but she insisted that she was not going to waive the fee and that was that. I am very upset with the Venetian and the way they handles their customers with their policy and their miscommunications. I want to request if there are any taped recordings of my phone calls with the front desk because the manager I had spoken with had claimed that I was notified on every conversation concerning this matter and claimed that I had made statements that allegedly admitted \\\"facts\\\" that I had never said and the contradictory reasoning that was used to deny our claim.  This experience has been a complete disappointment to me and my guests.  I have never been this upset to make a formal complaint, but based on this experience, I will be making sure that neither myself nor anyone that I know will ever be staying at this disgraceful hotel again.\n\nAnswer:",

I don't believe I've given 5-stars to an Italian restaurant since Yelping, until now! I can only hope that if you're in Phoenix, and you try any of their locations, your meal will be as great as our's.\\n\\nAnd for us, the revelation of why this meal was sooo good, went back to the source; fresh ingredients. And how do we know that Tutti Santi cooks with fresh ingredients, like fresh picked basil from their own garden? Because Nina, the 80 year \\\"young\\\" owner shared that, and a few other secrets with us, at our table.  \\n\\nIt might have been the comment that the gnocchi was absolutely as good as my wife's....... and THAT COMMENT was made in front of my wife! The word must've gone from our lips, to the server, to the kitchen......... to Nina herself! Because from then on, it was more than just a great Italian dinner experience. It was a great Italian dinner experience with \\\"Nina.\\\" She left the kitchen, and came to our table, sharing some cooking, and life, experiences, and also sharing how she comes into the restaurant as early as 4am, just to make their fresh pastas..... and that great gnocchi. I couldn't believe her energy and spunk! Waiter........ I'm having whatever Nina's having for breakfast!!!\\n\\nAnd yes, we started by ordering their \\\"famous gnocchi appetizer.\\\" You've got to order the gnocchi; either the appetizer or the entree! Enough said on that. We then followed with one of the specials; Penne pasta with chicken and Italian sausage in a pink sauce. It was DELICIOUS... and I could taste the very traditional Italian sausage, which was perfectly seasoned. And the chicken? It was white meat strips that had an incredibly fresh taste, and wonderful texture. Our other dish was their eggplant parm. And just how good was that? My wife commented that it melted in her mouth; the best version of eggplant parm she's ever had. And it came with a very generous serving of spaghetti pomadoro. The pomodoro is a basic red sauce, and in this case, a very \\\"Roma tomato\\\" fresh tasting sauce. And because I asked about their meat sauces, the waiter brought me a soup bowl filled with the Bolognese sauce, which I liberally put on both their garlic bread and some of my penne pasta.

It is the smaller American test venture of the British grocery giant Tesco, who I believe is the UK equivalent of Kroger.\\n\\nI routinely stop by here after work to pick up a few things before I head home to make dinner and the store is always clean, well stocked and everything is reasonably priced.  The employees I have met have all been very friendly and helpful.\\n\\nTheir house brand is quite high quality and I usually prefer them in both taste and pricing.  Also there are some harder to find items in their import section, which is nice if you occasionally indulge in dishes from overseas, particularly from the UK.  Where else in the Valley can you quickly find clotted cream, spotted dick (*giggle*) and Wheatabix cereal?  Of course the prices for the import items are slightly more than the regular domestic items, but that's to be expected.\\n\\nThey also have a reduced price, fresh food section which I really like because it's usually chock full of ready to eat, but on the verge of expiring, items that are both tasty and affordable.  Also, they sometimes distribute samples of the bakery items from the in-store bakery in the back.  I've noticed their baked goods are quite delicious.  Additionally, they have an admirable selection of import cheeses, cured meats, wines, fresh made hummus, salsas, olives, etc..  I think the perfect Summer dinner is a tray of sliced meats, cheeses, a fresh baguette, some buttery spread, olives, heirloom tomatoes, grapes, roasted nuts and maybe some fig jam.  Delicious and easy thanks to Fresh & Easy.\\n\\nThey send out a weekly mailer that always has a coupon of differing value on your overall purchase price, not just on an individual item.  I really like the $5 off of $25 coupons, but more often than not they send out the $3 off of $30 coupon, not a smoking deal, but if you are coming here anyway that week it pays to have the coupon with you and pocket the $3 savings, right??\\n\\nMy only complaint is about their convoluted, hot ass mess of a shopper's reward card program.  From what I can tell, it's more worthless than tits on a boar hog.  For that alone I am subtracting a point.  It has some bizarre equation of points accumulated with certain purchases.  (But not all purchases...?  I'm actually not sure, it's THAT confusing)  Those points are somehow linked back to some coupons you've *maybe* earned somewhere, which I have never seen offered nor have I been able to generate *any* point-of-sale reduction in price either, and I shop here quite frequently...  It doesn't make any sense, I suspect it's simply a marketing ploy to track our spending habits with the constantly moving target of the tantalizing promise of potential savings, someday...  I MUCH prefer shoppers rewards cards that give you an instant discount (on a artificially inflated price, naturally) or even better, NO rewards cards at all, just plain, old low prices.  Now THAT'S a novel concept.  ;)\\n  \\nAnyway, aside from the stupid shoppers card, all in all, because of its manageable size and fresh selection, this is a good store for a quick trip in and out.  If I need a huge cart full of groceries, this isn't the best store since their overall selection is smaller than say a Fry's, but still for a few must-have dinner or lunch items this is a great option.  And yes, aside from some kinks when they first opened with regards to rotating stock they really are Fresh & Easy.\n\nAnswer:",

I was greeted in a very unusual way; I was told they could seat me at the bar if I left at exactly 6 o'clock (I walked in right when they opened at 5).  I worked in the service industry for over 2 years and I have never told a guest that they can eat if they leave in an hour.  It's sort of a ridiculous request; as a customer, you can't control how long it takes for your food to come up.  It's also not very welcoming; then again it was their anniversary, I had no reservation and they were squeezing me in.  I think the better way to have handled it would have been to put no deadline on my dinner and quietly tell the kitchen to rush any order I put in. Regardless, I was seated and my server was very sweet and I felt right at home. I ordered the piece of cheese, fruit, and grilled nut bread for an appetizer. I was brought an excellent slice of brie, perfect plums and a spicy fruit spread.  The bread was burned though. Not necessarily worth $9, but still okay. For my salad course I ordered the bloomsdale spinach, sungold tomatoes, pinenuts and goat ricotta. Oh my God!  Amazing. The bloomsdale spinach is this leafy green, similar in appearance and texture to kale without the nasty taste. Because it wasn't limp, the dressing didn't wilt the leaves and the contrast in texture with the pinenuts and ricotta goat cheese was superb. I was really impressed they didn't go with the usual feta. It was susggested I order the pasta, chanterelles (type of mushroom), bacon, tarragon, asiago, butternut squash and creme fraiche dish. I ordered it without bacon and it arrived with bacon.  No big deal, except no one checked on whether I was enjoying the dish; I had to flag someone down, which was a challenge and took 10 minutes.  Normally this would not have been a big deal, but I was on a deadline and only had 20 minutes left. When the new dish of pasta arrived it was so overwhelmed with asiago, I couldn't discern between the mushrooms and squash--all I tasted was cheese and creme fraiche. Also, at $21 for a modest portion, it was slightly overpriced (although I realize the ingredients are seasonal and exceptional quality).  If you do decide to order that dish, I recommend asking for no cheese; the creme fraiche was enough. My server asked if I would like dessert and I said I couldn't--it was 6. He told me he could move me to another table and I could have my dessert there.  It seemed like a lot of hassle and I just wanted to take my leftovers home and enjoy them without rushing, so I declined.  He brought me my check and a yummy minature cookie and I was on my way. Overall, I think the menu is thoughtful but overpriced.  If you are a foodie, I strongly recommend going for the experience but making a reservation first. Bon Appetit!\n\nAnswer:",

Hey Management, here's a few pointers for you:\\n\\nWhen there are events downtown, people WILL show up.  Stop looking so shocked.  We are actually there because the wait everywhere else is too long, and we were forced to look to you by default.  Restaurant staffing is variable, meaning you are allowed to schedule adequate staff for an event night.\\n\\nWe rolled in, took a look around, checked out the menu and rolled out.  Then we found out the wait at Cooperstown, which was wall to wall with people, was an hour.  So we rolled back to Jacksons.  The wait for food, when the place was at only 1/3 of their capacity was an hour.  For food.  For bar food.  They have 8 items on the menu, most of which are fried.  Has it ever occurred to their staff to, umm, I unno, PREPARE?  We found an outside seat, and I meandered up to the outside bar.  15 minutes later, I finally got served.  I kept my mouth shut, because I watched one of the bartenders berate a woman for complaining about the wait.  Granted, she was a bitch, but a bitch with a  valid point.  They were only serving the people at the ends of the bar, completely ignoring the 30 or so SITTING in the middle.  \\n\\n$12 for 2 vodka Red Bulls, a fair price.  After learning about the wait, we decided to forgo food, but there was another 15 minute wait when I went back to the cash only outside bar.  So much for them remembering decent tippers.  \\n\\nThe seating arrangement outside seems weird, awkward and unbalanced, and it only gets worse when you head inside.  I hear they have \\\"servers\\\" but since I only saw one looking harried inside, that could be more of an urban legend than fact.  They could easily add more tables inside and rearrange the outside to seat more people comfortably, but given that they can't handle a preconcert crowd, they shouldn't unless they hire some experienced, friendly staff.\\n\\nI won't be going back anytime soon.\n\nAnswer:",

At 15 dollars for range fee it's 5 dollars cheaper than most places around the strip. They offer discounts to locals and ladies on different days of the week.

If you are debating on purchasing a firearm they also offer rentals so you may test it out before purchasing.  Rifle range goes to a max of 50 yards.

Definitely will have a good time here!\\n\\nHowever the store and gear they sell is pretty pricey. You'll be well off buying online and transferring to an ffl of your choice.

I rent a car each time but this was my first experience with Dollar and will probably be my last.  Yes, they came in the low end with the rates but still I was under the impression most rental cars were 'new'.   The car I had was 2 years old and the filthiest rental car, I've ever had.  The seats and steering wheels were sticky with soda spills.  The car also had a strange odor.  But worse, a couple of times along my trip the car sputtered but seemed to run ok.  I told the guy when I turned the car in about the sputtering but he seemed unconcerned.  The rental wound up costing twice the price quoted due to all the added fees and a mandatory insurance but that seems to be the case no matter what rental agency I use.\n\nAnswer:",

Food was just average. However the reason for my 1star review-   On my way out i ordered a piece of chocolate cream pie to take out.   When I got home I opened the box and inside was a dried up piece of pie.   Literally.  I put my fork into the whipped cream and the entire whipped cream came off in one piece.  Underneath the chocolate was dried and cracked.  It was the consistency  of something that sat for 2 weeks in an arid place.   Im not making this up.  The pie had to have been a couple of weeks old.  What bothered me though was that waitress HAD to have known the pie was old.  The staff HAD to have passed it several times over the weeks.  I was floored.  I threw it out cause it was too late to drive back there.  Da did they think I wouldn't notice!  Will never go back there because that wasn't just a mistake.

For $3 you can jump on any bus (heads up they don't give change) or metro (they do) and get to most places on the island. Most of the core metro stops were originally built right before Expo 67 - in other words, a bunch of urban planners and artists spent a bunch of money to make beautiful transit that would help showcase Montreal to the world. Each original station featured a different Quebecois artist, so sometimes you'll pop out of the metro below giant stained glass, or come up the stairs to face an enormous sculpted tree. The Mtl subway system is the most used system in Canada, the city has been coordinating forms of public transit since 1861 and you do get the feeling that, though not perfect, it's something Mtl takes seriously and tries to do right. \\n\\nThe subway and buses are very clean and even kind of chic compared to Toronto or NYC's, and the system is simple to navigate: eg unlike other city's subways you won't have different trains running the same track, stopping at the exact same spot requiring you to read a sign on the train itself to make sure you've got the right one. In Montreal if you stand on the right platform, you're getting on the right train. \\n\\nThe monthly pass is called the Opus card, it costs about $70 a month for unlimited rides if you're an adult, but you can also just buy 10 or 20 rides at a time on your Opus card and they won't expire at the end of the month - a sweet cheap option for a commuter like me who doesn't need to use transit every day. When you swipe your Opus card at the metro turnstile it shows you how many rides you have left so you know when to refill. It doesn't have a photo on it, but you can register your Opus card number at Berri, Jean Talon, Snowdon, or Lionel to protect you in case of loss or theft. \\n\\nIf you're a visitor you can check out the 1 day or 1 week rates, but these have set start and end days and times that I find confusing personally. When folks visit me we just buy the $20 pack of 10 tickets - these can be used on the bus or metro, they include transfers, and they don't expire for a year (or more?) so whatever my guests don't use doesn't go to waste. \\n\\nWhen using these tickets on the metro just slide the ticket into the slot as indicated, wait for it to pop back up, then remove it and push through the turnstile.\\n\\nThe metro stops downtown - eg McGill, Peel - connect to the underground malls, so you can shop and wander indoors for miles in the winter. Calling this an underground city is overselling it, but for mall basements connected by tunnels and metros it's arright.\\n\\nThe metros generally stop running around 1am, except during nuit blanche when they run all night. There are useful night buses that run most of the major arteries, and the lineup for these at 3am is jovial, boozy and ridiculous (the one to Montreal West and the West Island leaves from Atwater). \\n\\nIn general I've had great experiences with the drivers and staff at the metros and on the buses - special shoutout to the singing driver who is beloved on every route he drives. The staff are mostly but not always bilingual, but anyway all the automated tellers have an English option. There is confusion every time they change the system, but that's to be expected and doesn't happen too often. There was a brief period when STM bus drivers all seemed like jerks because they would drive away from passengers trying to cross the street or running up at the last second to catch the bus, but someone seems to have changed their mind about this jerkiness being a good idea and now they act like kind-hearted humans again, waiting that extra second for little old ladies trying to catch the bus, and things are much better.\n\nAnswer:",

I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.\\n\\nI find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade.\n\nAnswer:",

This was even after loosing 10 pounds after I bought the wedding gown.  This ended up costing me a little more money in the alterations department then I hadn't planned on spending.  My bridesmaids also ordered their dresses  from Alfred Angelo as well (I got a discount on the bridesmaids dresses for buying my gown there- $25 off of each dress)  My sister who is a size 0, and 100 pounds ordered a size 2 and the dress wouldn't zip up when she tried it on- drama.

Why $50? because that's how much my automatic SB gold card reload is worth every month.  \\n\\nI grew up in the PNW, mostly in the Seattle area where Starbucks was born, and where locals, ironically and deliberately avoid Starbucks and patronize other local and smaller coffee shops, where my friends and I frequented Vivace Coffee on Broadway in Capitol Hill.  I didn't turn to Starbucks until after I left the US and was stationed overseas.  It was one of those things I did whenever I felt homesick and wanted to touch base with the motherland and felt the need to re-enforce my being an American. Then, it grew on me. My drink of choice:   (Summer/Spring) Venti Iced Mocha, light whip or (Fall/Winter) Extra Hot Venti Mocha, no whip.  \\n\\nMy all time favorite Starbucks has to be the one in Rhodes, Decadence, Greece (my review will be forthcoming).  My least favorite has to be this 24/7 Starbucks with drive Thur.\\n\\nStarbucks is Starbucks wherever you go. You'll get the very same mediocre pricey coffee drink they're famous for, but the only way one sets apart from the other is the degree of customer service, the ambience and the way the general interior areas conducive to enjoying a cup of joe.  As expected in any Starbucks, you will get the customary greetings albeit superficial.  The staff is trained and programmed to say and do that accompanied by their banal smiles and trite perkiness.  Once your order is rung,  you're nothing but a tall, grande or a venti cup of coffee :).  I've spent numerous hours here almost on a daily basis.  I've  come to know some of the regulars and have become oblivious to everything not so good about this place. I have to admit, however,  that sometimes it does get under my skin.  It's like going to a reputable Chinese restaurant where you know and what you only care about is the excellent food, and will keep on coming back despite the fact (and you being fully aware) that \\\"good customer service\\\" is something that is not and will never be on the menu.  The only difference is that I come here not for their excellent drinks but because  of its proximity to where I live (accessibility) and it being open 24/7 (convenience).\\n\\nThis Starbucks is, most often than not, packed with students during school seasons btwn noon and midnight (especially towards the evening) who are studying (?) hours on end.  Some with just an order of one drink and multiple free refills of iced water, some bringing with them lunch bags, dinner boxes, veggies in Ziploc bags, bottles of soda pop, munchies and snacks in small plastic containers, or food ordered from nearby restaurants (pizza, rice bowls, wraps), and thermos bottles.  I've seen some bring their blankets, extra sweatshirts, and some even show up in their PJ's.   The campers are pretty much the same faces and same group of students just about every day!. Good luck if you're thinking about coming here during midterms or final exams. This Starbucks is the unofficial library/group study room of the various Las Vegas academes.  \\n\\nBusier than your typical Starbucks, this location's staff (or understaff) gets so busy(overworked), to the point of being overwhelmed, that their bathrooms are hardly checked and cleaned.  And since there are always cramming students camping in, the actual lounge is hardly kept cleaned and kept in order.  More often than not, you'll have to ask and remind the staff that they're out of  tissue paper in the bathroom, or out of napkins, milk or sugar.  I can only assume that they do all their organizing and cleaning up when the flow of customers slows down (during wee hours).  I also noticed how fast their staff turnover is.  It seems like they have new baristas/staff every other month or so (unless they rotate their shifts).  Their wi-fi connection's reliability is mediocre at best. There was even a time when it was literally down for over a month.  The staff knew about it but there were no signs saying that they were having wifi issues, and if you asked the staff,  their response was : \\\"Yeah, we know!\\\".  (it was during those times when I didn't see any campers, and the tables and chairs were for the taking).    \\n\\nDon't get me wrong.  You'll get your drink alright but you have to pay special attention (or literally stand by the pick up counter) or you will never know that your name/order has been called and your drink has been sitting on the counter!  Had they ever gotten my drink wrong?  Yes, on more than one occasion.  Sometimes it didn't bother me and didn't ask for a replacement and sometimes I did (contingent upon my mood, or how busy the barista was).  Besides, the staff can be genuinely friendly and chatty, when not busy.  \\n\\nThis may be my least favorite Starbucks and yet it's the one place I always choose to go to and go back to.......over and over again.\n\nAnswer:",

Just moved to the area and was the first time I tryed this cleaner, had a coupon stating $1.89 per shirt.  When I came to pick up the shirts (33) shirts I was charged NOT the coupon price of 1.89 but $2.30 a shirt when I asked about the price I was told that the extra charge was for extra large shirts.  When I said I have never been charge for the size of the shits, he was rude and very short with me.  After taking the shirts out to my car I came back in and asked for the name of the owner since I was going to file a complaint.  He said he was the owner and handed me his business card and walked away.  What a way to treat a new customer, very rude, very rude.  As others have said in the reviews for this cleaner, go somewhere else this is a very rude uncoporative and untruthful company that has no sign anywhere in the store that states additional cost for larger sizes.  Nor was I told the coupon price was not good on my shirts when I brought them in to be cleaned.  The attorney general should check into this business and their business practices.\n\nAnswer:",

There are 3 in NYC, 3 in Houston, and one each in Taipei, New Orleans and this one in Phoenix. \\n\\nIt is old and grungy, and hard to get to with the light rail construction. The prices are dirt cheap, the decor is dirt cheap and the food is un-remarkable. They offer most of the usual Vietnamese dishes, from Goi Cuon appetizers (summer rolls) to Bun (vermicelli), Mi (egg noodles), Com (rice plates) to stir fry chicken, pork, beef; also seafood, some specials and Pho soups (16 different ones).\\n\\nThe Pho comes in 2 sizes, with most regulars costing only $3.95, and the large costing $4.50. Their large is equivalent to many places' medium, however. The broth is average at best, and all the accroutements are too. \\n\\nI am not sure how the franchise works (royalties, menus, common logo, etc) but if you want a very cheap meal and you are not a snob or afficianado of Vietnamese food, this places works for a quick filler.

I started a new diet and exercise routine and my eating has to be pretty strict in the beginning. I'm taking a meal replacement to get the protein I need and eating high protein, low carb meals designed by my nutritionist. I was running out of my meal replacement which is a hard to find one because it's all natural, high protein, low carb, tastes great and no artificial flavors. \\n\\nAlso it has superior quality protein. So anyway, let me preface this by saying I HATE chocolate anything. Hate is probably even an understatement. I just cannot eat or drink anything chocolate flavored. So I always order vanilla meal replacement. Well I opened my shipment from Vitacost yesterday and what was in the box instead of the vanilla that I ordered? You guessed it.....chocolate. I gag. I gag. I called and they sent a replacement so I'm awaiting the correct flavor. \\n\\nI order all of the time and this was the first time I received an incorrect order. The customer service agent was very helpful. Now I will just wait for the right flavor to arrive. The prices are really great, much better than Vitamin Shoppe. Vitamin who? Right!

It's a cool little spot around 12th st and Oak, in the middle of a neighborhood. The decor is very modern, but warm and inviting. We opted to get an appetizer and a few of the small plates rather than the larger plates they had. They had a balanced but approachable wine list, I had an awesome Tempranillo for under 10 bucks a glass!  We opted for the crispy shrimp and okra for the appetizer, which came with this spicy banana sauce and this cool yogurt sauce.  I really really liked this dish, the okra was great and the shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked. Not sure about the banana sauce, but overall a great dish. We then decided to get the stuffed dates with crispy Schreiner's Chorizo and Manchego. It came with dressed spinach, prob one of my fave dishes in Phoenix right now!  We also ordered the macaroni and cheese and I forgot to mention the toasted bread and roasted garlic we ordered. The bread and garlic was just okay, nothing special.  I, surprisingly, was not a fan of the mac and cheese either, it seemed very grainy (I know it was chock full of parmesan so that's probably what it was, but it was just unappealing to me). Overall this place has potential. I'll definitely go back, especially because we got out with 3 glasses of wine and 4 small dishes with tax and tip for under $70.00!!\n\nAnswer:",

Go West on Tropicana and you're there in about 15 minutes.\\n\\nThe beauty is in the details at Capo's. When you arrive, you walk into a small vestibule. Soon, a small window slides open and a slightly frightening italian man asks what you want. If you manage to convince him you deserve entrance (don't worry- you will), he disappears, only to reappear shortly thereafter to open the door wide, allowing you into the dimly lit restaurant. The chairs and booths are comfortable. The music is fun and often sung by a guy trying for all his might to be Sinatra. Old ganster movies such as the OG Ocean's 11 are playing on a large flatscreen above the bar. The walls are decorated with pictures of infamous mobsters and the boothes are all red velvet and leather.\\n\\nThe food. My. God. The. Food. Take a lactaide before you get there- these people are serious about cheese. And garlic. This is everything you love but know you shouldn't about Italian cusine. I highly recommend the bruschetta (a beautiful harmony of tomatoes, onion and pesto with a bit of a kick) and \\\"The Chef Sleeps with da Fishes\\\" (an alfredo dish with at least a dozen large, tender shirmp swimming in creamy cheesey goodness). \\n\\nThis is a great place for groups and families. We had a party of 25 including 5 children and 4 teenagers. Everyone LOVED both the food and the ambiance. There was another large group of about 20 and we had absolutely NO problem with service. Everyone was very attentive with the doorman, waiter, busboy and party planner all coming by to make sure everyone was taken care of. \\n\\nThe skinny:\\nCredit cards are accepted.\\nEntrees range from $10.50 for spaghetti w/ meatballs to $25 for specialty dishes\\nSeveral desserts are available for about $7 each\\nFull bar and good wine selection available\\nReservations are HIGHLY recommended as the place is not big\\n\\n**Important note: If you have a group of 15 or more you will have to have a set menu, where everyone pays the same price, starting at about $35 p/p.

I went on a date here and we were going to order a couple things off the menu, but the manager said, \\\"Let me take care of you- you're going to love this\\\". We looked at each other (date and I) and were like, \\\"Ok, I guess\\\".\\n\\nThe manager sent out a garlic plate. It wasn't the worst thing for a date, since roasted garlic isn't stinky, but it was a cheesy heavy gross mess for me. I'm not into that kind of food at all and would have much preferred to choose something different. It was huge as well, we couldn't even finish it and didn't have any room to try any entrees on the menu. \\n\\nSo, well, next time I know better and will stick to my own palate preferences rather than be persuaded by  a stranger that thinks first date food should be the size and style of a fancy superbowl platter. The dish wasn't gross, but it was incredibly heavy for 2 people. i might order that as an app if I was with a party of 4 or larger.\\n\\nOverall, the place is beautiful and it's a great date spot.

I've seen more Little Caesars here than I have in any other city that I've been to and trust me I've been to a lot.  Anyhow, I digress back to Crave.  Every since being first introduced to hookahs in 2006 in Ft. Lauderdale by some co-workers I've enjoyed partaking in the experience on occasion.  Most hookah bars that I've been to in the past have seemed pretty authentic.  They've been decked out in Middle Eastern decor, seats are on the floor on pillows and belly dancers perform live.   When going with large parties, reservations have been required but a dress code never was.  \\n\\nSo, one night I had a friend in town and I called up another friend and we decided to go to Crave.  I had checked out the website and noticed it was a bit more upscale than the hookah bars I had been to before but still decided to give it a try.  Upon arriving there was no host or hostess at the door so we had to wait for about 5 minutes.  We were then asked if we had a reservation, which we did, and were seated only after the hostess disappeared for another 5 minutes or so.  \\n\\nMy friends and I sat down and waited at least 15 minutes before our server came over.  At this point we were all pretty agitated but our server was extremely nice so she enticed us to stay.  We ordered drinks, our hookah and some entrees.  The drinks came first and they were delicious!!! The hookah came next and it was so strong that it could've grown hair on your chest, as my parents would say.  Then our food came which was just as tasty as our drinks (I had the crab and lobster bisque, it was to live for).  When it was time for us to pay our server asked how we wanted the bill to come and naturally we asked for it to be split.  She said they don't do that.  It could only be split evenly.  That sucked because I hadn't ordered as much as my friends had.  \\n\\nI wouldn't necessarily suggest going back but if one of my friends wanted to go I'd tag along.\n\nAnswer:",

First of all, we love the Tuna Sashimi, has always been very fresh and very good.  We also get the spicy tuna roll, crunch munch roll, edamame and sometimes gyoza.  The food is why we have always gone back..We have never been disappointed with that aspect.  \\n\\nThe service however, has always missed the mark.  From rude or uninterested hostess/greeters to ever changing food servers to inappropriately dressed female bartenders.  We ALWAYS sit at the round tables in the \\\"bar area\\\", we may or may not get waited on before asking for service.  It seems that if you see a server, but you are not in their section, you don't get served...very disappointing that a server can see you have been there for a good 5 minutes and no one has helped you and they don't even stop to see if they can get you anything.  Another aspect that is irritating is the fact that we do frequent the place, at least once a week and never any type of recognition that they even know who we are.\\n\\nAll of that being said, and why I have now rated them at 3 stars...Last night (Saturday) we had an absolutely awesome experience!  They have a new Sushi Chef and it is very apparent based on the rolls and sashimi, as I said, we always liked the food but last night it was exceptional.  We like what they are doing with the decor, looks more like a restaurant than a sports bar, although they still need to do something with the cafeteria style look to the center of the restaurant tables...not inviting at all. \\n\\nNow for our service...our server was Ali, for the first time ever...He recognized us as regular customers, greeted us with a friendly demeanor and even remembered what we had to drink on previous occasions.  He got our order perfect, made sure everything was great, kept up with our drinks, etc without being obtrusive or overbearing.  He even made sure the manager Po, came over and introduced himself and chatted with us about the changes being made...this made for very personal service and an enjoyable evening.\\n\\nI am only giving 3 stars, although last night deserved 5 stars, because I want to make sure they keep up with that level of service and that things are really changing around there for the better.

The restaurant is lovely, and prices are reasonable for this quality of restaurant (table linens, a good wine  list, appropriate stemware for quality wines, etc). This is not a jeans and t-shirt place. Understand that this is ethnic dining at its best, and the proprietor will be personally involved in your experience. He will visit your table often. He explains menu items and preparations in detail, so don't be afraid to ask.\\n\\nOthers have complimented  the oven bread that comes out first with a little bowl of shirazi (marinated chopped cucumber,tomato and onion ), but the eggplant appetizer (borani) was truly outstanding. My husband who, is more familiar with Persian cuisine, selected  a well-known dish after his eggplant, the  chelo kabab koobideh (ground beef filet, char broiled tomato and rice) plate, and he was very pleased. Yogurt on the side  completed the flavors of the dish. We asked Mr. Habib to describe the special meals he offers in addition to the shish kabob plates. These Persian specialties are not pictured on the menu supplement, but be sure to ask about them if you are interested in a dining adventure.  The chicken with bayberry pilaf was especially good. I was happy with my chicken in pomegranate and walnut sauce, a dark savory stew which is served over pilaf.   One of our party was unhappy with her choice and Mr. Habib quickly and graciously replaced it. He wanted us to be satisfied. We truly felt like a guest in his home. We kept a little tummy space for dessert to end a perfect meal, sharing  an order of baklava and a flan which the waiter torched table-side to caramelize the sugar crust.\\nWe will be back.\n\nAnswer:",

But it's darn tasty... flank steak assertively marinated and grilled, with a nice char on the outside.  The char sets good carne asada apart from the rest.  Loved the agua fresca offerings.... I got the jamaica and dining partner ordered tamarindo.  both tangy and refreshing.  however we take major points off for the chips/salsa.  it's a side dish for $1.50, with a fairly good sized basket of chips but a tiny little dribble of salsa.  we got more for another $1.50 and still felt ripped off.  I mean c'mon, kids, you can make gallons of the stuff for a small amount of dinero, you're shamelessly overcharging for it.  We will probably go back to try the Vampiro and the Pastor, but I'd gladly give more than 3 stars if you weren't so parsimonious with salsa, a Mexican restaurant staple.\n\nAnswer:",

The reviews for this place and Tamba were nice, but wanted to find some place off the strip and with easy parking so picked Mint.\\n\\nThe place looks little shady from outside, the plaza was dark and the restaurant did not seem very brightly lit from outside. But don't worry it's a great place from inside. The decor is nice and upscale. It's a quite place, with comfortable seating. The lights could be brighter. There were few other table's occupied (All by Indians) - A good sight if you are looking for true Indian spicy food and not tamed down for the American population. \\n\\nThe waiter was nice, pleasant and took out his iPhone while talking to us. Realized within minutes he was noting down our order with an app from the app store. Also said they own a software company and are going to start using their own app in some time.\\n\\nComing to the main part! FOOD! It was really good. \\nWe ordered Mint Lassi and Masala Chhas. Both were very Indian and really tasty. \\nTheir Menu is very well organized. Great for Vegetarians and Vegans since each item says if its good for vegetarians or vegans. Very happy to see how they describe each item in the menu really well. One of the best organized Menu's among all restaurants (Comparing to all Indian, American etc. restaurants).\\n\\nFor the main course we ordered Paneer Makhani, Daal Makhani and Chole With Naans. Everything was really good. Daal Was very tasty, although the color might make you think its not the best, but trust me the taste is nothing short of what you find back home. Naan's were also very good. \\n\\nThey also have Nepalese  food but did not try it, but would love to try that too. \\nOverall great place if you are looking for true Indian Food. Would definitely go back again.\n\nAnswer:",

The goat cheese salad featured some tasty onions and tart goat cheese, but the dressing was lacking in flavor and it definitely didn't live up to the expectation that several \\\"yelpers\\\" had set.  The salmon entree was spot-on, and the relish topping popped with incredible flavor.

The Breakfast Club?  OR Daily Dose?  This is what my husband and I pondered early Sunday morning as we planned to meet another couple for brunch.  After reading numerous Yelp reviews and a few other sites, Daily Dose was the decision!  \\nThe four of us were seated outside at a raised table.  Nice!  Inside seemed really claustrophobic and dark, so to be outside was great.  Our waitress was slow to arrive, but time passed easily as we were caught up in conversation.  I had read that Daily Dose had the BEST Bloody Marys in town.  So we all ordered one.  I love celery in mine, but I guess they do not garnish with celery, but the waitress said she would do it if I wanted.  We all ordered them spicy too.  We couldn't wait!!!!!!!  But we DID wait........and wait.......and wait......and wait, well you get my drift.  They finally came!  With a green onion as a garnish!?!  OK, Celery?  Oh, it WAS in there, just a tiny short piece that was halfway down the glass.  Well, she did have it in there.  \\nThe menu item choices were impressive!  They looked so creative!  I was excited to order! We ordered the breakfast nachos, which everyone on Yelp raved about!  We also ordered the eggs benedict with prime rib and the Southwest Flannel Hash.  And then we waited, and waited and waited......\\nEVERYONE on the patio had no food.  NONE!  I love looking at what other people have ordered, but not one person on the \\\"packed\\\" patio had food.  Not in any stage- just starting, just finishing, in the middle, nothing.  Many did not have anything but water.  I couldn't believe how long the service took.    FINALLY, our food came with no apology of how long it took.  My husband and I shared our order of nachos and prime rib eggs benedict.  The eggs benedict looked good, but when I cut into it, it was a snotty, white mess of undercooked egg white.  In my experience, the only runny part should be the yoke, right?  Well, although I would have preferred the white to have been cooked, my husband and I ate it anyway.  The prime rib was virtually nonexistent.  The breakfast nachos were a HUGE disappointment.  The chorizo was more like flavorless ground meat.  No zing or heat.  The scrambled eggs on it were dry, overcooked, and tasted of sulfur - which is what happens to scrambled eggs when they are over cooked.  There was supposed to be mozzarella cheese on them.  Where?   I don't know, but the nachos were covered in a gluey sauce that I assume was supposed to be a nacho cheese of some sort?  There was also a cup of the gluey sauce on the side.  I guess they felt we needed more? The chips were so greasy, most were translucent.  We didn't eat most of it, just tried to pick and find the edible parts.  By that time we were so hungry and who knows where our 18 year old waitress was to make a complaint anyway.  My friend's Southwest Flannel Hash, which she let me sample, were the WORST I ever had.  I mean how can you mess up corned beef hash?  There was a weird sweet component to it.  She did not finish it, which is odd because she loves corned beef hash and always finishes it.  Her Husband had the prime rib eggs benedict like I did.  He is in the restaurant industry and manages a very popular resort restaurant and he was not happy with his meal at all.  Especially the prime rib part.  I was with him on that one.  To wrap up our  two and  1/2 hour brunch  experience (yes it took that long from start to finish due to slow service) Daily Dose was flat bland, busy and overpriced.   Sorry brother and sister Yelpers, I am in disagreement on this one.\n\nAnswer:",

City Athletic club is by far the dirtiest most unhealthy gym I've EVER been in. Where should I start? Ive NEVER seen anyone wiping down the equipment. To my knowledge the employees DO NOT sanitize the equipment. there is always something out of order , whether its the water fountains which are made for 2 feet tall people or the steam room which they finally put a sign up saying it will be reopened on 4-24 after who knows how long its been broken. The small cardio area is gross and doesn't have the nice built in tvs that EVERY other gym in town has now!! For all they charge for membership you would think they could get the best equipment. No wifi is just another disappoint in the long list of shortcomings at City Athletic Club. The mens locker room is really gross, and just 1 little bench in the regular locker room.

When it arrived, the both said it was a little undercooked. When we cracked a rigaton in half there was the white circle inside. From what I've always been taught and the internet has confirmed that means it's ALMOST done, but not quite. 1 more minute!

The clothes were definitely cute and trendy! I love how when you walk in, I was immediately greeted, and all the clothes were arranged by color and coordinating pants/shorts/skirts.  A lot of the items were pretty inexpensively priced.  Not too bad at all and very comparable to Forever21, Papaya, and Charlotte Russe stores.  \\n\\nThe layout of the store is pretty organized and the space is huge.  It was pretty easy to navigate through quickly and within 20 minutes, I had all my options in hand.  I was looking for some high-waisted black shorts though, which should be pretty standard in a shop like this, but there were only one pair to be found in the store and there wasn't really any staff walking around, nor anyone who was really helpful.  This made me forgo the decision of even bothering to try anything on, so I just went to check out.  At the front, they have their big jewelry selection color-coded as well, but all I saw were mainly necklaces, which looked cute and trendy, but looked very cheap and could easily fall apart.  Their shoe selection was also in the back corner of the store which was organized pretty well, but the selection wasn't anything to be wow-ed about.  Prices were fair... saw a cute pair of heels for under $30.  \\n\\nOverall, if you're looking for something cute in a quick-minute, this is a decent spot.  The clothing selection did have some unique items which you wouldn't find in other stores, but I think I would have rather gone to Forever21 instead as the quality of clothing is just a tiny bit better than the items here and cost-wise, you end up paying the same.

I fell in love with Howl @ the Moon in San Antonio Texas, so whenever I have an opportunity to visit Howl at the Moon in another city, I have to do it.     The musicians are great, and they make it alot of fun.   Don't know the words to the songs to sing along -- who cares, make something up!   The drinks are a little pricey, but they do have drink specials so it does not have to be a high dollar night.    I will warn you that if you get easily offended or not wanting to sing, have fun and laugh -- I would say skip the piano bar completely.  These entertainers and the patrons like to get loud, sing, dance and let loose and that is exactly why I keep coming back.     I cannot wait to visit Charlotte again in July!\n\nAnswer:",

On one hand, the words that other people have used to imply the vibe of the place are fair. It really is all of those things; assuming, euphuistic, grandiose, inflated, magniloquent, pompous, showy,  and sometimes downright snobbish (thank you thesaurus.com). It's in Scottsdale. People dress up to go here. Coyotes are always on the prowl. That being said, they have $7.00 sandwiches, people in khaki shorts and t-shirts sitting on plastic chairs outside in the 70 degree Phoenix winters, and mediocre service (sometimes downright slow). So, I still can't quite get my head wrapped around this place. One thing I did learn is to avoid the cocktail menu unless you're an American Express Red member. One night a friend and I ordered a martini each and our bill came to $25. With tip almost $30. Thanks but no thanks. So, this place is the yin and the yang, the best of times and the worst of times, the id and the superego. I think that you almost have to go once just to decide if you love it or hate it.\n\nAnswer:",

During the week its only $2 and $1 on Tuesdays.  Located behind the Krispy Kreme in Matthews (just look for the 'Hot' sign), the place looks like Pee Wee Herman's playhouse on the inside.  But I can forgive that.  \\n\\nThey show movies generally two months after their original release date.  Its your typical movie-fare, but   occasionally they throw in an indie or foreign film.  Look for the CineArts logo on the Showtimes page of the website. \\n\\nPlease be forewarned however: the concession stand is NOT discount price.  A large popcorn and drink runs $9.  Also, if you're going on a Fri or Sat., there will be a lot of teens.  They have cracked down on teen loitering in recent years, but certain teen-friendly movies might not be fun to watch on the weekend.

Nothing. As a third generation \\\"semi-native\\\" of Arizona and part Mexican myself, I can say without reservation that the food here is plentiful for all the big eaters out  there but as far as authentic or even flavorful, I would not waste my time. The Taco shells are similar to store bought Ortegas and the beans are no better than canned. All entrees are served in the traditional \\\"Americanized\\\" idea of a Mexican meal. That is to say that everything on the plate runs together and looks like somebody got sick on your plate.\\n\\nSorry. The only thing that was good here was the wait staff. Very attentive and gracious. One of the things I look for in a Mexican restaurant that gives me a pretty good idea that the food is decent is by how many actual Mexicans are eating there.

I was extremely disappointed when I moved into my apartment. Building 1501 #4 is not what the model apartment advertises. The wood laminate is different and ugly, there is carpet in the hallway and something is wrong with the flooring in the hallway as well(I think the carpet is kept to cover something up). I think the a/c unit is at least 30 years old and you will pay for it if you live in those apartments. You will also be sweating while your thermostat says its set at 74 degrees. So in the summer time, my down sizing cost was a wash. Also to mention that anytime I would go into the office, Kevin would talk to me about partying and people crashing at his house because they were to drunk to drive all the way home from his house in Maricopa. (I have been sober for along time and found this extremely unprofessional). Last but not least upon my move out date, I ended up in the ER extremely ill. I tried to contact the office 8 times with one voicemail on my move out date to let them know that I was in the hospital. No one answered and no one called me back until the next day. It was Calvin the maintenence man. I told him what had happened and that I tried to call several times. His response was \\\"well you are probably going to have to pay for another day since you still have some stuff in the apartment.\\\" The maintenance man was telling me that I needed to pay more after being hospitalized!!!!! I told him \\\"no\\\", I won't be\\\" and that I will call back later when I was more lucid. So I tried to call 6 more times that day and no one answered. I showed up to the apartment in the evening time and got the 3 boxes and vacuum cleaner out of the apartment and went to drop off my keys. The new manager(who I believe was a poor decision in bringing on), was just sitting at her desk. The office was super quiet and her attitude was like I owed her something because her maintenance guy wasn't charging me for another day.........these experiences left a bad taste in my mouth and I am so grateful I do not live there anymore!!! Beware of the level of class you are getting at these apartments...you get what you pay for!!!\n\nAnswer:",

No problems, however they informed me that her water pump had a leak.  It did, and after the leaky part was replaced the next day on Wednesday September 10th, and showed to me, I was satisfied with the work, and paid the $727.00.  However, within 25-30 miles of driving, the coolant began leaking severely, by mid-day, Thursday September 11th.  Alarmed with the timing, since my wife takes impeccable care of her car, and since the coolant had never leaked before, and since the container where the coolant gets poured, was less than one year old and installed by a dealership, I took the car right back to the repair center within 10 minutes of my wife telling me there was now a coolant leak.  I was told by the manager at the Purrfect facility that it is possible to put too much coolant in this car, and that was the problem, and they just needed to remove some.  This was after the leak had started, and this explanation was given to me after four of these guys put the car up on the rack and looked at it with flashlights, with their faces 6 inches from the system.  I watched them do this, and was also walked out there, and the hose where they said the leak was coming from, was pointed out to me.  Anyone who fixes these cars, is supposed to know that this cooling system is pressurized.  The leaky water pump was causing the coolant system to run at less pressure than normal, all summer, and then as soon as the leak was fixed, and optimal pressure was achieved, it immediately caused a crack in the container where you pour the coolant into this car.  The change back to normal pressure was too sudden for the integrity of the coolant bottle.  The Purrfect guys completely missed this crack, incorrectly identified the source of the leak, and gave an explanation, that since, I have re-told to three more garages in three different states, a Chrysler dealership in my hometown, another Purrfect location in Las Vegas, and a Napa repair center, and they all have said the same thing, that the too much coolant explanation is a complete B.S., nonsense explanation.  The Purrfect manager told us the car would be fine, and my wife and I drove it to San Diego on Friday, September 12th, to see her family for her baby shower, because she is 7 weeks from giving birth to our first child.  The first time we stopped for gas in Barstow, and turned off the car, the coolant leaked out all over the ground.  We put a little more in, but barely made it the rest of the way.  During the trip I called the Purrfect place back, and the young man that answers the phone said that everything would be fine, there was still just a little excess coolant in there, and the temperature would not be an issue.  We made it to San Diego running the heater at full blast with the windows down, and at midnight, finally had to pull over on Interstate 5, in Carlsbad, and had to have AAA town the car to my father-in-law's preferred repair center, because the engine temperature gauge was approaching the red zone, and it normally is just below the middle.  By 5pm on Saturday, September 13th, my father-in-law's guys had caught the crack in the coolant bottle, replaced it, gave the correct explanation, and since then, the car has run perfectly, and cruised all the way back to Vegas from San Diego on Sunday, September 14th, with not even so much as a rattle.  My basic 10th grade knowledge if the ideal gas law, is how I smelled a rat after that too much coolant explanation, however, my benefit of the doubt initially, with these guys, caused me to be stranded on the side of an interstate after midnight, with a wife a few weeks into her 3rd trimester of pregnancy, 300 miles from home, and caused me to be at a repair center rather than my wife's first, and possibly only, baby shower.  Thank God I have AAA, and thank God I paid attention in chemistry class, because these guys obviously didn't.  The only two contact numbers listed for this company on the website, also, are not valid.  They are dead ends.\n\nAnswer:",

So going to the Heinz History Center made sense. After passing by billboards for the Pittsburgh's sunken steamboat the Arabia I decided to go. I had been in the great hall of the building, which is super gorgeous, so my hopes were high. I brought my 5 year old on Memorial Day and delighted to find out his admission was free, but mine was 15 bucks. The steamboat exhibit for the Arabia was decent. The kid's areas were boring and my kid was quickly over them. The museum isn't terrible but its seems to have old school exhibit styles in this  modern chic loft space. Some of the exhibits were more modern and well- presented and others were just those corny mannequins with blurbs. Maybe I struggled to find the cohesion in the lay out here.

I was not expecting to be strapped to my bike via my shoes (which resulted in disastrous hilarity later), and after one of the folks working there adjusted my bike for me, I realized quickly that it was incorrect.  While I tried to fix it myself, I couldn't get myself off the bike and nearly toppled over trying to do it while still hopelessly locked in.  \\n\\nThen the lights went down (again, not what I was expecting) and the music blasted and an instructor who looked like his name should be Chad started the class, dramatically lit...fitting with the whole Zoolander vibe.  I did my best to keep up but I was barely touching my handlebar with my fingertips so I wasn't able to do a whole lot more than balance myself and not fall down.

God forbid, you leave a tip at the end of your meal where you serve yourself.

She even said we couldn't get refills on our iced teas, oj's, or sodas.... I thought this was a buffet. Luckily she brought the manager over and they had an argument about refills in front of us because our server wanted us to \\\"see it.\\\" Whatever that means. When we asked her if something was wrong, she went on a rant about how only god can judge her and then things turned from bad to worse. I guess that God justifies bad service, rudeness, and denies us new silverware. But in a turn of fate, after being open about our concerns, she gave our table all of her attention before leaving in the middle of our meal. After she left, our new server didn't even look at our table, introduce herself, clear off plates, or anything that has to Do with good service. But we tracked her down on the other side of the restaurant and got some refills. I would like to think that maybe they just hate us, but we were not the only ones who were yelled at or ignored. Clearly customer service is not a priority. The management here obviously  doesn't want people coming back, seeing as how rude they were.

Knowledge to have before you book a table here is that it is pricier than most, but I don't think it's too extortionate considering it's clearly aimed at the higher end of the market, plus there are a fair few restaurants in Edinburgh that operate on similar price levels, and I do think Edinburgh can be a pretty expensive city in general.\\n\\nI had a meal at the Tower for my birthday a while back, and was unsure what to expect, aside from brillant views across Edinburgh, which the venue certainly delivers. Can't beat a fantastic view on a good day while you're eating your food, so that elevates the experience before you've really started to analyse the meal. I went for the juicy and mostly always satisfying steak option, which was slightly more well done than I would have liked, however I think this was because I asked for it to be cooked medium, when I really should have asked for it to be rare. I think it was more a shift in the way I like to eat a steak, than an inaccurate cooking judgment on the restaurant's part.

The 80's was my time and it definately took me back to a carefree fun time it was like being at a party. I will be seeing this one again.\n\nAnswer:",

Option: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive.\nText: I don't always take time to write a review but when I do, it' is usually: for an exceptionally good or  poor service. Unfortunately, this time it is the latter. Being from California, I came to Auto Air & Electric by referral from someone I got to know locally. This person has been in the auto field for a long time and recommended AA&E as people with knowledge, experience  and integrity. Raving reviews on Yelp provided further assurance that it would be the right place to have my Mazda 626's  problem fixed and without hesitation I went to the shop. Upon walking in, I stumbled into Mike at the desk. Mentioning the name of the referring party did not seem to make much of an impression and I proceeded describing my problem. The issue at hand was a non-working A/C system. Most places I had taken the car to for estimates kept looking in the wrong direction and were inclined to think that it was a faulty compressor. A friend who works on cars out of his garage was nice enough to do a great deal of preliminary testing and conclusively ruled it out. Everything was pointing to an electric system.  It must be noted that I came to the shop not exactly as a first time novice with an attitude \\\"The car has a problem, please fix it\\\".  I had some grasp of the issue, had done some \\\"homework\\\" and just needed to establish the missing link. I felt that with the information I provided AA&E and with their level of expertise it would be a slam dunk. Judging from Mike's lack of interest of  my preliminary findings, I understood he was  keen at tackling the problem from the bottom up. This approach may have its merits, but I felt, and my feeling was later affirmed, that many of the steps they intentionally or unintentionally took were unnecessary as they had duplicated steps taken by my friend. The repair was started with the basic inspection ($40) which I predicted would not be productive use of time, but Mike insisted it was the right way to do it. 30 min. later he peeked inside to get an approval for the next step up ($125) a more thorough examination. After nearly 5 hours in the shop and $290 lighter (a repair of a short circuited wire bundle, something I had known about, had to be made in the process) I was being told that possibly a relay ($75 special order item) was causing the issue. I was to leave the car in the shop as the part would arrive the next day. Extremely disappointed, to say the least, with the growing costs and no end in sight, I declined and left. Soon after I returned to California and was fortunate to have found a not so fancy shop in one of the industrial areas of LA. Armed with information I provided him, the Spanish speaking mechanic, despite poor command of English quickly got a grasp of the problem and in 45 min. cracked the puzzle. Cherry on the icing was the fact that he charged me only $50 for labor. No parts had to be ordered. None of the \\\"let's do preliminary diagnostic\\\" BS. He tinkered with the car and charged me for producing  an actual result rather than an hourly rate while just going through the motions. Based on my overall experience, I feel this rating  would be the most appropriate.\n\nAnswer:",

So, it was an OK choice on occasional nights when we didn't feel like cooking or just wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\nThat is, until last night. After first waiting for 15 minutes for any wait staff to appear, then waiting an additional several minutes for our waters to arrive (not to mention the additional 10 minutes for the single beer to brought out), then waiting for quite some time for our meals to arrive, we discovered that somehow 1 order wasn't placed. At this point it was a full hour from when we were seated. I waited an additional 10-15 minutes for my salad to arrive. The manager stopped by to offer chips and salsa, but we'd already had an app with the 2 for $20, so we declined.\\n\\nAt this point, the kids were tired and restless, and ready to head home. I packed my salad in a to go box and asked for the check. They offered a 10% discount, which amounted to less than $3 on the total bill. Unfortunately, at this point we discovered that the restaurant had stopped the kids eat free plan as well. \\n\\nSo, all told, the meal took twice as long as we planned, with a lot more hassle than necessary, and we spent more than the quality of food warranted, and certainly more than the overall experience warranted.\\n\\nSince the primary reasons we chose Applebee's on nights like last night were the convenience and relative cheap cost, we won't bother going back in the future.\n\nAnswer:",

Not wanting to make a fuss, we sat anyway and I thought surely she'd bring a cloth to wipe the table when she brought the menus... No... I had to ASK for her to clean the table... Then I has to ask for cutlery when our starters arrived.. (I was secretly hoping she would have noticed we didn't have cutlery while wiping the table and bring us some before our food arrived...) Maybe she just thought deep fried camembert is best consumed using fingers...??\\n\\nD's bangers & mash arrived around about lukewarm and judging by the amount of gravy him and P went thru, I assume the mash was pretty dry.... My venison pie was ok.. no complaints but nothing I'm rushing back for...M said her buffalo burger was very good, so maybe will have to try that next time...\\n\\nD was going to order dark choc & cherry ice cream but they \\\"should really change the menu because we've not had it for ages now\\\"...

The waiter actually lied to us and I caught him and he knows I caught him! Everything was fine. Food was pretty good and my party and I even discussed coming back because we thought the food was good. While waiting for our food we asked for more bread. Alfredo, our waiter barely acknowledged our request but we knew he heard us. We waited and the bread never came. Our food arrives and we ask for the bread again. He barely acknowledges us again. Still no bread. We're almost done eating. Alfredo comes and says bread is being freshly made and will be about 10 minutes. We say fine. A few minutes later I catch Alfredo surreptitiously, rushing by with a basket of bread to another table! Unbelievable! Then he comes back to our table, without bread, mind you, and asks if we need anything else. I ask what the deal with the bread is and he says, of course, he'll bring it right away! I say never mind, just bring the check... I did call the GM to make her aware of what happened but we will never be going back there. Again, food was good. If you want decent food with bad service, then check it out. Your choice.\n\nAnswer:",

Yes, yes, YEEEESSS!!  When Maounds suggested this place for dinner, I was skeptical at first.  A nice restaurant in The Plaza?  Are you sure?  But I trust her (and her palate) so I went with it.  Man, oh, MAN, I am glad I did!\\n\\nThe decor is super sexy.  A giant wall of window looks out onto Fremont Street, so if you hit it at the right time, you can see the light show.  The lighting in the restaurant is dark and sultry.  It was very modern with clean lines and dark wood too.  You would swear you are not Downtown at all.\\n\\nThe food was incredible.  Everything is tapas style so you can have a bite of everything (or hog a couple of plates just for yourself, like I did).  I had the tomato basil soup with grilled cheese (BRIE!) and the ham and cheese croquettes.  The soup was delicious, as was the grilled cheese (though the bread was a little too soft and flakey for my taste) and the ham and cheese croquettes were incredible (but share these because they are rich and you don't want to over-do it).  I only drank beer since I did not want to mix my liquor for the night.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the thai beef salad and he really, really liked it.  Generally he like potatoes with his meat, so I was surprised it got such rave reviews.  He also raved about the sliders with the bleu cheese (and he is no bleu cheese fan at all).  Maounds had the bacon wrapped dates and something else, all of which she loved.  She also had a carmel apple martini and she is not one to normally drink the frou frou cocktails.  You know how to make people want to come out of their comfort zone, Firefly.  That is a sign of a great restaurant!\\n\\nNext time I am Vegas, I will definitely be back here!  I cannot WAIT!\n\nAnswer:",

The place has a similar feel to it's Uptown cousin Nix and started off giving pretty good vibes. It looks nice and there was a good crowd inside. They even have a nice looking outdoor seating area. \\nUnfortunately, we never got the chance to experience the food! They were already out of the wings on special. After this bit of bad news, we asked for a minute to pick something else, but put in an appetizer order. Quite a while later the server came back and dropped off the drinks, but before we could even stop her to finally place our order she was gone...and didn't return before our drinks were finished (about 20 minutes). We decided to give up on eating since God knows how long it might have taken to actually get the food if we ever finally got to place an order.     \\nOther notes: \\n-The booth was covered in grease and crumbs so apparently somebody actually was served food at this table at one point\\n-Getting to the restroom was kind of a cluster maneuvering through the servers entering orders\\n-The whole place seemed almost chaotic and unorganized with food and drinks being brought to wrong tables\\n\\nMaybe another week of preparation before the opening would've been a good idea. i'm hoping the kinks will get worked out soon because we really want to like this place. It still got 2 stars because they are brand new and i'm sure we'll try it again in the future.

I've been to beauty schools before for hair services and have not always been happy. I went into Paul Mitchell wanting a cut and color.\\n\\nI was assigned to Taylor, Mika and a \\\"protege\\\" named Cassie. I brought pictures of both the cut and color I wanted, which helped a ton. They brought out the color book and figured out what color dye they should use based on my natural color and the dye already in my hair. I'd never seen so much thought go into picking a color and now I know why they do it: it came out perfect! The cut also went super well and I'm really happy with it. \\n\\nThe salon is clean, bright and open. The students all seem very happy and at ease. They work really well with each other and the instructors. The price for my services was discussed before anything was done, which was much appreciated. My color ended up being $35, as they had to use two bowls of dye (I have a lot of hair!). The cut was treated as an add-on to the chemical service, so it was only $10.\\n\\nThe only negative was the time my services took. I was there for close to 5 hours.

While I did like their selection of glasses, the place has less than mediocre service.  The doctor's appointment was fine.  All I wanted to know was if my glasses prescription needed to be increased.  The final bill was for more things than what I needed, which meant I paid for more than what I'd hoped to receive.  Also the glasses I purchased are transition polycarbonate lenses.  Up until a year into it, they were fine.  Since then the transition film has become covered in tiny cracks covering the entirety of both lenses.  Naturally they only guaranteed their work for 1 year.  \\nBeware of the transition lenses from this place.  Do your research first! Transitions Optical, the company that created these lenses that darken in sunlightt, says you should get a certificate of authenticity at the time of purchase and are warrantied by Transitions Optical for two years.  I did not receive a certificate of authenticity.  The multitude of tiny cracks going across my transition lenses make things appear blurry, as if I weren't wearing glasses!   I wouldn't advise doing business here.

We went over a 4th of July weekend in the summer so prices were jacked way up. Honestly, for what we paid, I can't say MHI was worth it. But looking at their standard rate card, prices seem to improve during regular days (although regardless they seem more like Chicago prices than Madison prices to this Chicago-ite)\\n\\nWe arrived in the afternoon and had to ring a doorbell to gain admittance. This was a standard procedure every time we came back: guests do not receive a key to the exterior door and someone is up 24/7 to let you in. When we walked in, there was a beautiful bar and sitting area to our left, and a lounge with fireplace to our right. We were shown our room which was an \\\"english basement\\\" style room. Not too much light, but nicely appointed, frette sheets, aveda bath products, a heated bathroom floor, and terry cloth robes. A small desk, sitting chair, large bureau, a chest of drawers, and 42\\\" flat screen completed the decor. Oh, and a huge picture of Lance Armstrong. Huh? Yeah, turns out Trek the bike company owns the whole place, oddly enough. So don't be surprised when you see B&W biking pictures everywhere. \\n\\nAnyways, the bed was extremely comfortable and we heard absolutely no noise the entire time we were in our room despite the Inn having several other occupants. The staff were quite pleasant and helpful when we hung out in the lounge, making us feel quite welcome and comfortable with a never ending supply of nuts and candy, and eating (the included) continental breakfast on the deck off the lounge was a nice experience. \\n\\nThe Inn overall is beautifully decorated; think lots of marble, wood, and restored tile. And a wonderful circular staircase up the middle of the house. I wouldn't do the lower floor room again though (room 3.) It was dead quiet, but also dark and a little gloomy. They pitched us specifically on that room vs. another because it was larger, but I'd rather have light than a few extra square feet the next time.\n\nAnswer:",

She is obsessed with all things spicy, tears will be streaking down her face and she will still say it isn't spicy enough, but even she struggled with the omelet. Maybe not that it was too spicy but that it tasted like crap spicy. \\n\\nAnyways, about 10 minutes after trying to eat my slime it hit me like a brick, I made a beeline to the bathroom and was in there for about 10 minutes only to return 5 more times. \\n\\nAs you can imagine the 10 hour car ride home was horrible.

Option: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive.\nText: This place is the main setting of one of the most miserable nights of my life that didn't involve someone dying or me throwing up on my date or something.  Anyway, I'll spare those details and just focus on what a terrible experience this restaurant was.  To begin let me state in the interest of full disclosure that I live in Dallas.  This affords me the opportunity to eat some damn fine Tex-Mex, but it does not make me a Mexican snob.  I'm every bit as comfortable eating at a chain in my native St. Louis as I am at some of the better places I have found in Dallas or anywhere else.  All I ask is that it is good.  Frank and Lupe's is not good.  The people in my party wanted Mexican and several people affiliated with our hotel recommended Frank and Lupe's as the \\\"BEST MEXICAN IN TOWN!!\\\"  I see that in some of the reviews here, too.  Either these people are getting kick backs or Scottsdale has a seriously terrible Mexican restaurant scene.\\n\\nFirst off, upon our arrival we were quoted a wait time of 35 minutes inside and an hour on the patio.  Ok, guess we're eating inside, no problem.  Unfortunately, 35 minutes turned into nearly an hour to sit in the hot, cramped dining area.  We would have been much better off waiting for the patio and taking our chances.  There are few restaurant sins bigger than undershooting the wait time by almost half.  Off by 5 or 10 minutes?  Still crappy but it happens.  20+ minutes?  No excuse.  This highlights another problem with this place.  It is tiny.  There is no place to wait.  I guess we could have squeezed into the over-full patio and hoped for the best, but otherwise you're standing out on the street on a tiny crowded sidewalk with all the other unfortunate souls about to be subjected to the horrors that are apparently \\\"the best Mexican in town\\\".\\n\\nAs you can imagine, after waiting an hour for a table, our party was starving.  Luckily we were at a Mexican place, so we knew we were getting chips and salsa, so we waited...and waited...and waited and finally we hounded the hostess after 10 minutes of sitting there with nothing on the table.  Then we got the \\\"chips\\\" which were actually more like some thick bastard offspring of a chip and a taco bell chalupa shell.  Did I mention they were cold, too?  Warm chips can hide a magnitude of crimes, but not at Frank and Lupe's.  And the salsa was some watery, runny mess.  Yuck.  And what's that I see on the menu?  $2 for more chips?  Luckily the chips were terrible and they would have had to pay me $2 to take more of them, but seriously?  No one I have mentioned this to since has ever seen a charge for chips at a Mexican restaurant.  Was I reading this wrong?  Is this only if I don't order anything besides chips?  Surely it was, right?\\n\\nMoving on...after another good 10 minutes our waiter finally came around for our orders.  I ordered a number 6. I was presented a choice of a green or red sauce.  Being from out of town I asked for the waiter's opinion.  He told me he would get the red but \\\"its a little spicy.\\\"  This is important because it was the exaggeration of the century.  Before the meal came out I had finished my first diet coke.  Of course I did because it was like 30 minutes between getting the diet coke and getting the food.  Anyway, I specifically waited for another diet coke before I started the \\\"little spicy\\\" meal.  Then I dig in and I eat...and I eat...and I eat.   In fact, I finished the entire entree before I even felt a hint of spice in my mouth, and even then it wasn't much more robust than Medium Pace picante sauce.  Huge disappointment.  To tell the truth, the whole meal was bland.  There was basically no flavor even under the \\\"little spicy\\\" (emphasis on little, I guess) sauce and the rice was  apparently just plain rice with a little shredded cheese melted onto it.  So, we finished our meal, all massively disappointed, and then it was another 10 minutes until we could get the check and then after that we had to flag down another hostess to actually pay the check because our waiter was MIA.  You might say it was because they were busy, but we didn't start eating until almost 8 and by the time we were done closer to 9, the restaurant was at least half empty.\\n\\nThe biggest disappointment for me is how many interesting sounding places I passed by walking to this place.  Unfortunately, my party wanted Mexican and the hotel suggested this dump.  I had one meal out on the town in Scottsdale, on an expense account to boot, and I wasted it on this utterly forgettable hole in the wall disaster.  In fact, I take that back.  I will never forget Frank and Lupe's.  It goes on the Wall of Shame.  Learn from my error, fellow Yelpers.\n\nAnswer:",

I am very critical of freshness. I'm used to cooking at home with freshly prepared everything so when I go out, I want something better than I could have made myself. This fell short in many ways. For example, the fresh tomato salsa served with my fajitas was spent. The flavors were all muted and the tomatoes had been chopped at least a day ago, possibly more. You could see they were dark, and breaking down into mush. The fajita meat had a good grilled flavor, but dry and overcooked. I ordered them with chiles for an extra dollar expecting to have them on the sizzling plate with my fajita meat, especially since they advertise their fresh roasted Hatch chiles on site, but instead they were brought a few minutes later after my meal was served, in a separate dish, cold, mushy, looking like they just came out of a can. I asked for fresh lime to squeeze over my meat and overcooked onions, and got brown dry, lime wheels served on the side of my margarita glass instead. And the margaritas! Okay the first one was .99 cents so I'm not going to complain. But the next one was a very large overpriced one that just tasted like watered down cheap margarita mix. My rice was precooked, dry and old, and way too salty. My husband's chimichanga was basically a big burrito covered in some massive amount of sauce, but it was not deep fried as I thought a chimichanga is supposed to be. Or if it was, it wasn't cooked enough because it was mushy. My kids cheese crisp was... lame. My other kid's mini chimis looked appetizing and he liked them, but they ruined the dish by putting this brightly artificially colored red mini tostada bowl on the plate filled with sour cream that had been sitting in the refrigerator either uncovered, or at the wrong temperature because it had a yellowish brown layer of old cream on the top that was just gross. Apparently they make those up ahead of time too with no quality control. Also it was very hot inside the restaurant which worried me about the safety and sanitation of the kitchen. I agree with others that the service was friendly, when they were actually there. I think it's a bit overpriced, for the quality. We spent $115 with tip, but that was two margaritas and one desert, 3 entrees, one app, one kids meal. I'd rather of had Taco Bell. And the chips were no big deal. If you've made chips at home and experienced what they taste like you would never want restaurant ones again. The texture, freshness, flavor can't be beat. I know what you are all thinking. Stay home then and cook. I usually do for just this reason. Oh and one more thing. The apple sopapilla desert was terrible. The pastry dough was chewy, and lacked salt. Tasted like chewy dish rag.\n\nAnswer:",

She forgot our bread and salad until we asked, just as our entrees arrived. Salad had a good dressing, but nothing special other than that. Bread was not warm, and had 1 small sized piece - too small for sharing amongst the two of us, but we skipped it since it wasn't warm.

I was there tonight with some friends for a birthday and I can honestly say that it was the worst service that I've ever seen. The waitress never came around to check on us, maybe every 40 minutes or so. So instead of ordering our drinks from her, we tried the bar, which was just as bad. Two of us were standing at the bar for around 30 minutes and never had a bartender get our drinks, so I just left. It was ridiculous to say the least.

This is not even a food review..we walked out prior to being served. If your not a regular or a goombah, then you really don't need to eat here unless you like getting ignored and pissed. Took my dad her on his Vegas visit and we were seated in the corner room of their old place. There was a big party in the main room, but we were seated and then nobody even gave us menu's for 15 minutes and then after nobody else came over to take my order, I just flipped out on the idiot owners there. His lame apology was pathetic and I really wanted to punch him that night for sorta ruining the evening. Bootlegger Bistro saved the night. Who cares how good the food is if you can't even get a waiter to your table on a half-empty weekend night.

The name sounded familiar, so we decided to stop here instead. There were a few other patrons waiting for tables inside so we opted to sit on the patio where we could be seated right away. The whole restaurant is really clean and the patio is no exception (although once a large party with multiple kids who were sitting on the patio left, it took them awhile to clean up). Once we were seated I quickly looked up what other yelpers had to say and it looks like this location is pretty new.\\n\\nI ordered a simple bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style and and iced tea for myself, and my daughter got the kids chicken strips with fries and a chocolate milk.

If I buy a croissant, I want it to flake and make a mess and I want to be able to taste the buttery pastry. Not at Essence.\\n\\nThe macarons - People, it's MACARON, not macaroon. Huge difference. The flavors are not anything special or unique, just standard flavors you'll see at any French pastry shop. The espresso macaron tastes exactly like tiramisu, vanilla is very good, all the citrus ones are great but chocolate is lacking that chocolatey punch. Their filling can be too warm and runny at times, which is bad for buttercream. There have been times I can tell by looking at it that it's been over baked but I give them the benefit of the doubt and take it home anyway. Big mistake. If it has been over baked for a minute, it won't make a big difference on the texture but unfortunately for me, I've been sold ones so over baked it ended up being a brick on the edges and overly chewy on the inside. Once I was lucky enough to return it but other times, I had to toss it.

I do not concur with the company policy that lead to their joining the ranks of the unemployed, because they had some seriously top-notch recommendations for the adventurous beer drinker. It was through their recommendations that I sampled some of Lee's better offerings and their loss is sorely missed.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I AM a girl who enjoys herself some booze, so I will continue shopping here. However, I'm hard pressed to put a can of MGD or 'Bud' to my lips and actually enjoy. If I have any say in the matter what-so-ever, I'd do a jig and a half to have a Leinenkugels Sunset Wheat or a Hoegaarden, a Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre or even a Negro Modelo instead. I like beer, and I like beer with flavor. Not a donkey-punch to the tongue bitter, of course, but something with a distinctive flavor that sets it apart from the water. \\n\\nLee's has a vast selection of unique beers to choose from, including Delerium Nocturnum and Delirium Noel, which are both delicious. There are also lots of European imports and microbrew beers worth trying. I like that individual large bottles are available, making it easier to sample flavors that may otherwise be too intimidating to buy in a whole 6 pack. Banana Bread beer, Chocolate Stout or Orange Creme anyone?  \\n\\nThere are also aisles and aisles of wines, flavored liquors and mixers. There are so many flavors and varieties to choose from, including Absinthe and awesome bar-stockers like high quality Tequilas, Italian liquors, etc. If I had my way, I'd stock up a huge surplus of bottles to experiment with various cocktails.  \\n\\nAlso, they have Cock n' Bull Ginger Beer, which is delicious and I recommend trying it. It's a non-alcoholic, fizzy, sharp ginger bite in a glass bottle. I'd like to make a cocktail with it sometime. \\n\\nThe prices are pretty reasonable, especially for their beers and the hours are pretty normal, closing at either 9 or 10 pm. It'd be nice if they were open later, but c'est la vie. \\n\\nSo if you need something to drink and are feeling a little adventurous, stop in and look around. There's bound to be something you'd like, even if it's a fuzzy navel wine cooler.\n\nAnswer:",

Triple 7's is a nearly 24hr restaurant located in the Main Street Station Casino and is a cooler looking spot to have a beer but lacks in the food department\\n\\nParking:\\nTons of parking in the Main Street Casino Lot\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nProbably the coolest restaurant in downtown. Kinda of a Gordin Biersch type of feel.  Huge breweries on one side and kitchen on the other.\\n\\nService:\\nFor the most part the 6 times I've eaten here went problem free. Sure most of the times its been after midnight when it was slow but all the waiters/waitresses have been more than adequate.  Beware of the weird hours.\\n\\nCost:\\nPrices will run you around 7-11$ per person but overall its pretty cheap.  If you're getting sushi(in which I never have) each item will run you about 3-4$ which can easily get pricey. During happy hour(3-6pm M-F) they have a decent happy hour of $5 appetizers and better yet $2 beer & wines.  If you happen to be from Hawaii and are here with \\\"Vacations Hawaii\\\" then this restaurant participates in the food voucher program but your selection is kind of limited to mostly burgers and appetizers.\\n\\nFood:\\nSo I've been here 6 times and for the most part I haven't been impressed. Sure most of the times I've had a free meal voucher which limited me to certain items but nothing was \\\"great\\\" on any of my trips. In fact my last visit I ordered the meat loaf which was just plain horrible. The meat loaf came out as a white pre made patty(which I assume was frozen) and has the texture of tofu made product.  The gravy was your typical packaged powered gravy that you would buy for $0.75 in the store.  If you go here stick with a simple burger or the pizzas have looked good\\n\\nConclusion:\\nTriple 7 looks the part of a good brewery restaurant but just doesn't cut it on the food end. I'm pretty sure they have the same chefs as the big buffet next door because the food seem to be mass produced and on the cheaper end.  If you need a place to watch a game or go for after hour then it's not bad but don't get your hopes up.\n\nAnswer:",

There are times when I've had a blast (aka winning money) and other times where I wish I never hit the casino in the first place!  But I do like the dealers and crowd here for the most part.

Looking at the reviews you should see a common thread, the food is good if sometimes inconsistent, the service in horrendous.  Not bad, really horrendous, as in stupendously  bad.  Bad in a way you really dont want to use the word bad, it deserves so much worse.\\n\\nWe showed up at 11:50 for our 12 o'clock reservation we then had the opportunity to stare at the reservation desk for 5 minutes because the woman who was supposed to be the hostess was nowhere to be found.  Finally got sat down as the hostess was talking on the phone while trying to seat us, oh such spectacular manners.  After being sat down bartender came and asked us if we would like drinks.  Explained that we would like the Champagne and Trifle special.  He left our iced tea showed up five minutes later.  Our server took our order of the Sampler Appetizer and brunch items and then wait began...the long long wait.  \\n\\nAfter waiting 25 minutes no sign of the bartender and someone we hadn't seen before brought out a salad...no sampler platter, but a salad...that no one ordered.  So I'm at 25 minutes no iced tea left, sitting on the patio thinking something to drink might be nice.  My favorite smarmy bartender walks by and I ask him about the champagne ordered almost 30 minutes prior.  \\\"Well you aren't qualified for that special\\\", now let's discount the fact that I spent six years in college so I'm generally able to read simple offers with no assistance.  My friendly bartender obviously was not that intelligent.  Explaining to him the offer and the fact that I did indeed qualify for it I would like it fulfilled he left, as he left I asked to speak to the manager.  7 minutes later out he comes...I of course still dont have the appetizer that was order over 30 minutes  earlier.  I get an apology and an excuse from him, I really wasn't in the mood for either.  The last thing I want to hear is \\\"Well I just got in\\\" a much more acceptable response would have been \\\"You should not have to deal with these kind of issues when choosing to dine here.  I will make sure that everything is taken care of for you.\\\"  That could have salvaged the entire meal.\\n\\nAt this point I just assumed that Mr \\\"I just got here\\\" Manager would make sure everything else was going to be smooth.  I overestimated his ability to run a restaurant.  My wife went without anything to drink for over 10 minutes.  We finally received our food 48 minutes after sitting down.  Not bad if we were ordering something more complex than a filet sandwich with greens or fish and chip sliders.  Of course the side of curry sauce I ordered could not be delivered with my meal.  Instead I waited another 7 minutes for that and they still managed to still charge me an extra dollar for a sauce for my cold fries.\\n\\nGenerally the theme for this meal was the food was ok, when it was delivered correctly.  The service in case I forgot to mention it....was horrid, I would use a different word that horrid if I could find one that would turn my stomach dealing with the complete incompetence I had to deal with.\\n\\nIf after reading this you choose to eat at English's Quintessentially Slow Gastro Pub (I stole the \\\"Quintessentially Slow\\\" part from a friend of mine who happens to be a genius) I hope your experience is better than mine because I'm fairly certain it could not be worse.  I forgot the cherry on top of this experience was the Bartender telling me taking care of drinks wasn't his job.\\n\\nUpdate- ** I have great respect for an organization that states \\\"Our goal is to provide the kind of unique and genuine sort of personal care and attention that our customers tell stories about\\\" That certainly was not my experience on Sunday as reflected in my review.  What also is not stated in that review is the spot note I received from the owner after reading my review.  Too often restaurants are way too quick to offer free drinks or meals to compensate for problems and layer apologies on top of that.  What I have found is sadly lacking is someone willing to take accountability of problems.  In this instance Jacob at English's has risen far above his peers.  Hopefully I will in the future have an opportunity to dine at English's and have an experience that I can \\\"tell stories about\\\"  At the least I am now convinced that at least one person at English's understands and has a passion for the food service industry.\n\nAnswer:",

We discovered the Bistro Buffet, and decided to give it a try. \\n\\nThe restaurant has a very nice look to it. It is modern in appearance, and has an upscale cafeteria feel about it. It is one of the smallest buffets that I have been to in Las Vegas, but getting seated was not an issue. \\n\\nThe food was not very good. Most of it was cold, and tasted as though it had been sitting around for hours. Condiments were very hard to find, and the whole setup in general seemed disorganized. The one highlight from the food selection was the crab legs. They were fairly big and pre-cut to make them easier to peel open and eat. \\n\\nThe other highlight of eating here was that the service was excellent. Our waiter kept our cups filled and cleared our dishes whenever we finished a plate. He was very accommodating and was able to help us with whatever we needed. The service made up a little bit for the food being sub par. \\n\\nOverall, the Bistro Buffet was a disappointment. The food just wasn't good.

They massage your feet and stomach during the colonic.  (Some people may prefer to be left alone, and they will if you request) However, I think you benefit from getting the stomach massage.  Although, it feels like torture during the process.  Getting a colonic is not my favorite thing to do, but this place makes the best of an awkward situation.

They keep it very clean.. But the environment is the same.. And there is not much change. We joined for a year and we were going to join another venue until we were reminded of the classes they offered. We looked online and unlike the owners reply to Wrennae, there is a description.. But don't let that fool you. There is a class called silly safari, old fashioned fun (you think soup can stilts, tag, duck, duck goose.. ) and a variety of others. Also the preschool prep which is what sold us into returning. My husband and I were so excited that we took my son there every day to try something new. Each time we were thrown aback to find that each class was an art class.. They cannot even call it a class, you come in, all the supplies are out, she flashes a sample of what they are making and you do it and go back in the main area to continue on your play. Even the preschool prep promised a circle time and we sat at the table and the only movement we got was walking to the table. No interaction.. Nothing.. We sat there and listened to a story, then did a craft. The craft had nothing to do with the story even, no lesson learned. I couldn't believe it. \\nShe also said that I was the only one who complained about the classes and everyone else loves them. Gee thanks for making me feel comfortable. Oh and the next time I came in, the teacher didn't even look up at me. She just buzzed me in! And the other girl working at the desk kept looking at us with a confused look on her face. When I woudl look at her, she looked away. Interesting. Not cool. My comments should have been handled with a lot more care. \\nI contacted the owner Vanessa, and the first email was nice and she said she would look into the teacher's curriculum and asked me to give it time for a change. \\nI returned a month later and nothing changed! :( it was yet another craft with another paper plate! I emailed her when I got home and was so surprised that she commented in her email response, \\\"I'm not sure what you expected for $7 per month. Wow.. Being, like Wrennae said in a previous customer comment, that this was there only selling point.. Wow. Way to set the expectations low for your business, customers and kids. I even said, it doesn't need to cost money, just put on music and dance.. She was so rude to me and woudl not refund me for the year I paid.. Not even for the classes. She didn't even get back to me. Rude. \\nI went on the website and noticed that the class titles have changed. So she did listen to me finally I guess.. Which proves that I was right.. And wasted a whole 4 months.. Not sure if the content is the same. I haven't visied in a bit. But I looked at the pics posted on facebook and there are a ton of crafts posted.. And the majority of them are paper plates! Lol \\nDon't waste your money here. Lame. \\nIt is clean, indeed, but the toys are lame and the environment is stark and there is very little for the kids to do.\\nIn reply to Vanessa's rebuttle:\\nYes, I was a member for a year before. I have told you this before, yet I guess I will state this all again but in public. I didn't try classes before. I saw the online description and was wowed and wanted to do that instead. I am not sure why you are shouting with bold lettering when depicting that the alternative business I was looking into was out of business. This business is what we we're going to o sign up with and yes it was more expensive, but money or going out of business is not the issue. You trying to depict a service falsely is the issue. I went to each class and regardless at what the description said, I got a craft. Your description for preschool prep which is the reason we joined mainly, was so far form the truth. It says movement, and circle time, letters and so on.. No. Movement consists of walking in the door to sit at a table and turn our heads to listen to a story and then make a craft. So, the only difference between the other \\\"classes\\\" and this preschool prep was a story! Lol \\nAlso, you didn't protect my identity when I came to you in confidence to tell you something I felt was an issue. You went to the staff and not only dictated the issue, but allowed my name to travel because when I returned I was treated rudely. I complained again to tell you nothing changed and you shoved me aside. Then when I emailed you back in seriousness, I noticed you changed your class names as I urged. As each class represented something different in title and description, yet there was no change in any form class to class. \\nAnd if these classes are only craft activities, then say so. Or this lack of service delivery becomes a legal issue. Becaus you promise one thing and don't deliver, it is unethical. Along with name defamation, and hostile environment. \\n I am simply saying that 6 months ago, I signed up for somehting I did not receive. i signed up for classes. The classes dipicted online were very differnt than what was delivered and this is where the issue lies.\n\nAnswer:",

But it seemed like the line took soooo long to move. There's only one person taking orders as well as handing out the crepes once they are done. I actually noticed that my crepe order was ready for a while before the cashier/order taker/food giver noticed. Operations would be much more efficient if they had another person handing out the crepes. \\n\\nIf you're a Total Rewards member, you can get a discount on the crepes, but they also offer a crepe special where you can get a crepe and a drink for less than what the price of a crepe costs. I'm not sure how they make money off of that, but whatever, my mom and I both ordered the special. I got the ham and cheese crepe and my mom got the fresh berry crepe. Both were good, but I thought my ham and cheese was a little dry and could have used more cheese. The fresh berry one could use more berries. For the price we paid, I was expecting a little more. \\n\\nSeating is pretty easy to find as there's an open sitting area next to La Creperie. If the restaurant next door is closed, you can also sit there. \\n\\nI probably would try a crepe again, but only if there wasn't a line!\n\nAnswer:",

In fact, this area of town that was previously mainly coffee and sandwich shops now boasts Tuk Tuk Indian food, The Hanging Bat Americana pulled pork, thai restaurants, the Three Birds for seasonal local Scottish fare, so it's nice to see some Japanese food make this corner of Edinburgh even more delicious.\\n\\nI preface all reviews of sushi restaurants by noting the difference between sushi in the UK, and sushi in California / Australia / Japan itself. Good sushi in the UK and Edinburgh can be very, very good -- but it'll never be the same quality, and value for money, as in the Cali / Japan. Here the UK you'll pay \\u00a325 for enough sushi to feed you for dinner, and it's seen as a delicacy -- not the other way around where you pay $15 and get as much sushi of the highest quality that you can eat, with some beef on the side for good measures. It's just how it goes here.\\n\\nSo with that in mind, Harajuku Kitchen is good sushi, that will satisfy your sushi-cravings in the Burgh, although it is pretty pricey and can leave a wee hole in your pocket without feeling overly full (as is often the way of sushi and value for money).\\n\\nThe sushi they do is lovely. A nice range, with some interesting things I haven't seen before. I went with some rainbow rolls, and mackerel nigiri -- nicely presented on a big plate. My dining partner had a piece of fish in sauce, so there are option that are not-raw and more cooked meals which might suit other palates too.\\n\\nA nice wee restaurant, nice wee sushi pieces, would definitely come back and its a nice fresh addition to the neighbourhood.\n\nAnswer:",

I ordered an almond milk latte and the first two time it was very sweet. The second two lattes had no sweetness at all and one of them tasted like black coffee with a splash of plain almond milk. It seems there is no standard on either how to make these or which milk they are using. When you are paying almost $5 for one, it'd be nice to know what to expect. After the last latte, I decided to give up on those and just go for the black coffee. I tried the gingerbread roast this morning for something festive and the best I can describe it is that it tastes like panang curry. I'm not sure why gingerbread coffee would have such a strong Thai/coconut flavor but it's definitely not spicy or ginger-y at all. What a bummer. This is the closest coffee place to work so I'm really disappointed that even though they want to charge you an arm and a leg, the drinks are never good.

The food was over salty, however, that was not the worst part. The service is the worst in my life. The waitress kept giving us nasty looks and horrible attitudes, she yelled at at one of us for forgetting to sign the receipt. The waiter,waitress or even the boss were talking about us in korean. Maybe they thought we cannot see them pointing and laughing at us. At last, the waitress dropped the bill in front of us when we ate for only 15minutes.

Other scores average.  Went there last night (Sat) with two girlfriends (6:30pm).  Sound system was so loud we couldn't talk to each other and couldn't really have a good discussion with waitress re recommendations.  Shared antipassi.  Had we understood more about how blockbuster good it is we would have selected all the options and just had that.  I asked the waitress to recommend Shrimp salad vs tuna salad and was shocked when she said shrimp because if tuna salad is served seared normally kicks shrimp's ass.  Two of us ordered it and were terribly disappointed.  I agree with another yelper it was a tiny fried popcorn shrimp salad.  I also agree with another yelper - the place is inconsistent.  They need some mystery diners to fine tune their offering.  All that being said I will go again with another group of people and have a totally different experience because we will choose to sit at the bar and drink, snack on the antipassi and listen to music.\n\nAnswer:",

We were as close to being regulars as you could be without working there. The bartenders knew us, the food was good and plentiful, the suds were flowing, and good times were had by all. My, how time changes places.\\n\\nLucky's is one of the few bars on Regent that used to openly accept the college scene while still trying to cater to the locals. The place itself is rather large inside, with a hidden back area. There are tons of flat-screen TVs everywhere, with a few games and blaring music. \\n\\nThe specials used to be great, with dollar corn dogs and beers on Thursdays being my favorite. We knew the bartenders by name and they made good and cheap drinks for us, serving the food quickly. \\n\\nAt some point, it was like a light switch flipped (a former bartender later told us the owner lost it and started demanding change). Immediately the bartenders were sullen every day, making weak drinks and complaining, yes complaining to a customer, about any request that wasn't \\\"vodka sprite\\\" or \\\"beer\\\". They went from loving us (we must've spent hundreds of dollars there over the course of one school year) to verbally expressing their frustration with serving us. \\n\\nThe bar started catering more to the fratty crowds coming from smaller colleges in the area and capitalizing on their drunken tastebuds and open wallets. Some staff left, and the staff that stayed got either lazier or more frazzled. They even lost my friend's credit card one night in their rush. \\n\\nI will always have fond memories of the past Lucky's, but I don't plan on returning anymore.

First, the beer is brewed on location and they have an amazing menu.  Add in the fun ambience and accommodating wait staff and you have a great restaurant.  \\n\\nIf you're in Madison long enough, you'll hear people mention Crop Circle Wheat more than a few times.  It's the best beer the Dane brews.  All the other beers are good too.  You can do a beer sampler if you want to find some other favorites. \\n\\nThere aren't many places that can say they have awesome meatloaf, ravioli, nachos and burgers.  Somehow, the Dane can straddle all of these different flavors and do them extremely well.  That's part of why I have come here so often; no matter what the people in your group want, they can get it here.\\n\\nYou can have many different types of experiences at the Dane based on where you are seated.  The front bar area is super fun and chill if you want to shoot pool, darts, play the jukebox or just watch sports.  The dining area on the top floor is casual and great for groups.  In the basement, you take your own tour of the Dane brewing process, which is fun in itself.  Eating dinner in the basement is more intimate, as its a bit darker with the stone walls.  The best place to eat though is the back beer patio.  On a sunny day or a cool night, its a fun experience that makes the Dane feel like a fancy restaurant without having to pay for it.\\n\\nStaff is awesome.  Just tell them what you want, they'll help you out.  We used to rent out the Dane for large group events, and they were always helpful.  \\n\\nThe Great Dane is an essential Madison experience.\n\nAnswer:",

However, Benelux is one of these places where I will enjoy a pint or two.  \\n\\nThey have all different types of beers that they brew themselves.  Some of them can have high alcohol content so look out for what you get.\\n\\nIf you are sitting on one of the tables, the service can be a little lackluster as others have mentioned.  However, if you sit at the bar you shouldn't have any problems with service.\\n\\nIf you are a little hungry while knocking back a few, they serve European style hot dogs which are surprisingly good.\\n\\nThere is a terrasse out in the summer too, so on a warm summer evening you can sit back relax and enjoy some hand crafted brews.\n\nAnswer:",

The fried green tomato appetizer had a lot of potential, but the tomatoes were overripe and mushy. The batter was good and the horseradish dill sauce was fantastic, but nothing could make the mushy tomato great. \\n\\nSoup of the day was mashed cauliflower, and while it was not refined, it was pretty good. It at least had some cheesy flavor. \\n\\nThe veggie burger made of chickpeas was also limp and mushy with no flavor in itself. The southwestern toppings (guacamole, salsa, jalape\\u00f1os, pepper jack) made it edible, but nothing special. \\n\\nMashed cauliflower was bland and tasteless and gritty, not creamy at all. Mac and cheese was as generic as possible. Couldn't tell if the green beans were canned or fresh, but they were also bland. Nothing great about the biscuit. \\n\\nGrilled eggplant pita was unusual but no strong spices or flavoring.\\n\\nOverall, pretty disappointing.\n\nAnswer:",

Sure, her English is bad, but her attitude is worse.\\nI went in with allergies/a cold after 3pm. yesterday evening, hoping to get a soup to comfort me.  She tossed the menus on the table remarking that she was doing me a favor by placing the lunch menu on the table, even when lunch was technically over.\\nShe went away and chatted in Chinese with the nearby table.  \\nShe came back to my table and I wasn't ready.  It took her 10 minutes to return.  She turned up her nose at me, and began chatting (loudly) with the sushi chef.  My body language showed I was ready, but she came over when she was good and ready.\\n\\nI said that I wanted soup, and asked her for her recommendation, since I was feeling under the weather.  I guess she was disappointed in my order.  She refused to apply herself to the question, giving short, sharp answers, avoiding eye contact, and then stating, \\\"Everyone is different,\\\" so a recommendation was not possible.  She left again for an extended period of time.  I had time to look around at the dirty carpet.  She brought no tea or water.\\n\\nI asked about the spring rolls; were they fried?  She tried to educate me on Chinese cuisine versus Thai with such attitude.  \\\"Excuse me?\\\" I thought to myself, \\\"Does Orient equate with Chinese?\\\"\\n\\nI asked if she had ginger tea.  She said there was only one tea in a yelling tone, and I had better be okay with that!\\n\\nFinally I ordered the Miso soup.  It came in a very small bowl and was not hot enough.  I asked for the tea twice, since it appeared she did not hear me.  She barked at me with the equivalent, \\\"Alright already.\\\"  She plopped it on the table.  Later, when I was finished with my soup, she put her fingers all over the tea nossle.  That was effective in making me leave promptly.  Again, my body language communicated, \\\"Check please!\\\" but she chatted with the sushi chef, never letting him get a word in edgewise.\\n\\nI waited another agonizing 5 minutes for the check and left a 1cent tip.  I mumbled \\\"Never again!\\\" as I left, determined to never frequent this establishment, and to discourage all of my friends and family to steer clear.  As I drove around the back, the kitchen staff stared at me in an unwelcoming manner.\\n\\nI had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before.\n\nAnswer:",

But saying that they come with french bread when they literally come with one piece of crostini is not cool. $3.50 for a soda, absurd! $1.50 for cheese on top of the meatballs, mmmno. And finally, $7 for a side of garlic parmesan fries? I want fries dipped in golden ketchup for that price.

I had few of bites of these also. The cakes were fairly large and of good thickness.  There were lumps of sweet crabmeat, and not \\\"krab\\\".  The veggies were finely diced, as I prefer.  I hate biting into large chucks of veggies.  Great seasoning was used as well, spicy, but not too hot.\\n\\nI will definitely roll back over to Big Al's from The Strip the next time I'm in Vegas.
