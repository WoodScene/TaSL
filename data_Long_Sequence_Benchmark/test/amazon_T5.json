It seems like almost all major artists do it these days. Madonna on Hard Candy, Sherryl Crow on Detours and now Smashing Pumpkins on Zeitgeist. To be honest it sounds just as trite, forced and pretentious when either of them do it. To think that this the same group the recorded Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness with truly classic tracks as \"Tonight, Tonight\" or \"1979\" makes it painfully clear that this is not their best work. Even if one compares with the earlier \"Siamese Dreams\" then one is reminded that they can do so much better then this. \"Doomsday Clock\" is an ok but it lacks the SP aura of earlier releases. 3/5.\n\nAnswer:",

The advice is practical and seems to speak to \"real\" parents of \"real\" babies -- and has about it a gentleness and true regard for both.As far as the a-z format, it works for me much better than one based on chronological development, because so many of the topics covered span different time periods with different babies.Regarding Dr. Sears' fantastic books: I don't see the two at odds at all. In fact, they complement each other very well. In another recent book of hers I read (\"No Cry Sleep Solution\"), she writes, \"Dr. Sears is my parenting hero.\" A parent who's interested in informing her- or himself would do well to buy books by both authors. Each author serves to illuminate the message of the other...i.e., different words, similarly great approach.This book is chock full of helpful tidbits. You won't regret reading it.\n\nAnswer:",

It's hilarious, has a great cast, powerful characters, and teenager dilemas. The movie is entitled \"Ghost World\", not only after a comic, but it means something. It pretty much means that everyone is progressively becoming the same person, and all that is left are the ghosts of the people that used to be. You can see how people get increasingly more similiar in the movie, and in real society as well. Plus, Thora Birch looks so much better with the extra 20 pounds she put on for the role.\n\nAnswer:",

Mercifully, it gathers momentum and becomes if not intriguing, certainly, not characterless or tedious.Slater, is suitable; Leto comes with a certain distance wholly appropriate for the part. Foriani (Julia) was capable enough for me to want to throttle her character...a very good sign I'd say.Clearly, the tempo was off, nonetheless, as the plot unfolded (for those of us who haven't read the book)'Basil' becomes more low-key melodrama and middle-end gothic, in very pleasing and agreeable way, as the threads of the narrative are sorted out.I was quite keen on 'Basil'.\n\nAnswer:",

From Anais Nin thru Margaret Mitchell, Ayn Rand, Hannah Arendt and 8 more women, this book sketches an unforgettable miniature of each and even dishes the dirt with elan.\n\nAnswer:",

I only have to say, who cares? The Star Wars movies are still great, and I'm sorry that a scene that lasts less than a minute is enough to make you get all angry and say \"But Han should have shot first!\" First off, it is a movie, and therefore it should be treated as such. Secondly, do you think George Lucas is doing this to please his fans? It's his universe so I think he can do what he wants with it. He always wanted Greedo to shoot first, so then when the SE's came out, he made him shoot first.Now, I haven't seen these movies yet (Of course, none of us SHOULD HAVE) but I'm still writing a review ahead of time because the movies will always be great. It is still the classic epics from the past and will remain to be classic epics in the future.\n\nAnswer:",

A handsome clever con man insinuates himself into the lives of many women - unfortunately one of them is going insane. If the plot had stayed with these women only, we might have had a great story, but the author put just too many characters and their story lines into this unsatisfying read. These secondary story lines take away from the main and we are bogged down with non-pertinent information.This book, as was the last one I read, \"The Birthday Present\" a let down.

When speaking to the neighbor proved unsuccessful, I felt that I needed to take matters into my own hands. I can stand on my deck and point to my neighbor's yard (about 50 ft away) and press the device.

Turning down shadows, cars, etc can help, but what's the fun in that??While the game and it's graphics and features are great, this is definitely another prime example of EA releasing a game before it's ready, and your game play will suffer because of it.

For many years there was one major player in the market but their cables sold for monster prices. However, Belkin came out with a premium audio-visual cable line, PureAV. I've spent a lot of time comparing these to that other major brand and am convinced the PureAV line provides a high quality product at an affordable price. My A/V components are connected to my 1080p LCD TV with PureAV cables, including HDMI, component video, and audio cables. Considering the tangle of cables behind my set, I feel confident that these cables are also well shielded from electro-magnetic interference.

I'm a 195 lb. man, and the weight of my feet was just too much for the unit to handle. I tried using the massager on just one foot at a time, as other users had recommended, but even this proved too great a burden for the machine to bear. The ball bearings on the massage plates are made of plastic, rather than steel. The drive mechanism is grossly underpowered, and simply not robust enough for its intended use. The motor slowed, then stopped altogether. It's ridiculous that anyone could actually charge money for this.We bought a Medirub after returning this. It costs much more, about $175, but it is still working years later, and it's an amazingly powerful and solid product. Another, and less costly alternative is the roller and porcupine ball, for about $12. It's portable, and handy when you're traveling. Both are available on Amazon.

But as he was featured in songs with 50 cent and others before this album dropped, his lyrical delivery style or flow seemed to have changed, almost to a wanna be tupac style, almost whiney at times. Practically the only song that has a good flow from eminem on encore is \"Mockingbird\". If this cd has flows like that with the same exact beats I would easily rate it with 4 stars. \"Mosh\" is clearly the best track, which has a good flow, good beat, and good focus. Other than that song it seems repetitive. His chorus' are weak and corny and last too long. He obviously still possesses the same lyrical skills but this isn't a cd that you can love almost any track on (like the previous 3). Overall, you can look at this as a good cd but compared to his previous efforts it is definitely weak in comparison...by far\n\nAnswer:",

I have it mounted at the top of my stairs to keep my dog from going down. My dog is extremely well-behaved, so any barrier will do, as he is not the type to push through. With persistence, a more aggressive pet or child might be able to get past this.I like the mounting brackets for the gate, as it actually allows for the gate to swing open and closed like a regular door, but plan to use your own fasteners to install the brackets. The gate also collapses, accordion style, but it's just a tad stiff, which will probably ease up with use.Another review noted the latch on the gate is a little difficult to open and close and it isn't the best, but for the price this gate is still a good value.\n\nAnswer:",

It concerns a serious of vicious attacks on gays in a particular neighborhood of London, presumably from real events. One is told that \"neighbors\" get together to fight back. Absolutely no such thing. Not one single attack is traced to its perpetrators. What one gets is a bunch of boring homophobic suburbanites having dinner while a gay boy gets murdered right outside. Kudos for having dared to expose the reality of sex between teens and adults. Many times, the teen is the aggressor, which was portrayed in the movie with chilling and heartbreaking accuracy. Wilby and Graves, of \"Maurice\" fame, are bit players in this one. Time has been kind to Graves, not Wilby. The movie belongs to the teen and his adult target. Real chemistry there!

This tower certainly is not on par with Wade's Cat Furniture (I have 2) but better than the ones in Petsmart/Petco. I got it for our two large Maine Coons. The color was not as shown. A little disappointed there. The one I got is more of a tan color. I'll keep it only because the hassle of returning this is not worth it. Maybe it will show less cat hair! Aside from the color, it appears to be pretty sturdy. The Coons climbed it and scratched on it right away. It wobbled a tiny bit but was far from tipping over when they jumped on it. Would I buy another one? No. I'll stick with Wade's or Arubacat.\n\nAnswer:",

I couldn't stop watching it. So when I became an Amazon member a few weeks ago, I remembered the movie and wondered if a novelization was available. Lucky for me, Amazon had it and for such a good price.MacGregor did a spectacular job putting the screenplay into novel-form. As I read on, I remembered all the scenes, all the lines, all the amazing acting done by the cast.

DeBecker writes with apparent authority on the subject and the books use of several case studies truly help the reader understand what type of mind one is dealing with in a self-defense situation against these sick minded whack jobs. I recommend the book to all my students of self-defense, regardless of their gender or age. Further, I suggest that my martial art and police students read it. The book serves as a great foundation of knowledge for those sincerely interested in self-defense and self-reliance. The pre-attack indicators are an excellent tool for avoiding and attempting to prevent personal danger. This book along with some good physical techniques of self-defense should be mandatory for all teenage girls prior to leaving home for college or work. For those of you who are serious about self-reliance and self-protection may I refer you to my \"Listmania\" suggestions.\n\nAnswer:",

I taught a recent course on feminism and politics using Lorber as my main theoretical text, but found that its definitions of the different kinds of feminism were analytically muddled. Rather than clarifying differences between Marxist, liberal, postmodern and other feminisms, the descriptions blurred the distinctions and failed to emphasize the ways in which liberal feminism has been challenged on different and sometimes competing grounds by the alternatives. The result may reflect reality--feminism has become an eclectic mix of ideas--but the lack of clarity about how each type emerged and why makes the book less than helpful as a basis on which to build a course. I have great respect for Judith Lorber, but was very frustrated by this book.\n\nAnswer:",

Checking the Mattel web site found that they do not sell them online but list a fair price for the MSRP. However, buying online the price seems to be more than double the MSRP when you include shipping and handling.

I use these headphones when I,m working and I have to look down a lot. The over the top of the head type band always fell forward even when I made them as tight as I could so a behind the head type band was the logical step to correct that fault.The RP-HG10 falls short in that even though it has the \"XBS\" extra bass system that the RP-HT21s do they do not have the same level of bass. The RP-HG10 bass is almost not there even when I turn the bass all the way up. The RP-HT21 had no such problem.Even though the RP-HG10 fall flat when it comes to bass the rest of the audio spectrum seems slightly above average.\n\nAnswer:",

Great programs, no signal fade, very enjoyable. The Roady 2, however, is a pain in the butt. Be prepared to have wires running everywhere in a tangled mess. In addition, the screen is too small for using while driving. I suggest you use the tape adapter (another wire! ) because there is always a local station interfering with the Roady's broadcast.

Yes this book was well written, and yes the program samples were nicely layed out, but the whole scheme was not a practicle learning tool. The majority of the internet protocols were handled by the demo ocx called dssock32.ocx. I did not see any code of this ocx, well perhpas bits and chunks but nothing that could be of use. This book showed how to become reliant on someone elses hard work without giving you, the programmer, the ability to create your own internet applications. I would suggest this book to everyone if they are looking for a well written book that lacks in practicalities in the programming world.\n\nAnswer:",

Penn is as good as everyone has said; most of the time, due to his acting, I felt like I was watching a documentary. Unfortunately, a documentary would probably be more interesting than the film. It draaaaagged in spots and was mostly just unremarkable. Giving away the ending up front didn't make any sense, and while the building of the movement was fun and interesting in spots, a bit more attention to the assassination would have been nice (or at least have it played for shock). Some bits were fun, some bits were informative (e.g. the actual footage of gay bars around the U.S. being raided was pretty interesting), some touching...but mostly it's not something I'd recommend. I think they should have cut some of his relationships out for example, I don't know, just get it a bit more brisk would be nice.\n\nAnswer:",

I feel the same frustration and worry she does, but this book just didn't do it for me. The author simply tried too hard to write like a teen would, in my opinion. The recent pop culture references fell flat, especially considering that most of them relate to 'flash-in-the-pan' fads.The cliques came off as over-exaggerated. Of course there are cliques and groups at my high school, but none are so blatantly obvious and territorial as these.The characters were often extremely annoying to me, as well, especially Jessica. She came off as too self-righteous, passing off almost everything and everyone as a waste of her time.All in all, I thought this book was okay. It can be hard to find a good book for my age group, so this one will do.

An example from the chapter on resumes: \"You know your resume is ready when your mother looks at it and can't recognize who it is.\" Buy this book and enjoy!\n\nAnswer:",

Finally, the movie would have been more credible if George Clooney had been fired in the end, after his associates' \"Go To Meeting\" Internet no-travel approach had been institutionalized. At least she had the sense to move on with her life, leaving Clooney to return to being a lonely drag on society. I can't believe this movie is being considered for an award!\n\nAnswer:",

I can't possibly say enough about how the quality of this show surpasses every drama on television today. Forget that it's sci-fi. That's barely a factor here. It's about human life and how we value the complex strands that connect us to one another and other life.What's really insulting is that Universal has the gall to release the first half of this season for the price of a full season worth of shows. Sure, it's on sale now. HOWEVER, the fact that they feel they are justified in charging you $49.99 for less than 10 hours worth of scripted programming is ghastly. I'd give this set a solid \"5\".

I can now say how disappointed I am. While Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, and the rest of this cast are all solid, the story, and especially the way it is delivered both takes forever to develop and frustrates.The dialogue takes forever for the actors to say, and I often felt like if I made hand gestures, it might help to speed up the story out of their mouths.Certain aspects of the story, characters, and entire scenes serve no purpose at all in this film, other than to elongate it.However, as for the now-famous orgy scene, it is certainly one of the most fascinating and bizarre sequences in recent film.I can't help but feel sorry for the cast and crew, who, while they put forth such a strong effort, end up in such a mess.\n\nAnswer:",

My daughter (seven years old) really loves it. She's read all the books, as have I. This movie really is a few stories from many of the books combined to make one story, but in my opinion, it works.Most of the characters are great, especially Rowley and Roderick. They're both robust, well written, and steal the scenes they are in. Steve Zahn is ok as the Dad, but halfway through the movie he turns orange. Seriously... it's like he overdosed on spray tan. Very distracting. I wish they had left out the 'Angie' part, however. She's a HORRIBLE actress, and she looks like she's about 20. Her character gave me the creeps and I felt like they were trying WAY too hard to fulfill the role of 'deep' girl.Other than that, I look forward to the next Wimpy Kid movie!\n\nAnswer:",

I also wondered why she used a fictitious name for the town she grew up in? All the surrounding areas kept their names and caused me confusion in the beginning of where is this action all taking place anyway? Apparently, the used book I received from Amazon from another reader felt the same.

For instance, if none of their albums weren't ALREADY available and they were just now releasing them on Disc. But since the \"KISS\" albums for the most part were already re-mastered way back in '97 up to \"Crazy Crazy Night's\" anyway, there really wasn't any need for this box set save for the re-master of \"Alive 3\" & the unreleased \"Millennium\" concert. Just another part of the M-O-N-E-Y game, the all mighty dollar. Sure, this is a great place to start, if you're just getting into KISS, but who didn't already have everything in this box set except the \"Millennium\" concert? If they'd just finished re-mastering the catalog where they left off at and released the \"Millennium\" show separate, that would have saved alot of people some Money and also we would have had the rest of the albums re-mastered.\n\nAnswer:",

You will be challenged to ensure that you have a well-defined evangelistic strategy with a clearly-known pupose. If you're a church leader, I know you'll agree - \"There is always room for improvement\". Do you want to be challenged? Do you want your creativity and motivation for reaching the lost, kicked up a few notches? Then get a copy of this thought provoking book.

The readings on the HEM-609 are always low (which would be nice if my BP were that low), but when they are compared to the readings in the doctor's office they are unsatisfactory. As a result, I bought another old-fashioned \"hand-pump, read the dial with a stethoscope\" monitor, and that's what I use since it agrees very closely with the doc's office.I do not know if this problem (reading about 20mm low) is due to my wrist size (7.25\") or the individual unit I have or ???.

First off, $50 for this is a heck of a bargain. It's a good hose with a very capable reel, and about 4' of connecting hose you can run to the spigot. It connects to the spigot via a quick release valve, which both makes it a cinch to hook up, and easy to move around if you have extra quick-releases.The reel mechanism is solid, and I have no complaints so far.

Author Nathaniel Branden notes that the greatest barrier to love is the fear that we are unlovable - which is why self-esteem is so critical.He describes self-esteem as the combination of self-confidence and self-respect. The former pertains to competence and the latter pertains to personal worth.To generate positive self-esteem, Branden suggests making a commitment to awareness (a commitment to thinking as a way of life). He says independent thinking about our work, relationships and values will guide our life, and thus enhance our self-esteem. He also emphasizes the importance of integrity, self-responsibility and self-acceptance in building self-esteem.For anyone looking to enhance their self-esteem, or to raise children with high self-esteem, this is a \"must have\" book.\n\nAnswer:",

I remember hearing this for the first time on Eight Track in the early 80's, and after searching for 15 odd years I finally was able to find the album. \"Temporary Secretary\" is odd, but fun. Waterfalls, I will agree, sounds like TLC completely lifted the lyrics from Sir Paul (hey, didn't George Harrison get sued for something like this??

Jack Nietzsche (Cassavetes) investigates fraudulent claims. For example he peeps into the window of a hottie in a wheel chair who actually has no problem moving around when no one's looking.

Cassavetes who's now into directing (\"Notebook\", \"Alpha Dog\") made the right move. It's definitely worth mentioning his co-star, Deborah Shelton a former Miss USA/Texas who does the full monty several times. Also Miles O'Keeffe (remember Tarzan with Bo Derek?) and Richard Roundtree (original \"Shaft\") have roles. The movie is terrible except the sex scenes which are particularly good for this genre.

My typical pizza is a Tombstone Brick Oven Style Cheese Pizza topped with half a can of drained, petite diced Red Gold brand tomatoes. The tomatoes add extra cooking time. I have to let the top get really brown in order to get a crispy crust. If I pull the pizza out when it looks done, the crust is soggy.This is not caused by the addition of the tomatoes (that only increases the cooking time). If I don't add any topping, I still have to overcook the top to get a crispy crust. In our conventional oven, the pizza is thoroughly and evenly cooked. The Cuisinart doesn't do that for me.If you don't mind a softer crust, the Cuisinart does its job well. But if you want a nice crispy crust, you'll probably have to stick with your conventional oven.\n\nAnswer:",

I fully agree with the previous other reviewers. In addition to more highlight the video, I'd like to say that each movement is repeated 4 times but not just \"copy-paste\" the same sequence, it is really performed 4 different times so that you can notice small differences in different part of the movement that help you to better understand the movement itself. What I also really appreciate is the fact the movements are shown in both front and back view. This is great since the back view puts you in the same condition as in a class (back to the teacher) without haveing the mirror problem. The only point is that I'd have appreciated some application of the movement.In conclusion the video really puts you as in a class.

It appears to be a cut-and-paste job of previous accounts. Worst of all, it repeats the falsehood that Douglas MacArthur deliberately disobeyed President Hoover in crossing the Anacostia bridge during the climactic end of the Bonus Army on July 28, 1932.Historians have long known better. See for example, Perret's \"Old Soldiers Never Die\" (Random House 1996)The story of the Bonus Army was an interesting event in the Depression era- combining the confused politics and economics of that time with nearly unprecedented societal anxieties.

The book is more about the operation than the politics (although that is covered as well). You really feel like you are on the ground with these guys. I've watched the movie a million times, but the book blows it away. The movie does a great job of following the book - but there are just so many more details in the book and the context much more robust. I found it a little confusing figuring out where they teams were at. There are some maps in the book, but I still got confused - but I get lost in my own house.

The band sounds relaxed and confident as they stretch out and explore a whole bunch of different sounds and styles. I've only had the record for about 4 hours now, so perhaps its still early for judgement. Certainly it jumps out of the box and is probably more immediate and party-oriented than its predecessor (the more somber, but infinitely-wonderful \"The Question\", which is probably my favorite record - ska or otherwise - of the last five years).

The story's iffy, Jamie Foxx's character's cockiness clouded his judgment (he selects missiles in a situation that really required guns, and pays for it dearly), and I really felt the jets' cockpits needed a severe redesign, such as improved canopy visibility. However, the visuals are spectacular and gives the technothriller junkies out there some new toys to chew on, such as the Talon jets (based on the Northrop Grumman Switchblade design), the AGM-2 Truncheon implosion bomb (the ultimate surgical weapon, as it can cause a building to collapse on itself without any real collateral damage), and the Camel Hump inflight refueling blimp.

I think there was a blatant lack of anything that resembles conclusion in \"Silent Blade\", and Drizzt (previously one of my favorite characters) whines more than ever. I did like the angle with Wulfgar, and hopefully we will see more installments on this (although I thought it was absolutely ridiculous that he was brought back from the dead in \"Passage to Dawn\"). Also, it was cool to see Jarlaxle and Entreri working in concert in Calimport.The book was captivating as with all Salvatore's works, but too open ended.

This feature can be a nuisance at times.This phone does not have a button to turn the ringer off. The volume of the handset can only be adjusted slightly.

I picked it up chiefly due to a reference Scorsese makes to it in A Personal Journey. Certainly, Divorce Italian Style is a farce but the emotions and events it contains are ones with which all of us can relate--even though none of us have a need for a Italian \"divorce.\" One also can appreciate the mystique which European films had--as compared to the more stodgy state of American cinema--during that period. I've always loved Marcello Mastroianni and his efforts here are outstanding. He plays his role perfectly and is a figure of both contempt and admiration. All of the acting, however, is great. The plot unwinds slowly but does not end predictably (on the whole). The climax is nuanced and the last frame tells us much about the nature of men and women.\n\nAnswer:",

I ordered a couple of books for flash including this one. I though this would provide more detailed GRAPHICS and interactivity after the basics were learned. I opened this book, I then opened the Foundation in flash book, then proceeded to put this one away for future exploration. The Foundation in flash book was great, an ongoing project in each chapter to develop a flash site, tons of pictures and step by step instructions..etc.. I came back to this book and was amazed at how different, dull, and General it was. There really was no Special Graphics or interactivity here. The Foundation of flash book had more examples of actionscript and interactivity than this. So if your looking to learn flash, don't get this. If you want a reference book on basic flash with a little bit of actionscript that you want to keep in a dark closet to read again \"Just Incase\" you missed something, then, well this book is for you.\n\nAnswer:",

I haven't exactly dunked the watch in a sink of water either, but for some reason the crispness of that button press is gone and now I have to try a few times whenever I want to get it to work.The heart rate sensor chest strap isn't too comfortable either, and it does take a little time with the manual to figure out. However, if it wasn't for the start button sticking, I'd still give this watch a good review simply because the features are great.

If you have read the book, you will be very disappointed.I realize that a film can't replicate a book, but it should at least have an understandable plot and make it clear how the characters fit into that plot. This film fails on both counts. Scenes flash by so fast you barely have a chance to grasp what's going on. Characters appear out of nowhere; you have no idea who they are.Too bad, because this is one of James Lee Burke's most dramatic books--Dave falls off the wagon when his wife dies.

Of course it's easy to look back in time and say, \"they should have done this\" or \"shouldn't have done that\". These were very poor people to begin with, they saw a market hungry for their output and a government anxious to encourage their production. Contour plowing and turning under the topsoil were not issues they would have been concerned with in the environment they labored. In fact, the solutions from FDR did not reverse the problems which even Egan admits still exist. This is a very well-written, and well-researched book despite Egan's rush to judgement.\n\nAnswer:",

I know Cuomo has often said that he sacrificed the lyrics in order to make better melodies, but the melodies are not THAT good, not enough to justify the lyrics.It is a great album though, much closer to the sound of the debut \"Blue Album\". Very short pop tunes. That's it. So when taken at that angle, it's an excellent record. Is it as good as Pinkerton? No. If you are looking for innovation turn to The Rentals \"Seven More Minutes\" or Nada Surf's \"Proximity Effect\". This is a pure pop record, all fun, no frills.\n\nAnswer:",

Box is talented, but his first novel, *Open Season*, was short on the craft and skill that make first-rate reading. *Savage Run* shows him more in control of his story, and it takes us from a promising beginning to writing worthy of seasoned pros like Nevada Barr and Kirk Mitchell.The plot is in the editorial reviews: Apparently, there is a pogrom against environmentalists, and Box's hero, Joe Pickett, gets drawn into the action. Box weaves together environment and Wyoming history to tell his story. You will know who the villain is early on, but Box manages some good surprises nonetheless.The only quibble I have with the books is one I've seen elsewhere. Pickett is just a bit too self-effacing. A series is hard to sustain when the hero is more a victim and observer than agent of change and discovery. It's time to see Pickett grow some confidence to go with his Jimmy Stewart goodness.\n\nAnswer:",

One other thing I didn't like was the fact that the words she used were dull and hard to understand.

How many more times has he predicted it since then? has it? Where ole Hal is conscerned meditate on Matt 7:21-22, Mark 13:22,1 John 4:1 etc. This is a teaching popular among Evangelical Protestants and asserts that Christians will be miraculaously delivered from the tribulation and that only the \"unsaved\" will suffer under the rule of the Antichrist. The idea that Christians will be \"raptured\"-that is, taken up into heaven-before the tribulation is an invention of the ninteenth century. No one in the previous 1800 yrs. of Christian history ever came up with such a notion...Anyone that likes a book like this needs to read (Matthew 25:13)\n\nAnswer:",

My only complaint was some (in my opinion) unnecessary foul language. I am not easily offended and that isn't my objection. It just seemed jarring in the context of a serious, yet entertaining, self-help book to have 4-letter words sprinkled throughout for no apparent reason. For me, this really detracted from its message.I'm not talking about graphic sex or anything like that - primarily exclamations, as in: \"Oh xxxxx!\" If you will be totally distracted or offended by this, then pick a different book.

After a few days on this diet, I felt like I was going to pass out and I wanted to punch someone else out. I was irritable, crabby, weird, shaky, nervous and weak. This is one of the worst diets I've ever tried, it may have helped some but I suspect their improvement is due to eating better foods in general and getting more exercise.

One of the most recognizable voices in 20th Century pop culture, old-school folkie Burl Ives recorded prolifically in the 1950s and '60s, but it's Christmas music he'll really be remembered for... This disc collects fifteen fine examples of his Decca Records holiday material, taken from a variety of sources... Most tracks feature prominent pop-orchestral arrangements, but Burl's rolling, grandfatherly tones cut right through the cheese every time & cheerfully draw you in. As old-fashioned Christmas material goes, this is pretty hard to beat.\n\nAnswer:",

Our imagination will be nowhere. Censorship of books is much like destroying our thoughts and leaving us nowhere. In many schools today, The Giver, a book by Lois Lowry, has been banned. In this novel, there is apparently, censorship in the society. Even though you may think that this book is nothing like reality, it really is. We censor things like their community does. We don't want our nation to see certain things and neither does the community in The Giver. This censorship may be for better, possibly for the worse. We will never know some things because of censorship. Some things are better left unsaid. This is the reason we censor books even though some minds may be yearning to know these things. Burning books is one way to censor things and telling people not to read is another.\n\nAnswer:",

But, after 28 days of 'forcing ourselves' to use it, we returned it to Target.I wish I could give it a higher rating because it has sooooo many positive features BUT the reception was horrible!!! 95% of our using it was done inside our house. When talking on the phone the incoming voice would fade in and out (no matter what we tried to change it) or the connection would be crackling. When we would listen to recorded messages they were the same or extremely garbled. We had other family members and friends try it while visiting and they had the same experience.We purchased the AT-T E2600B Cordless Answering Machine System with 2 cordless handsets, each having speakerphones in handsets and base.

It ignores your movements for the first few beeps, so you can't accidentally oversleep by moving around unintentionally.+ Sets itself! True, this doesn't set itself to the atomic clock, but the battery backup keeps you on time during power outages (the alarm still sounds even when on battery backup).+ Monday thru Friday alarms: I always forgot to set my alarm Sunday evenings, and forgot to turn it off Friday evenings. Now, I don't have to worry being late Monday or waking up too early on Saturday.+ Dual Alarms: Have one setting for Monday-Friday, and another one for the weekend!

With \"The Breed\" he does bring out some scary options for the typical characters he has. In this movie they are of course just a bunch of college students on some vacation getaway on an island that formerly housed some secret government test facility that experimented with dogs.It has the usual problem presented which has the youths trying to figure out a plan of escape as well as at times, a plan of attack. In the end I just felt like this movie was sub standard slash that did not have enough staying power to make me feel like it had any value to be viewed again. Craven needs to concentrate on getting more intricate scripts that are followed up by some better actors, but that costs more money so I am not expecting anything spectacular from him anytime soon.\n\nAnswer:",

There is no middle ground for those who view this film.As the many reviews suggest, there is stark division between those who are deeply moved by the love Christ showed for mankind by enduring His Passion, and those who make a mockery of it: just like those who surrounded Jesus as He hung on the cross. Jesus prophecied that \"When I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto myself.\" This is certainly true: \"all men,\" those who seek to comfort Christ in His profound, redemptive suffering; and those who choose only to intensify it.I am deeply grateful for the honest, Roman Catholic witness of this film to the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the God-Man. We all, wittingly or unwittingly, take our side as the result of witnessing Christ's crucifixion.

Normally, i wouldn't have gotten soundtracks just because of the trailer. That music isnt necessarily in the soundtrack and can be a bit misleading sometimes. But, i went on the website and the music playing at the website was the music from the trailer, so I thought, it has to be in the soundtrack. Well, it isnt. Most of the soundtrack sounds too soft, too much the same and it doesn't have a particular melody to it. I give it a 3 because some of the music is good. And hey, you have to give it to Josh Groban for singing Remember so beautifully.\n\nAnswer:",

Duchovny's character is quite common over here and it's best to take them with a good laugh. Underneath all this broken up, f.cked up image he depicts, there is a little lost boy. But, as in life, not everybody can be saved. I think this show is very funny, finally an intelligent adult series. I hate all these cleaned up versions of happy-go-lucky soap operas, where nobody ever uses a bad word, nor takes a serious gulp of whiskey or even has some steamy sex. Well this is more like it. Life isn't at all like Gilmore-Girls and why not tell about it? I hope the show will carry on for some time, I'd love to see all the characters develop. And as I am on the subject, I am not all too sure about that sex-addiction thing of Mr. Duchovny. Maybe it is just a publicity stunt. Well, I don't care, as long as he keeps on doing this fine work.\n\nAnswer:",

There are parts that are extremely entertaining, but then it slows down and I found myself skimming the pages to get through it.I really like Harriet, though. I wound up getting really wrapped up in her and caring mostly about her more than the other characters.And I was extremely disappointed with the ending.

There was no weather condition or style of use that could have caused this (I used it on grass in a quiet, ordinary park), only workmanship defects. The binding is not compatible with the mat itself and now I expect fraying and further separation.

As a fellow expat that lived as an Expat, I could relate to Ms.Hager's experiences. However what struck me was her consistent faintly condesending way of describing her interactions with her friends, specifically her 'dear' Japanese friends. Here is one of her many dispariging remarks: 'If you have a chance, ask a Japanese to pronounce Mark McGuire'', writes Ms. Hager, after hearing one of her dear friends excitedly describing her sighting of this famous baseball player. I have many more examples, but will leave it at that. Enough said. What could have been a rather interesting memoir, instead, turned this New England reader OFF. Shame on you.\n\nAnswer:",

Though the general theme of the book became clear about midway, most of the fact presentations were disjointed and unclear. When the author switches to a little bit of what might be considered poetry, towards the end of the book, the reader is tossed into confusion. The author really should have considered the fact that most readers are not MIND-readers and could not possibly decipher the hidden meanings behind some of the passages.

I started listening to Dido when she did the song with Eminem, but I was more interested in her song than the rap that Eminem did (hailing from detroit, I must give props on Eminem on a song that with less airplay might have actually carried some meaning) but anyways, I listened to the rest of the album and realized that \"thank you\" was really only the tip of the iceberg. She is very talented and spending the $12.00 is well worth it if you remotely like what you have heard on the radio.As one very famous quote goes \"Good music is what you like\".

We get to listen in as he struggles to figure out his feelings and actions. Luther is a philosopher and he has a philosophical way of looking at almost everything. Some of the things he thinks are downright funny.His friend Sparky is always thinking of ways to make money. These ideas put Luther in some humorous situations and in one almost serious trouble.Sparky thinks Luther has it made because Luther has a job and his mother is a big time landlord who makes lots of money. But Luther is slowly facing the truth about his mother and her business.The humor in this story almost conceals its difficult coming-of-age situation. The more Luther's story unfolds, all its ugly realities begin to show themselves and forces our hero to see things as they really are not as he hoped they would be.This is a funny story but a not so funny Sarge!\n\nAnswer:",

In life is impossible to avoid conflict and regardless of the location of the planet where you live you will find it. So here the couple feel that their existence is boring and meaningless, but if we look closer the reason for their drama, it is never really brought to life by the author. It does not seem to me that she wants to denounce anything in particular about human experience in suburbia, or to open the mind of the reader to issues that somehow live hidden before our daily lives. The burning of the house is an empty act that leads nowhere. To some degree it was not even necessary for the development of the story. Nothing in the book rings true, and that is the problem, the book might be fun to read but it fails to move you or to provide any type of insight.

It is a nice model.But reading this book as a layman was downright painful. His writing has absolutely no elegance to it.

This was a great documentary that indulged in undeserved demonization of republicans and glorification of democrats. The conclusion advocates a communist redistribution of wealth. The national debt is frightening and overwhelming, but more government spending in a different direction is only escalating the problem! It should have included what happened in the 1920s leading up to the market crash and the Great Depression, so that people could get an idea of the end game possibilities here, rather than promoting a defunct political theory.\n\nAnswer:",

The writing is fair and while the story line works for the first part of the book one soon realizes that many plot points are really for an upcoming book. As this was a first novel by this author I thought that it would stand on it's own but ***SPOILER*** when I got to the end I was right in my suspicion that this was all set up for a second book. I love series and don't have a problem with plot points scattered as seeds for upcoming works but usually those books stand on their own and have a conclusion on their own. After the first part (noted as such), it's all set up for the sequel. When I don't race to finish a book but feel that \"I might as well since I'm half way through\" it's not a good sign.\n\nAnswer:",

(Oddly enough it does not taste at all like papaya.) This makes the sauce much less acidic, and less vinegary. However, the sauce still packs a punch of hotness. This sauce is excellent on quiche, scrambled eggs, baked chicken, rice, fish, pork, hamburgers, or steak. I also use it in chili; it gives the chili a nice heat and flavor without adding the acidic hot pepper taste. We have been using this sauce in our house for over three decades and would be hard pressed to replace it with another.

After all, I have the movies on DVD, and my Blu-Ray player does a great job of upscaling, so the Blu-Ray version is not strictly necessary for me. That said, the Blu-Ray is just a better all-around experience given the choice. The price seems alright for this set, but I did better, thus the 4-star rating and not 5. Instead of ordering this box set, I went to the UK Amazon website and bought it there (amazon.co.uk) for about half the price. An excellent option, considering I got all 8 movies and additional special feature content for around $45 (and region-free discs).\n\nAnswer:",

It doesn't even have the song that's playing when Vince and Brian get in that fight in the beginning of the movie, and that's the entire reason I bought the CD!

The stuffing consists of a thin rectangle of foam surrounded by a softer dense foam which feels like semi-dried latex chalking.

The book is profusely illustrated and highlights the careers of each jeweler/artist. The inclusion of period photos is an added bonus and hints of the artists' individual personalities.

Or, better yet, not purchase it AT ALL and then tape it from tv re-runs.One personal opinion and/or suggestion to reviewer \"Kim Possible Finicatata \"Jen\"\".

He also wrote another series under this name featuring a film scout. This character is a young punkish girl named Rune who is trying to get through her 20's and survive NYC. She is currently working at a video store and when a regular dies under suspiciouscircumstances she becomes interested in the movie he rented numerous times. She becomes obsessed with plot of the movie as it is based loosely on a true crime. She thinks she can solve the case find the money and live happily ever after. This plot is hard to follow at times and sometimes I don't think the author is aware of what he wants the characters to do. I have read his later books and know he can write a good thriller. Too bad this book falls flat, I believe his publisher re-released to capitalize on his famous status. I will read more of the scout series and might try the next one in this series just because Rune is such a likable character.\n\nAnswer:",

Unlike his discovery, Bill Cosby, Allan Sherman is all but forgotten by everyone except his many diehard fans. And that's a shame, for, in his own way, his was as great a talent as Cosby's. And, on a personal note, whenever I want a good laugh, this CD gets me going every time. Yes, \"Hello Muddah\" is here, as it should be. But so is \"Sarah Jackman\" (supposedly a favorite of JFK), \"Lotsa Luck,\" \"Al 'n' Yetta,\" \"Good Advice,\" \"Crazy Downtown,\" and \"Schticks of One and a Half Dozen of the Other,\" all of them comic gems. Steve Allan's liner notes are merely the icing on the cake. In short, this is a funny tribute to a very funny man who left us too soon. Camp Grenada forever!\n\nAnswer:",

Was it going to be a blatant [take on] of Mono or Cocteau Twins? Well, it turned out that \"Roulette\" sounded like neither. Violet Indiana is an entity of its own. I'll admit I wasn't sure what to make of \"Roulette\" while listening to the first track \"Air Kissing\". Luckily I had nothing to worry when \"Air Kissing\" segued into \"Busted\", the second track of the album. In the grand tradition of trip hop music, the music is light and airy with the delicate vocals of Siobhan De Mare. The music itself isn't really innovating to be honest but I enjoyed the duo's debut album.\n\nAnswer:",

This is an excellent collection of out-takes, and material recorded just prior to the line-up change that precipated the \"Too Much Guitar\" album.

Braff is one of the best mainstream players still around today who, while not a big force in the swing band era, was obviously influenced by it or at least by Bobby Hackett if no one else. I actually don't know much about Larkins but on this CD they complement each other very well and lay down some beautiful interpretations of these standards. Braff prefers the darker sound of the cornet (vs. trumpet) and Larkin's uncomplicated style provides a perfect river for Braff to navigate with interesting solos but ones that (fortunately) never stray too far from the original melody. Very nice stuff, easy to listen to but not \"easy listening\". If you like Bobby Hackett or Warren Vache you'll enjoy this recording.\n\nAnswer:",

It is a great improvement over the Stanley Board Bender, because it locks in place, reducing our manpower needed. The problem stems from the soft metal that makes up the BoWrench.

That was a great success, except that the pieces that lock the head in place eventually started to slip. We reversed them and they worked a while more.

Abraham Lincoln supported a move to draft Confederate prisoners of war languishing (and often starving) in Northern prisons, with the stipulation that they would not have to go South and fight fellow Confederates. The \"Galvanized Yankees\" (so named because it was thought that their loyalty to the North was only a thin \"ganvanized\" layer) -- 6,000 of them, took the oath of loyalty to the Union and headed West to guard stagecoaches and mail routes. Numerous fights with Plains Indians, bitter cold, at lonely outposts were but a few of the hazards the Galvanized Yankees faced. My gg grandfather survived all this and returned home in 1866. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning more about these brave men who chose service to the Union rather than almost certain death in Northern prisons.\n\nAnswer:",

At the time, there weren't many books with female leads that weren't over-effeminate, which is fine; but it can get tiring. I came across this book again years later and I still love it. The suspense builds right from the beginning as Jessie states some of the peculiar behavior among the town's residents. You will not be able to put this book down as Jessie must find help for her neighbors while eluding the grasp of those who want to keep her quiet. The ending was good in that it was realistic, even if it sort of fizzles out instead of wrapping everything up and leaving nothing to the imagination. Highly recommended for younger readers (grades 3-6) in that it gives many opportunities for discussion and 'What if' questions.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, he discribes their maneuvers as \"marches\" where in fact the 9th and 10th must have ridden as they were, after all, mounted soldiers.The biggest fault, in my opinion, is the very ending.

However the storyline is totally unconventional, filled with her daydreaming depicted in very original and fun ways, and with unexpected turns as she goes about her good deeds. At one point she finds herself caught in pursuing what's best for others, while being afraid to pursue happiness for herself.In times of uncertainty and was such as these, where everyone is in dire need of a positive message, this movie is it.

I bought this several months ago so I am sorry I can't tell you exactly what the difference is.What I can tell you is is that the new foil cuts much closer. So much so that I swapped them a few times to be sure, maybe it was the older one was worn but still I noticed it right away and hadn't before when replacing older foils.The other difference was that I was unable to get the new foil to work with the cleaning system until I moved it around in the cleaner a bit. Also, when I removed the razor from the cleaner it had taken some of the finish off of the razor up by the foil. Not that I care about that or that the foil is a different color, its the results that count and I will continue to use the 7000's\n\nAnswer:",

I actually purchased this sword to be ready when I started learning the nam dao techniques from my sifu, but when that time came, I ended up using a Katana instead because the nam do was just not good for training. It MAY be good for performance, so that if anyone wants to train for a show this could be a good sword.The s-shaped guard is loose, it shakes when the sword moves. I treat my training tools and weapons with respect (if that even makes sense lol), but in regards to this item, it is neither a weapon or a training tool, so it stays piled under junk on my floor, the same place it's been since a week or so after I got it.\n\nAnswer:",

Judge this book by its cover, but be forewarned. These authors are just having a good time. You won't find a copy of The Stand hidden between pages 40 and 65. Amy Bender might have written more than Michael Crichton, and Rick Moody isn't locked into his usual breed of psychological realism. If you are looking for an explanation of the soul, rife with semantic theory and cryptic allusions to history, go pick up the latest by Umberto Eco.

In some places the level of darkness and number of symbolic artifacts seems to edge into self-parody.The basic story is very weak -- Batman walks about the asylum beating up his old enemies. The real emphasis is on how these villians illustrate parts of Batman's character. Personally, I found this less than convincing.Part of the problem for me is that I have a very low tolerance for paedophilia and torture, and much prefer detection-based Batman stories (such as The Long Halloween).\n\nAnswer:",

His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland.\n\nAnswer:",

Having a small yard, I estimate I ran the machine a maximum of 25 hours. This past winter, it began making an awful racket and refused to run anymore. Upon examination, I found the motor shaft turns in a sleeve bearing. How CHEAP AND JUNKY!!!!!! The sleeve bearing nearest the spinner head had worn considerably, allowing such a wobble as to destroy the motor. I did like shredding the leaves, as they make good mulch for the garden. However, it was a real pain to use. Even the smallest oak twigs could break the line. The funnel never fit together very well. The stand was flimsy and the knobs would not stay tightened. With some improvements, such as high quality motor bearings and the ability to use larger cutting line,Flowtron would have a great product. Unfortunately, after years of people complaining, the company has not seen fit to engineer any improvements into the product.\n\nAnswer:",

There is no doubt that Emma Shapplin can't sing, it is just that the music is blan and uncaptivating. Every song sounds like the other, and all of the songs are dull, no gems on this one. Her voice sometimes seems not to be flowing with the music, and it seems as if she is being held back from really displaying her talent. The music also doesn't flow, and it seems as if the musicians can't decide what tune to play next. The whole album is substanceless and the songs aimless. Still, I have just purchased her other ablum, because believe she has the talent to create an album as good as Sarah Brightman's, so I've given her a second chance.

I like it well enough but it could be so much better. I don't like the flimsy wire they used to connect it to the phone! I am afraid that I am going to pull too hard on it and it will break. Also, I have the in-line volume all the way up and the sound is still too low for me. I will update this review after I have used it for a while longer. But I am looking for a different one. I don't recommend this headset.\n\nAnswer:",

It worked wonderfully- I could juice hard veggies and leafy greens if I wadded them up. It was also relatively easy to clean up- the only difficulty getting the spout clean. Now, all was fine and dandy until one day it suddenly wouldn't turn on anymore. There had never been an indication of a motor problem or issues, just one day, it would no longer turn on at all even after I checked different outlets. And of course this happened about a month after the warranty went up.While this juicer may be a good price and a product that works well for a period of time it certainly doesn't seem to last well!\n\nAnswer:",

He even goes to the extreme of discounting a story about his concern over his height exceeding the max requirement for space travel. I found many parts of this book enjoyable, but left feeling I had only been reading a whitewashed version purified for mass consumption. On slight hint at the \"real\" John Glenn may be revealed in his writing a letter to NASA in an effort to overturn the decision to have Alan Shepard and Guss Grissom fly in space before him. This book left me with many more questions about the real man. Showing more of his human, occassionally risking and failing side would have added much to my enjoyment.

The band plays simple music compared to JA; however, not to be dismissed by any means. The GS has cool melodic mesmerizing songs that are reminisent of a time gone by, like no other. Before the coke, before the smack, before the hard drugs. Yes, it was a softer sweeter parade. The time when I was a teenybopper, life was simple, the cool groovy people were together and loved one another. The Eastern influence of the Slick brothers I really dig.

It was so much easier than making the brine for the freezing process. My only disappointment is that mine broke in less than a year. I always kept the bowl in the freezer and my guess is that something bumped one of the tabs on the bowl and cracked it. I didn't find out until I was making a batch and blue liquid slowly started appearing at the base of the bowl. As the bowl thawed so that I could wash it the freezing liquid kept running out more and more. The receipt and box are long gone (I've never had an issue with a Kitchen Aid product before), but I'm not going to get another. Instead I'm opting for something that doesn't have a weak point like this bowl does. Maybe a rework of the design would help as well, after all it was a very awkward shape to fit in the freezer.\n\nAnswer:",

We took the table apart, flipped the shelves over, and put it back together, but within about a month the shelves slipped out again. I keep as little as possible on the shelves to be able to change the baby's diapers, but have no idea how long these shelves will last before being completely unusable. I am very disappointed, but am not even sure what I would do if I had to purchase a changing table all over again because there are so few options on the market.\n\nAnswer:",

It is a little unrealistic that everything would work out so well for this family. It is horribly corny. It is unbelieveable because Hayley Mills has a British accent and her family does not.

But it's no mellowing out at the expense of great songwriting and almost singable (!) sounds. It isn't perfect: \"The Murder Mystery\" doesn't hold up to more than one listening, and \"After Hours\" works OK as an album closer but is otherwise mostly fluff.

Where it falls down is in the quality of the DVD. The color was off and faded in a number of places, and it is visibly a stage performance that was roughly adapted for video recording. One of the benefits of watching a performance on the small screen is that you can see greater detail of expression on the actors faces and your view is directed to the dramatic focus. It's like having the best seat in the opera, practically on stage. As such, this recording disappoints. Too many wide angle shots and set pieces that, while perfectly acceptable for stage, become distracting on screen.I greatly prefer the Vienna Philharmonic production, also available on Deutsche Grammophon.\n\nAnswer:",

It tells the story of 12 couples who found love after the death of a spouse, but I don't feel that the information contained in these stories would be that helpful to a widow or widower since everyone's situation is so different. Most of the couples in the book are living together and don't seem motivated to marry and that was a disappointment to me. There are times when I was reading about the physical intimacy between the couples that I wanted to shout \"Too much information\". The book seems to imply that the only way to recover from the death of a spouse is to begin a relationship with someone else and I believe that to be patently false.

Yes, it's the classic 'right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing' scenario. Are the hands posessed? Or is Orlac just bonkers?Admittedly the film itself is rather disjointed and badly paced (Mel Ferrer in particular gives a weak portrayal of Orlac) but it gains three stars solely for the performance of Christopher Lee as the evil magician who tries to goad Orlac deeper into insanity. Lee hams it up in a completely over-the-top Evil Genius way whenever he's on screen, but the sheer strength and audience interest lent by his presence is a welcome relief from the insipid blandness of Orlac's angst.If you're after ironic laughs rather than scares, cheesy special effects, and a bang-up acting job from Lee, this is your film.\n\nAnswer:",

I hate most chick lit due to the writing style and obsession about clothes, and the writing style is kinda like that (complete with description of outfits). I keep plugging away every so often because of what the book represents, but it is so hard.The sad thing is that underneath the the crap I hate (the writing style, the outfit and hair descriptions) is a very interesting and worthwhile examination of male love and the construction of gay male identity and black masculinity in general.There is a reason these books are considered groundbreaking, but I just dislike the writing style so intensely.\n\nAnswer:",

Shteyngart is a very funny writer and usually, Falstaffian/Gargantuan lead characters work for me big time. But ultimately, this book is all about asides and sight gags that get to be repititive after about 100 pages. There is no real plot or arc to the narrative. It just goes on and on and on and what seems funny at first starts to turn into a snooze.This book is really a bloated short story. As someone below noted, the short story that apparently was the basis for this book is much, much better. It was hilarious. Reading this book is like watching a mediocre comedy in a movie theater after seeing its two minute, joke-filled trailer. You feel a bit cheated.Mr. Shteyngart has a lot of talent.

The gradual introduction of the characters and the environment is really interesting but all of a sudden the book ends and you realize that there was never really any plot.This book is almost pure description and hardly any story and it is such a shame because it would have made a brilliant book if it had been developed further. Instead it reads more like the author sitting down for coffee with you and describing this really cool idea he has just had for a book he might write one day. I'm hoping that he actually does that one day because the idea really is good (it's impossible to actually describe it because that would spoil the book - sorry :)). \"Under the skin\" is definitely worth reading if you can just overlook the lack of plot and see it as a very interesting description instead.\n\nAnswer:",

Rob Trujillo did not play on this album. The majority of this recording was complete before he was officially made a member of the band. Bob Rock (record producer) did the bass for this album.Now....I'm a fan of the older material and I also play the older material so I can say that this album is far from being back to old school. Lars sounds horrible on the drums (maybe it was just the horrible production) and Kirk does not solo. This album sounds more like Linkin Park and Lim Biskit (bands I loathe) than Metallica.With that in mind, I'm glad I only borrowed the cd from a friend and didn't buy it myself.

There are the striving immigrants, the rich kid, the poor kids, the borderline-autistic kids, etc. It's fascinating, but a bit too pat at the same time. Editing choices make the director's allegiances clear and manipulate the viewer's emotions. \"Spellbound\" reminded me a lot of a recent cable documentary on child beauty pageants--the director used the medium to cast judgment on parents and indict American values at the same time, probably from the comfortable vantage point of S.F. or the Upper West Side. When are documentary filmmakers going to focus their energy on genuine muckraking instead of slinging mud at hapless middle-class folk?

I found it okay and relatively interesting, although I can't say I gleaned a lot of new information/knowledge. It is an easy read and written for men (I am a woman). Written by a man who is now living in freedom from a sexual addiction, there were some good insights, although nothing profound (I thought). The scripture he used was very good, although I thought he used some verses repetitively. He said a few times that he had a 5 step process/plan for gaining freedom from an addiction, but he never clarified them in the book, leaving the reading wondering what they were or which helpful things he listed were they. I really appreciated chapters 12 and 15, in which Gallagher acknowledged that it is a spiritual battle and there are spiritual forces which we battle against. Not every Western/American Christian counselor will acknowledge that, even though it is scriptural and real. Overall, decent book.\n\nAnswer:",

Certainly the only one worth buying in the Sharp line (255-450-650U). The Viewscreen and remote are good. The Zoom is terrific, and the CatsEye feature is pretty amazing in dusk lighting, but the daylight picture quality is only comparable to 8mm in my estimation and 12 years experience with two previous Canon 8mm camcorders. I expected better, but even with 460k pixels it is grainy, and only marginally better than my old Canon 8mm cameras with 270k pixels. The Still capture is again very grainy, and painfully slow browsing thru the thumbnails (now shopping for a still camera). I hope the camera is more durable than indicated by some other reviewers.All in all - it is a good cheap replacement for my broken Canon 8mm, but it is not a step up in video quality that a more expensive Canon ZR30 might be. 4~5 stars for value, but 2~3 stars for \"digital\" quality.\n\nAnswer:",

Anyway, I just spent too much time checking out the reviews for James Blunt, and was befuddled at how many people passionately love him, when he obviously isn't that good. I really think what's going on there is that people want him to be deep and a genius so they make him one-so they get to listen to \"deep\" music without having to be challenged in any way. I know music is personal, but Blunt is tripe. But here, with Mr. Oldham, I could understand how opinions could defer so widely. His music is difficult, and therefore when you like it, it is really a personal, intimate thing. I love this album, and maybe even if you don't you could understand how someone could, unlike Mr. Blunt's pablum.\n\nAnswer:",

What especially stands out is \"When Christmas Comes To Town\", featuring a wonderful duet by 2 kids with voices that are very sweet. This song captures the mood of the movie and is simply incredible. \"Believe\" sung by Josh Groban is another marvellous song and I simply love it.My complaint though, is that on this cd, there are only 8 tracks which were composed for this movie. The other tracks are all from long ago and just doesn't make the cd worth it. The score by Alan Silvestri is wonderful but with the other half of the cd being old songs, I'm not sure if it is worth the price.

Shania has truly tapped into the fun of being a woman in the 90's! Her songs make me think of everything from the excitement of a \"girls' night out\" with her heart pumping rythms on \"Man, I feel like a woman\", to the wonder of the male-female electric energy. I can't help but get all mushy when I listen to her ballads, and the way she gets just enough twang in there to spice things up. She does a good job of getting you to think about what really matters in life, but makes it fun! Black Eyes, Blue Tears sums it up for me: \" I'd rather die standing than live on my knees, beggin' please....\" I've never been a country music fan, but if Shania Twain is country, then so am I!\n\nAnswer:",

Yes I actually own a pair of 901 Series VI Walnut finish speakers complete with stands and equalizer, so I know what I'm talking about.If you pay full price for these you will be disappointed. The low bass is almost nonexistent and the treble is also nonexistent. You will need to crank up your bass to extremely high levels to compensate, and the treble that is there is very harsh. The direct-reflecting 901 requires a wall positioning with no nearby clutter and the speakers are not shielded so keep them at least 3 feet away from the television. It does give an 'airy' sound but somehow manages to completely destroy the stereo imaging in the process.These would make good DJ speakers with a powerful amp, but are useless for any other music application I can think of.\n\nAnswer:",

And I've been drinking coffee for 25 years. First off, if you like your coffee stronger and add more grounds than most coffee drinkers do, then beware. When the water drips in, the grounds float out of the filter/holder area, and end up in the coffee, and all over the coffeemaker. It doesn't seem to drip right, and the grounds get redirected wherever. And no matter how I make it, more grounds less grounds, it tastes horrible! Flat and bitter and oily. My last coffeemaker was great, but it died. Mr. Coffee in the thermal carafe. I purchased this B&D on a clearance and I think I know why. I'm returning it tomorrow to get my money back.

We liked how the fire is set up - not too zoomed in, and with the logs stacked in a space that actually looks like a fireplace. Plus, it started as a large fire, but burned slowly to a soft rolling fire - over a period of almost 2 hours. We turned down the crackling sounds until it was just the right amount for our room.

This is a charming, funny book that will make you laugh out loud, well up with tears, and gasp in shock.In fact, at times, it's a bit TOO shocking.... and the main character seems to take in all the outlandish abuse without so much as a peep of protest. That fact made this book a little hard for me to swallow, since I am hard-headed and outspoken enough that I NEVER would have put up with a fraction of what she did. I was also annoyed with the ending, and how many aspects of the storyline were not concluded very well or at all (hopefully the upcoming movie will do that better).However, as frustrating as it was to watch Nanny continually get the short end of the stick, and to not have a terribly satisfying ending, I still enjoyed this clever novel greatly!Grade: B+\n\nAnswer:",

They were my introduction to ballet, and the dancers I remember were Alexandra Danilova, Natalie Krassovska, Frederic Franklin, and Nicolas Magellanes. Others came -- Ruthanna Boris, Mia Slavenska, Nina Novak -- but my memory of ballet is full of these early performances and those early dancers. It is inspiring to see them in this film, as full of love for their art as they were when performing.There is one area where I disagre slightly. I remember Nina Novak in the chorus, and she had charisma. You watched her. When she was given more important roles, you continued to watch her. What she did in her private life was irrelevant; she drew the eye.This is a must-see for every lover of ballet who is curious about how it started in America, and became the center of interest that it holds today.Baronova is astonishing!\n\nAnswer:",

All the songs are done with punk rock edginess and intensity but the maturity and coherence of the gorup make for mellower song structures. Frusciante is at the top of his game, his riffing and strumming is finger licking good, solidified by the electricity of flea's bass work. Kiedis continues in the vein of californication's 'around the world' and 'scar tissue' with his voice seeped in bittersweet. The mix is strengthened by double tracking of guitars and extensive use of keys time checked by solid percussion backing. By The Way is ambiguous and hard to define, but a beautifully intense and honest piece of work. The peppers maintain their relevance and poise in a music world dominated by emptiness.Fill up on RHCP!...\n\nAnswer:",

This was a mistake and I ended up returning the camera because of the loud motor mechanism that resulted in a constant train sound in the background of my video. This is my first review on Amazon but I felt compelled to express my disdain about the audio quality of this product.I researched the product on various message boards and they seemed to indicate that this was the result of the microphone gain being adjusted in quiet environments. To my dismay, it seems that the noise is picked up in any environment because the motor mechanism is simply very very loud. The noise is captured on tape and is so loud it is hard to filter out without ruining the sound track.I purchased a Panasonic GS14 and while the CCD isn't as good as the JVC's, there is no motor noise at all. The difference is night and day.My advice is to pass on this model as the noise is very excessive and ruins an otherwise competent product.\n\nAnswer:",

The Acting is typical for the Genre(Big tough guy with emotions about his family)but the special effects in this one raise the level a little for future action movies. 6th day managed to pull off some simply stunning effects. If you are an Arnold fan (and if you are reading this review you most likely are!) then this is a must have on DVD. Not only do you get to see the movie but you get an inside look at how they made the special effects. I won't go as far as to say Arnold is back but he's definitely on the way!\n\nAnswer:",

To give an idea of the size, it easily fits my thin REI hiking backpack (with 15\" laptop), water jug, coffee mug, change of clothes, wallet, and other small work necessities, and can still roll up 3x for water-proofing. Also, although it's not very important, I love the color and it's a very light-weight, nice-looking dry bag. The only thing I would say that's not so good is that with all that heavy stuff if I pick it up by the top, the clips sometimes come apart (I think the clips might be a little bit on the weak side).\n\nAnswer:",

This one is not her best but is still worthy of being read because it explores the concept of gender reversal i.e. the roles of men and women in society are reversed. The author doesn't explain the reasons for this but implies that is is due to a scarcity of men.The female characters are better developed and more interesting than the male. All of the woman have strong personalities. The main flaw in the book is that Jerin, the male protogonist, is supposed to be a young male approaching marriage age. He vacillates between being a juvenile and an adult male. His relationship with older women comes off as a little creepy and unsettling.The author does get kudos for exploring an unusual plot premise whose twist is a worthwile read but not one that you will want to stay up all night to finish.\n\nAnswer:",

But, this first book, in my opinion is not really very well written. I'm halfway thru the 3rd book right now. Her descriptive writing is really not very good and I found myself skipping over words and knowing I didn't miss a thing. Did I feel like a lot was missing from the movie? Not at all. Quite frankly, being on the 3rd book, my feeling is that her writing is much better on screen than in type. I always had a problem with the 90-year-old and a 16 or 17-year-old. At least this 1st book gives an explanation for both their behaviors that makes sense to me. However, it paints a picture of Bella that totally makes no sense and does not jibe with the movie character I remember. Anyways, I was a big Interview With a Vampire et al. fan, but not really here. This is fun and very quick reading. Two stars because I don't think you should expect a lot.\n\nAnswer:",

So there are the usual Southern characters, I know because I am Southern. There is the crazy aunt, the crazy cousin, both were deliciously insane; the goody goody, Alex who sincerely, worked my last nerve at points, and it was pretty decent, it was a little choppy but I enjoyed it over all.

I get a good workout without wearing myself out. There are (2) separate workouts each with a warm up and cool down. The group ranges in age from 20's to 70's and acts like they're happy to be there, which I find inspiring. IMO, the music is better than some of Leslie's other DVD's. The 'stretchie' is used during the 3 mile walk close to the end; it is not used at all during the 4 mile walk. Leslie does talk quite a bit...I don't find it annoying. It isn't one of the hardest, but I feel great after I'm done. You can boost it easily by stepping wider, bigger arm movements, jogging during the walking segments. It's also good for beginners as it is not TOO strenuous. The versatility makes it a good one.\n\nAnswer:",

Be aware that it's only 48 pages in hardcover! It was originally published by Editions Carabas in Europe, but this particular version was released in the US by Dark Horse Comics (its first English translation). This is a collection of pin-ups and short stories all focusing on vampires. The stories are very much like what you'd find in Heavy Metal: great artwork, with plots ranging from decent to confusing. The lineup includes Bryan Talbot, Philippe Caza, Benot Springer, David Lloyd, Mike Mignola (pin-up), Tommy Lee Edwards, Richard Marazano, Gary Gianni (pin-up), Yoann and Sfar (hilarious Batman parody), and others. The book is topped off by a great cover by Matthieu Lauffray. Basically, the book looks great but is lacking in coherent storylines and content. Still, if you're a comic art afficionado, this is a good deal.\n\nAnswer:",

I felt our family got to know a little more about what his childhood was like by watching this show.My parents were down this weekend and I rec'd the first season, so just like we did 30 some odd years ago, we gathered around the tv and enjoyed the first three episodes. I was tickled to see how good the picture was and was also impressed with the audio.

For a \"trance\" CD, these song's are short and are okay if you're a radio-cut song addict. Not the best, but some songs are okay. Two stars. You earned every single one.\n\nAnswer:",

In this novel yet another serial killer meets yet another hardboiled middle age policeman, who, as is nowadays standard fare, has some personal problems. (usually this problem is a broken marriage or a murdered daughter/wife or the inability to in the past having been able to protect an innocent life or a brother who in childhood went unaccountably missing. Generally, these problems are compounded by alcohol and midlife crisis. Take your pick).

The unadulterated RAWK of Tenacious D lay primarily in their simplicity and passion; this album has been overproduced, as was my fear when I heard of this undertaking.

Others have detailed the plot line, so I'll just give you my thoughts. This book is fast paced, but it lacks the suspense books like Relic possess. I loved the theme park setting. And the concept for that park is breath-taking, but I felt it was under-utilized. The park is so clever that dozens of twists and turns leap to mind that could have added suspense to this novel. The plot is predictable and you know who the bad guy is almost immediately. My other complaint with the story is the lack of fleshing out John Doe. I kept wanting it to be Eric Nightingale come for revenge on the commercialization of his dream, but we never get a good look at who John Doe is. All this being said, I still recommend this book as a fast paced and fun read, but I much prefer the Lincoln/Child colaborations. If you haven't read any of them pick up Relic and Reliquary or Cabunet of Curiousities first.\n\nAnswer:",

There is a small gap between the plates, so unless you squeeze it as hard as you can, it will not press down on your hair to straighten it. Plus, it curves slightly, which means your hand naturally slips upwards, towards the HOT plates. I cannot believe something so terrible made it through testing.I'm actually a fan of the brand, I've always bought Conair hair dryers and they last forever. I figured, what could go wrong with a straightener made by them? The answer is \"everything\". I'm only writing this so perhaps one person out there will be spared from wasting money on such a horrible, ineffective product. You might as well burn your money, because that will do as much to straighten your hair as this product does (i.e. nothing).\n\nAnswer:",

The latter objective was achieved by the simple device of suspending the redemption of Reichsbank notes in gold.\"For me, the above excerpt was the only salient section of the book.

Once you get it on properly it is very comfortable, and usually puts our 3 month old to sleep right away. We have a local hockey/ice arena that allows people to walk laps during the cold winter months, and I have never had a problem keeping her warm because she shares my body heat.If I had a complaint, it would be that it is somewhat complicated to wrap and tie, and generally requires some help to keep it from getting on the floor. This isn't a big deal in our house, but in public it can be difficult to keep the fabric from getting on the ground. That being said, its just something that takes a little practice, and the more we use it, the better we get at it. The fact that it is more versatile, and much more comfortable than the Baby Bjorn far outweighs the minor inconvenience factor.I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a baby carrier.\n\nAnswer:",

Clearly the author's story is poignant and inspiring, but that really gets lost in barely mediocre writing. Swander grossly minimizes details related to New Mexico and its cultures, and she does the same with her descriptions of mystical figures and religion, and these sort of bald descriptions & generalizations really weaken the power of the story and her credibility as a writer. This propensity also makes the story feel unfocused and unguided. The book just doesn't read very authentically. I wish I had a different experience reading it, but I didn't.\n\nAnswer:",

I remember skimming through it thinking it was the worst purchase I ever made for an album. There is nothing but talentless no-name rappers and singers throughout and just forgettable tracks, one after another. There are only 3 songs out of 16 that are worth keeping and actually have replay value, I still enjoy them to this day. Of course it's because they sound like some effort was put into them by great rappers like KRS-One, Nas, King Tee and an actual song with Dr. Dre on it.KEEPERS:East Coast/West Coast KillasBeen There, Done ThatStr8 GoneThrow the rest in the garbage and press delete.\n\nAnswer:",

The show includes a surprisingly rich story, which is also quite dark for a TV show. Unfortunately, after watching an imported DVD set, it seems that the series' producers spent more resources than necessary on the first episodes, and didn't quite realize that the story needed to fit in a single TV season.The reason I say that is because they left a HUGE gap in the storyline. The story does reach an ending, but some very important pieces of the storyline were skipped.A series with such high production values should not have this sort of problem. Thankfully the manga includes what was left out. In fact, I hope that someone picks up the manga and decides to continue producing this wonderful series. A story this good deserves a more complete series.\n\nAnswer:",

The radio is small and can be put on our small night stand. She can hook her iPod to it and control with the remote. Sound quality is good.I just want to several things that needs to be improved to make this product a perfect one:a. The AM radio signal reception is not good even with attached antenna. We live in a high-rise concrete building and signal level is fairly low, but still I feel like the radio reception should be better. No problem with FM.b. Every time you connect your iPod to the radio, you need to take off the iPod skin. It would be nice ff the design could leave space for the skin.Other than those two, my wife likes the radio very much. She doesn't have the problem some reviews mentioned: alarm volume control when the alarm starts with iPod; clock display too bright at night.All in all, it's a very good product and I recommend it.\n\nAnswer:",

Matt Dillon is good in just about anything, and he and Kate Hudson have some decent chemistry here. Unfortunately, all the actors are playing roles they've played in other films. There just aren't enough good, original jokes to keep the film running. I give the disc an extra star for the hilarious alternate horror trailer, and Wilson's energetic seminar.\n\nAnswer:",

Most importantly, it keeps odors in check! My son has started solids & his poops now get so stinky that the whole room will smell for a while after a changing but I've left several bad diapers in the pail & haven't had an odor problem yet.

My son was required to read this book for his summer reading list. The struggle that young people go through in life is sometimes overlooked. I feel that Gardiner focuses on the struggles. Willy has decided to save the farm and what he believes to be his Grandfathers life. In this story a young boy must make adult decisions. Willy could have easily let his Grandfather stay with someone else but he chose to care for him and perform the chores of raising a crop. These are very mature decisions made by a young boy. I could feel the love Willy had for his Grandfather as well as the love Searchlight had for Willy. Although the ending was sad it allowed us to view the reality of life. Some struggles end in death and not with happy endings. I would encourage people to read and look beyond the words on the pages. This book was intense with emotional moments that would bring tears to anyones eyes.\n\nAnswer:",

Now, philosophy is a science crucially needed today, but it has to be the right philosophy. Sadly, we live in a Platonic age and the continuting disintegration of America into a fascist/religious nightmare.

The block of shave cream came to the very top of the bowl, so the lid would not sit into the bowl. When you want to whip up some lather, with the brush, the bowl is so light weight that you have to hold it with the other hand. The lid has no handle, so you have to pick up the lid from the side, and get slippery shave cream on your fingers, which you have to wash off before you handle the razor.

Anyhow, that hose is, just like it says, 20'- however, it is really tight and hard to pull and vacuum at the same time and will always pull the vacuum cleaner over with a crash! It marked my wall with a huge black mark, so lay it on the floor before starting, should you buy! If you purchase to do stairs, and your staircase has landings it will rub against your railings, something to think about. My opinion is maybe still better to use a handheld vac instead, plus the vacuum does not come with a wide bare floor attachment, so it's not good for that either, oh well!\n\nAnswer:",

The only song I really hate is Celebrity and some lines of other songs have me rolling my eyes. But on the opposite end, the only songs I really like are The Game Is Over, The Two Of Us, Tell Me, Tell Me... Baby, Just Don't Tell Me That and Do Your Thing.

For those of you who don't read much, or have a hard time reading, this book is a very good place for you to start learning more about the Mass. The author assumes that you are Catholic, so those readers who are not Catholic should look elsewhere for a book explaining the Mass.I would highly recommend this book to young Catholics (7th to 12th grade) or to those who don't like a book that is heavy in theology.As a further note of what to expect, I provide this quote from the author detailing his intentions:\"The main concern of this book is not so much the beauty of some prayer or the meaningfulness of a gesture or the profundity of a rubric but, rather, the significance of those prayers, gestures, and rubrics in relation to the whole Mass.\"From the \"Introduction\", p.10\n\nAnswer:",

These two seemed to want to just chastise you for not grabbing the first guy you found at 18 and starting to have kids. I also found them a little pompous (as in yea - I had fertility problems but now look at me I have two kids, ha ha). Any woman who is going through infertility does not need this sort of info. I found it almost cruel. However, I could have ignored the stupid criticisms if there was any really useful info in the book. There wasn't. Most of it was very basic. If you are actually dishing out $25 for an infertility book you have probably already discovered cycle days and cervical mucus and the fact you need a fertility specialist. Try another book.

He is NOT related to the famous Black Elk in any way. The real Black Elk's family has been trying to get Wallace to quit deceptively using their family name for decades. He is not even of the same tribe. What is truly sad is that so many whites who don't know any better will look to a shady character like Wallace for guidance. Wallace sells ceremonies, which is considered unethical by native traditionalists. In this book he reveals a lot of things that are supposed to be kept private or only taught orally and face to face in the traditional way. Wallace has greatly dismayed native people with his selling out to the New Age for the sake of cash. The saddest thing is that, nearly thirty years ago, he once was a respected medicine man. But he threw all that away for cash. If you want to learn about native religions, try Vine Deloria's God Is Red. But don't give this opportunist your cash instead.\n\nAnswer:",

It was based on the same script written by Gustaf Molander, also starred Ingrid Bergman as Anita Hoffman, but this time cast Leslie Howard as Holger Brant.

There are twelve great tracks (including the bonus track), and they are all either kick-ass rock and roll or softer, emotional songs that blend in beautifully with the guitars.The singer, Josey Scott, is great at screaming while still being able to sing those beautiful ballads. He my look a little weird, but all I car about is the music, and in that department, he is unscathed. (I like that analogy). The saliva gutarist is also amazing and has improved greatly.

Unfortunately, I wasted time and money on this one. I, like many of the other reviewers, feel that it simply did not live up to it's possibilities.The controls are my main complaint. It really doesn't register half of the movements you make in the mini games and that DOES get annoying. I believe that time and practice could make a few of the games playable, but, I need to emphasize A FEW.The main game is okay, the controls are definitely better than the mini game portion. However, I wanted this game primarily for the 2-4 player capabilities. The main game did not justify the $50.00 purchase for me.My overall impression and opinion is that this game needed more time in testing before they released it into the markets.

The messaging and the genre-based language in the book went right over my 4 year old daughter's head and I found myself having to stop and explain things on almost every page (either that or reword the text in my head before actually reading the page to her in my edited form). I enjoy using books to help expose her to new vocabulary, but in this case, it wasn't necessarily kid-friendly vocabulary and the process interrupted my reading so much that it ended up getting in the way of the actual story. Maybe she's just not the right age. I do have to say that the pictures are great; Nash is a terrific illustrator.\n\nAnswer:",

The BAD first: For a movie that was less than 60 minutes, it was too heavy on seeing the inside of a few posh resorts and the people who own them. Also, too much of the pretty host posing in her various bathing suits in front of her mirror, in the pool, by the falls, in the fountain, in the dining room, on the massage table, on a lounger......The GOOD: Some nice shots of the scenery as seen from the resorts, a quick glimpse of the volcano, a great boat ride mangrove tour, some quick glimpses of local towns from the car, a fishing trip, a cute sloth, a little shopping, dancing in nightclub, and nice waterfalls. I feel that I have to buy another video to see Costa Rica, the people, the land, the towns, and what to expect if I go there and can't afford the posh resort.\n\nAnswer:",

The blade looked to be decent steel with a very glossy/shiny mirror-like finish. Under heavy prying I'd occasionally feel it start to flex, and would back off before damaging the tool. After 4 years, I finally wore it out. So, I happily ordered a replacement in summer 2010. When I received it, I immediately noticed the difference in appearance. The blade had a freckled/frosty finish. It appeared to be a different alloy. The second time I used the new version of the tool, while applying much less pressure than the first one would consistantly withstand, it snapped in two. Broke cleanly at the weld between blade and handle. It's a shame they have become so fragile, the blade size and comfort of the handle were perfect for me.\n\nAnswer:",

Since it's designed as a shower radio, you are generally right next to it and moving, causing the signal to go from loud to scratchy to soft to loud again.* The dials cannot be easily tuned with wet fingers.In short -- this is a poor radio, and it's a TERRIBLE shower radio.

This violates basic principles of publication and scholarship.2) This is in fact an abridged version of the original English-language translation by Henry Reeve, dating from sometime before 1862. Unless you want to re-create the experience of a modern Frenchman confronted with de Tocqueville's somewhat archaic French by reading the text in somewhat archaic English, I would seek out any of the more recent translations: there are at least three.3) The ellipses, that is, the abridgements, have sometimes been made to conceal some of the author's less flattering views America. In fact I suspect this is a \"patriotic\" abridgement. For example, in the second chapter of part one, Heffner has omitted references to some of the excesses of Puritan law in New England which the notoriously even-handed Tocqueville had cited.\n\nAnswer:",

Ok, they may have been stars back then, but for the life of me, I don't know why. They are definitely the weak link in each episode. In fact, they are a distraction.

For instance, Ben, and Australian cave guide, sometimes has an Aussie accent and colloquialisms in his speech and sometimes he speaks with American expressions and speech. Additionally, it is irritating when the author does not refer to the proper rank structure for the navy and marine corps. There are no privates or majors in the navy or marine corps, for instance, yet the story presents this. For all of the minor irritating factors about the narrative, the story is just not that compelling to read. It is a shame, for I love adventure stories. I would avoid this book like the plague. Instead, look toward Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Riptide and the Pendergast novels are superb thriller/action fiction reads.\n\nAnswer:",

Billed as the raunchiest film since Bad Santa, my expectations were high. As far as I'm concerned, the raunchier the better, but seldom is a film that calls itself raunchy, actually raunchy. Cameron Diaz was terrific, but the story was extremely weak. There is zero character development, I wanted to punch most of the supporting cast, and as far as being funny, it's only good for a snicker here and there. It's a predictable story about a gold digger seeking money to get plastic surgery. Parts of it are painful and the rest of it is just really stupid. Honestly, if it wasn't for the use of the F word, this movie would be rated PG-13 at best. Diaz is a fantastic actress and the story had so many possibilities, but they were all overlooked. The result, another mediocre, overrated, comedy billing itself as raunchy.\n\nAnswer:",

David seamlessly blends classical technique with pop and jazz sensibilities, and makes it sound so relaxed. This is a live recording and it sounds as if David were sitting in your living room with you. The recording and performance are flawless and yet the songs remain comfortable and relaxed. David performs original, jazz and classical compositions on this disc. Original pieces Blue Counterpoint and On the Way are refreshing and uplifting. David's arrangememnts of Birdland and Spain are funky and exctiting and his performance of Bach's 6th Cello Suite is also dynamic and expressive. If you like great fingerstyle guitar (and everything in between), David Cullen delivers it all with taste and great technique!\n\nAnswer:",

It is a quick and easy read, and will really give you a leg-up when you begin formal coursework.HOWEVER, if you are looking to learn about hypothesis testing, statistical tests, and how data are typically analyzed and presented at the end of clinical trials, this book will not help you.

I didn't bother contacting Bose because I had long since thrown away the receipt.From investigating various high end headphones, I noticed one major flaw with Bose - extremely thin wiring to the ear cups.

Although this was already finished with lacquer, I choose to sand down the parts (since you have to easily assemble once you receive) and then re-stain with a dark cherry wood varnish. Although this process took some time due to the nooks and crevices, it was so worth it! I sanded the pieces and put it together first, then stained and varnished it.It turned out great and is very sturdy. I have it on a flat kitchen floor surface, so I have no worry about it tipping over. The flat top allows me to keep my decanter on top, as well as my bottle openers in a bowl.The design keeps the bottles with a slight tilt toward the cork, which is ideal for my wine storage needs.\n\nAnswer:",

And another. I gave it time to soak into my mind. I asked myself, \"Why did Linkin Park decide to take this lighter sound?\". Then I realized that they decided to take the approach of letting the lyrics speak for themselves instead of forcing the sound into the listener. Give this album some time, look past what it is missing from the older Linkin Park albums and see what it has gained.

We purchased this game thinking it was representative of Disney interactive products. At first, our five year old son enjoyed playing it but quickly bored of it. Kids have to repeat the phonics exercises over and over and over again - sometimes more than 10 times - to receive any kind of fan-fare or reward in retrieving the Sorcerer's lost items. Excellent graphics and great activities but there certainly should be more verbal or graphic reward as incentives to make the child want to further pursue the game. Kids of this age react much better to more frequent reward...and this game just disappoints for computer active, advanced children. Other Disney products have been better received.\n\nAnswer:",

Oh and the characters you can unlock through completing bonus levels are basically clones of other characters with different color clothes.

Why can't we appreciate all of them? All singers have their strength and weakness. Callas is at her best here in this album. She is very moving and her technique is superb. The Mad scence from Anna Bolena is just stunningly beautiful. The final cabaletta shows Callas at home in one of the most challenging arias in bel canto operas. Her trills and scales are beyond criticism. This is one of my favorite albums together with Sutherland's \"The Art of Prima Donna\" and Price's blue album.\n\nAnswer:",

Maybe it was because he looked like an intergalactic Al Bundy or even a skinhead Tom Baker. Anyhow, that's all past, and we now have an actor who has outranked the legendary Tom Baker as favourite Doctor. David Tennant is the best thing to come to DOCTOR WHO in a long time. He's more believable than his predecessor, and his portrayal of our favourite Time Lord is the best I've seen in quite some time. Series 2 has preserved the spirit of classic DW while taking a bold step into the future (no pun intended), andstory arcs like 'Rise of the Cybermen'/'Age of Steel' and the season finale will not disappoint. 'The Idiot's Lantern' could've been from season 24-26.'School Reunion' and 'Tooth and Claw' are also excellent. Simply put, there is not one single story I didn't like. My highest recommendation, needs to be 10 stars!\n\nAnswer:",

Gardner's example is a writer describing his red-faced, weeping father as looking like a baby trying to squeeze out a dump. Though I don't have an example from Garland -- I couldn't get rid of the book fast enough -- believe me, it's full of them. The whole book, in fact, is nothing but a series of ridiculously inappropriate and wholly incredible reactions -- e.g., the narrator risks his life to get away from dope farmers, then returns to taunt them.

While the cast is, as ever, excellent, and Gary Oldman was great as always, the alterations made to the book diminished the tale, I thought. And was I the only one to notice the altered geography around the castle? The movie was ok, but would have been better had they filmed the book as it is. Leaving out the second Quiddich match was, I think, a mistake. On the other hand, Buckbeak was wonderful, the werewolf effects were good, and Gary Oldman gibbering to Lupin \"Let's kill him now!\" was priceless. Emma Thompson was hilarious, too. But nobody can replace the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, I'm sad to say.Overall, not bad, but not as good as I had hoped.

And I do agree that it hardly rocks at all. maybe if it actually rocked it would be more enjoyable. however, I will hang on to it because it is very cute and I love the colors so I guess it makes a nice little arrangement for her room and I did manage to get some very cute pics of her on it.

It's made that job a lot easier; BUT, there are 2 flaws in my opinion: The scoop part is curved upward, so If you're trying to fling the poop elsewhere, it has a boomerang effect and can come right back at ya! (I throw it in a empty wooded lot I own, not a neighbor's yard ;))I also don't know why they didn't make the handle longer. I'm only 5'4\" tall; and between the short handle and oddly curved rake, I really have to crouch down to get the perfect angle so I can catch my prey. It really should not be that difficult. Just make a longer handle, with a straight rake and I'd be soooo happy! That's why I only gave this 4 out of 5 stars. I do recommend it over all other poop scoopers for grass though. It really speeds up the process.\n\nAnswer:",

Her memoir in the book, \"My Life in France\" is far more fascinating and substantive and should have been made into its own film. I think that Meryl Streep does an excellent job as Julia and Stanley Tucci is perfect as Paul Child.It felt like Julia Child was being used to \"prop up\" the weaker story of Julie Powell. While the story of Julie Powell and her blog is cute and enjoyable, after she completes all of Julia's 540+ recipes, her story has nothing much left to say. By contrast, Julia Child's message is timeless and will continue to delight and inspire. In a competition for screen time, we are allowed to only skim the surface of Julia Child in this film- and her story is the one we should care about.\n\nAnswer:",

This recording is a revelation, and will surelyput these great songs on the musical map. Ms. Farley's beautiful voice, sensitive phrasing, perfect pronunciation and understanding of the style, and Constable's outstanding piano accompaniment justify Gramophone's selection of this CD as theEditor's Choice.BIS is doing a great service to this music, as it has done with Tirino's path braking piano series.

Debbie Reynolds turns in a hilarious cameo (belting out \"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\", Rizzo's big number from GREASE), and the supporting cast, led by David Duchovny, Stephen Spinella and Dash Mihok is sensational.For musical theatre fans, CONNIE AND CARLA is highly-recommended.\n\nAnswer:",

Total of 44 tracks. Discs one and two are re-edits and live versions of songs off their first two records. Sure, it's always good to hear \"Roller Coaster\", \"Monkey Island\", \"Reverberation\", my personal 13th Floor favorite \"She Lives (In A Time Of Her Own)\" and others, but THIS is really over doing it. Disc three is mostly unfamiliar tunes that I've never heard before, however some of the tunes here are actually decent. I know this is a 3-CD box set, but I STILL thought it was over-priced. Not only is this title for completists, but for someone who has ca$h to burn as well.\n\nAnswer:",

I have taken gen chem, organic, analytical, physical, biochem, photochem, and inorganic. This book was poorly written and extremely bland in terms of the pages. The sections of each chapter feel like they should be their own chapter in itself because the authors go on and on and on without stopping. And once you get to the next section, its a blunt start. There's little continuity between sections. Each page has little to offer in terms of supporting diagrams and tables. In addition, the examples given are not explained and consequently do nothing to help the reader's understanding.\n\nAnswer:",

I recommend this book to Non-Muslims as well as Muslims. Even an Atheist can benefit from it. We humans are weak by nature and if we are not given guidance, we will definitly go astray. There is no such thing as a man or woman without desires and we will not be able to control them unless someone tells us how to.The book of Allah(GOD) is the only book that can do it. Not the Bible, which does not forbid wrong and immorality like the Quran does. Look at the disobedience of kids in the US to their parents and look how much smut is on the TV. This is a Christian Society and only Islam and can help it. This religion is the final message from God and it is meant to help us understand the purpose of life. Go here if you have any questions about this way of life called Islam [...]\n\nAnswer:",

Probably every one can tell you an experience she has had where some dirty old (or young) man has tried to paw her just because he thinks it's ok.

I just used some Command hooks to help stabilize the shelves so they wouldn't swing out when I opened or shut the door. The REAL problem is that the top of the rack I received is curved. It may be decorative, but just precisely how am I supposed to hang a shelf unit by 2 over-the-door hangers on a CURVE? The hangers slide around, the rack shifts, and one of my Command hooks has already broken off because of the shifting weight. This was a LOUSY $20 shelf, and I wish I had realized it when I still had the packaging so I could send this piece of garbage back. If you buy one of these, check the top before you hang it!

I am not familiar with the Pegasus's FTL drive or the Raptor's FTL drives, but chances are they are not compatible with the FTL drives of civilian cruisers. What tactical advantage was there to strip the civilian ships of their FTL drives? I can understand transferring key civilian personnel to the Pegasus for mission related reasons, but due to the large number of deaths aboard Pegasus surely they could have spared the room for some of the families. Caine could have kept in tow the civilian ships capable of FTL travel much like Adama's convoy. There are other aspects of Razor that annoyed me but overall I felt it wasn't worth watching.\n\nAnswer:",

As a gun owner, I dislike the lack of intellectual honesty that is endemic in the anti-gun literature but I also recognize the repetitive, almost ritual pro-gun prose.Kates and Kleck address the traditional guns'n crime issues but also say that some types of gun control are desireable (ones aimed at disarming or disabling people who've demonstrated membership in the \"criminal class\").They address in some detail the intellectual dishonesty behind much of anti-gun \"science\" and the biases in much of the press coverage of the \"gun debate\".It's a very informative and readable book.

This book continues from where the last one left off and pretty much consists of the same plot - Cassie running for her life and going back in time to save people. To me there is nothing distinguishable between the first and second book (kind of like the first two Halloween movies). While I enjoy all of the magical creatures and objects Chance has created, the story really didn't keep my interest this time around. Cassie is a good heroine-even though she does not want the job she manages to save a lot of people. But I am really disappointed in the romance. I think there was a lot of potential there but it kind of fell flat. I really wanted to like this series, but I think I'm giving up.\n\nAnswer:",

Terrific !! Let's face it, what we want to hear in this piece of music is (as in the Tannhauser Overture) the coda building up to the soaring finale where the measure of the performance is how much intensity can the conductor pull from the orchestra in these critical moments. In this performance Maazel stretches out the climb, suspends it at the top of scale, and the descent to the bottom of the scale where he holds the orchestra to the limits of your emotion before releasing it into the final seconds. This may be the best Flying Dutchman Overture I've heard.\n\nAnswer:",

Even in his seventies, he still sings and comminicates each song he sings. My lady and I saw him live last year. I am now eagerly searching for the rest of the CD's to match all of the classic Mathis vinyl that I own.

Throw away the tea ball or strainers and get one of these, you'll be happy you did. I use mine several times a day to enjoy the relaxing and health benefits of tea.\n\nAnswer:",

He does say that since it's a spinner ring, you can't get a solid grip on it to twist it off (he likes his rings to fit snug). So it got stuck on his finger a couple times and he hasn't worn it since. I have owned spinner rings before and I never had the problem that he had, but I also have smaller fingers.

I am not a professional chef just trying to act like one. I am left handed explaining why I got a left handed knife LOL. I will say this knife is very very sharp it will slice a potato as if it was butter. My only issue and it maybe cause I have not used it often enough. Is it pulls to the middle of the potato as if it was a right handed knife. The knife does not seem to have a one sided blade so maybe I was holding it wrong.

All of the girls and their parents, irene, peter,.When i was in the middle of the book i started thinking all guys were like the ones in this book. i started to question the men in my life and my position as a young women.At the end i was majorly shocked that nothing happened to Irene and that she just kept doing this to the club at school, and that Jane ended up in a mental hospital.!!!! wow.

These partisan, biased, and bigoted attitudes are not going to help anyone who really cares about making someone fall in love with them. I would never date anyone with these attitudes. Personally I think male bashing comes from women who feel inferior to men anyway. The only people I would recommend this book to are women with low self-esteem.

The reason I bought this unit was to avoid creating more noise (BK80D makes zapping noise). It does succeed in trapping small flying insects, just not enough. I see the \"swarm\" of insects around it, so the blacklight and octenol must be effective at drawing them in. I suspect the failure is the fan isn't strong enough to suck them in (evidence is little moths able to fly in/out and around it without getting trapped). I am ecstatic with the Flowtron BK80D - its a lean mean killing machine in comparison (piles and piles of insects fall to the ground). This unit barely got a handful after 2 months of continuous operation (and diligent octenol replacement). Sorry Flowtron, but this one is a miss!Pros:Quiet operationEasy to cleanCons:Not very effective at sucking insects in\n\nAnswer:",

An everday, or as Homi would say, \"colloquial\" vocabularly would sufficiently articulate his thesis, yet he seems hellbent on packing his work with obscure language like he needs show off or prove something.

The only complaint I could possibly have is that there is a small hole on the bottom of the tumbler (in the rubber non-skid foot bit) that can retain water and then release it at an inapprpriate moment. It doesn't really leak or drip (this hole), but when I sat it on my desk, I kept wondering where the water ring was coming from.That having been said, the only other suggestion I could have is that the snapping lid (that makes it spill-proof, but not drip-proof) fit more snugly. Other than these two relatively minor issues, it's a great tumbler. It keeps my coffee hot (I haven't tried out cold on it,yet), cleans easily and looks great. It gets jostled quit a bit during my morning commute, but doesn't spill (it hasn't been knocked to the floorboards, yet, traffic isn't that rough.)Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a high-quality travel cup that keeps things hot for quite some time, this is your best bet.\n\nAnswer:",

It teaches about many different features in Publisher that I didn't even know existed. However, don't spend the money if you don't use Publisher much. ...You can learn how to design all sorts of print materials... you can even post what you have designed in Publisher on websites... I think that is one of the nicer features. The instructions in the book are very easy to understand and give you step-by-step instruction for working hands-on on your computer.\n\nAnswer:",

It has a great loud white noise sound (waterfall) and travels beautifully. The two major drawbacks, though, and the reasons I'll be replacing them for something different: 1) after a year or so of use, it functions poorly - cutting in and out at times, 2) in a power outage, the sound machine goes out but then when the power comes back on, it goes back on to its default - chirping birds! So we're desperately running around trying to flip it back to waterfall so our kids don't wake up. I've finally found a machine now that reverts to battery when the power goes out (often in our neck of the woods) - Sound Oasis sound therapy - it's more expensive, but worth it, I think. But overall, the Homedics is a great machine for the price if your power doesn't go out often :)\n\nAnswer:",

They see nothing (nihil?), and they are very unhappy about it. All thru the book.

However from my boat it works great it can shoot the the hull on some boats and ice when ice fishing which is a very good feature. so if your looking for a fish finder for ice or your boat then maybe consider this one but from the shore dont waste your money cause mine stay in my cabinet not my tackle box\n\nAnswer:",

I was skeptical at first because of a few bad reviews concerning the food caught in the pour spout. So far I haven't had problems with that. I wash all the pieces right after I make juice and use a baby bottle brush to clean all the pieces. I use the nipple cleaner end of the brush to clean the spout that is \"hard to clean\". It works just fine. The motor is very good and the pulp is not too wet. It's very easy to pull apart, clean, and put it back together. The only thing that is an issue for me is the pulp trap is internal and I prefer it on the outside. The blade is strong and sharp, but the screen seems somewhat flimsy. It's shape is a bit awkward so it could take up a bit of space. Besides that i think it's a great buy for the price.\n\nAnswer:",

He states that there was a \"bombing\" or \"strafing\" by the Japs, but he gives no further detail.

My canopy is also crooked. I have tried several times to fix that.The bike is also very hard to turn. I have to really push down on it to turn a simple corner or just bare to the right a bit.

He transports you back to early Soviet Russia in grainy black and white that makes you feel as you are watching a movie from that time frame. The actors are great, impeccably carrying out the famous roles that are dear to every Russian. Bulgakov created a literary classic in this tale about a doctor who transforms a dog into a man with darkly amusing consequences. Meanwhile, you see the soviet system closing in around Dr. Preobrazhensky, who has no time for it as he tries to keep his foul-mouthed new creation reined in. But, Poligraph Poligraphovich is as elusive as the mongrel he was created from and finally Dr. Preobrazhensky has no choice but to terminate his experiment. This is satire at its best, a film that is every bit as good as the novel. One can only hope that the film will be made available soon.\n\nAnswer:",

I enjoyed the humor of ST 1, and there's only a nod in that direction here - so lame, it only serves to draw attention to its absence.Also, this turns into a slasher flick - a systematic knock-off of each of the characters and an exploration of how gruesome the special effects can be. Now, I'm not necessarily against this, though I don't really care for slasher flicks, other than to say that it becomes super BO-RING! And I do mean boringThere's not even really a \"B\" movie quality here that provides something memorable. Nope - nothing redeeming here. Don't bother -\n\nAnswer:",

It was easy to get into, the characters likable enough, and the plot slowly (especially in the middle) developing. However, the last 20 or so pages Fielding decided to throw the reader into a loop of unpredictability and confusion...there being only slight, slight hints of anything pointing towards such an unbelievable twist. I think Fielding took excess liberties as the author and had a really good time writing this story, but unfairly put the reader into a spot I don't think I'd want to venture again. And for all you fans of happy endings...don't expect to read \"Whispers and Lies\" and gain any sort of peaceful, satisfying resolution. It's just not here.\n\nAnswer:",

Looking spectacular in her bridesmaid's dress, Toni had a radiance about her whichy Byrne found increasingly hard to resist. Surely one wedding couldn't lead to another?

I think that to shoot a screenplay like this one, there should be at least 200 million dolars available, instead of the low budget this movie got... Let's see why:The plot is about a HUGE war between China / United States / \"THe Latins\" VERSUS EUROPEAN UNION. THis alone would deserve expert special effects.THere's also special effects when Satan appears. There's world wide caos going on.Also, the movie spans a fifty-years period of time...The good point is to see that people still give leading roles to old actors. Michael York (one of the co-producers) is strong some kind of spiritual and political leader. David Hedison surprised me. He's still strong (I was always a fan of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA). Michael Biehn's career is going downhill since, whatever the reasons, he is not included anymore in James Cameron's projects, but here he tries his best.Anyway, altough a pretentious one, this movie is plain funny.\n\nAnswer:",

All of the things that I found appealing about the first DOA were not included with the second one. No extra costume changes that I've been able to find. Nothing to unlock after beating the game, and the endings are pretty weak at best. I even bought the \"official book\" from Prima that stated \"All Secret Characters Revealed!\"...well, I've read through the book and there aren't any. To sum up, the gameplay is great and the environments are beautiful, and Jann Lee still reverses everything you throw at him and beats you up quickly.

Too bad such a nice design could not have been supplied a tad more costly but usable. Stamped/inscribed or permanent labels used to be found on even cheap keyboards, so this is a new low in manufacturing, and just not acceptable in keyboards. It shouuld not be sold (I'll just discard my second one kept for a backup though never used and new in box).You can feel that the labels are only painted on and not stamped into the keys by feeling with fingertips how they are raised slightly above the surface, and the key surface is not as slick as the harder plastic finishes.

Unfortunately, in both books, Eoin Colfer needs DRASTIC character development because everyone is so...rigid.\n\nAnswer:",

If that was the only issue, I would recommend these SuperFi 5 Pro earphones. But the deal killer here is the cord. To allow the user to shape the cord over the top and behind the ear, there is a flexible wire in the cord. It's a good idea, but poorly executed. I've had to replace the cord twice in 18 months (they run $20 plus tax/shipping). If you plan on using the small aluminum carrying case to carry it around while traveling, those wires will be bending all the time. And don't look for any sympathy from Ultimate Ears (now Logitech) if they break right after the end of the one year warranty. If you buy these earphones, plan on spending money on periodic cord replacement.For these reasons I can't recommend this product.\n\nAnswer:",

Wick burns out faster, but is longer. Chews through flints faster. Obviously cheaper construction, thinner metal, sharp edges, rattles. My sparker has gotten really crappy after only 4 flint changes.Thoughts: Get a Zippo, they are better built lighters and have a lifetime warranty. If you need to light a pipe you're not going to be using a petrol fluid lighter, if you're lighting a fire, get some swedish fire steel.\n\nAnswer:",

Simply tilt the box to the right and the litter sifts into the mesh area leaving the clumps with all the \"business\" to fall into the long receptacle. Grasp the protruding handle and slide the receptacle full of dirty litter out and empty it into a trash bag. Slide the receptacle back in, tilt the litter box to the left to allow the clean litter to sift back into the box and you're done. \"No fuss, no muss.\" It all takes about 15-20 seconds and everything remains clean both in appearance and reality.\n\nAnswer:",

These books have been useful on specific subjects but did little to fill in those little holes that made me crazy but I never thought to ask about. This book caused me several times to say to myself, \"Ah, so that's what that's all about\"! I attend mass at least five days a week, teach religious ed., and have served on parish council so I thought I knew everything. Boy, was I wrong and how fun to be set straight so gently. This is not a book to be gulped down in one mouthful; you'd choke on all the information, instead savor it chapter by chapter.

The artists made little figures, with such amazing detail that it allows for facial expressions and movement, and then took more than 140,000 pictures of them to give them movement and life. It makes for a very unusual presentation--neither cartoon nor real people.It appeals to mainly two groups: those looking for an introduction to the opera or story of Hansel and Gretel, and those interested in a movie like Disney's \"Fantasia.\"Oh, I should have said THREE groups: there is also a growing interest in this as a camp movie (like the Rocky Horror Picture Show). Most of this comes as a result of love for the great operatic comedienne, Anna Russell, who was in this production the delightfully camp voice of the witch, Rosina Rubylips.\n\nAnswer:",

Even their #1 hit single \"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\" was their last with Eddie singing lead & Paul taking the bridge. Unfortunately, Paul didn't sing a note in other seven tracks, neither lead nor background. Simply because he was battling depression & alcoholism that ruined both his voice & dance steps. Eddie was singing lead in most of the tracks, like \"Gonna Keep On Trying Til I Win Your Love,\" \"Man,\" and \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\" (better than Undisputed Truth's version). To me, this album had launched Eddie's decision to go solo. Dennis Edwards did contribute on a couple of songs, but the spotlight was on Eddie.\n\nAnswer:",

I used this book along with trancenders q's and I passed the test. The book was very clear and I had no problems understanding it. It wasnt boring, like some certification books are. If a certification book is dull and boring you will have no motivation to read it - this book is the opposite, its an easy read. I reccomend also they you do a fair ammount of practice q's as well, then you will understand what the q's are asking you, and what your expected to know. You may know the answer to the question, but the way the question is worded you think you have no idea.All in all a good book\n\nAnswer:",

It's family-friendly, with nothing really to complain about. But it's also a little bland and forgettable, as much as I hate to say that. In fact, I saw this movie several years ago but forgot almost everything about it as far as plot details. I'll admit that my only interest in it is because John Denver has a starring role, even if it wasn't his one of his best.I couldn't believe it, though, when the opening credits started rolling and just about everyone who had anything to do with the film, including 'Bart the Bear' (the ursine actor who plays the part of \"Walking Thunder\", the grizzly bear in the movie\") was listed before JD! Really?!Again, this is an acceptable family film, but probably will mostly be of interest to fans of John Denver.\n\nAnswer:",

I have read all Dietrich's books and lately he writes about a main character who is in love with an unattainable person and as a result, gets into all kinds of trouble before it comes out all right in the end.Here, a young Roman diplomat joins an embassy to Attila the Hun and ends up as his captive. Naturally there are all kinds of fights and the boy comes of age as a result. The time period is interesting, as are some of the figures in the book, but the story is too much about the trials a tribulations of Jonas, the young insignificant Roman, than of the events occuring around him.\n\nAnswer:",

He forbids her to adopt the octopus for which she has requested, and she returns him to the ocean; but then escalates the excitement when she finds a dinosaur and leads him homeward on a leash.There's not much substance to this story, but it's told in a pleasing limerick-y fashion, and the ridiculousness of the exotic pets wreaking havoc in an ordered home has a rather elemental appeal.\n\nAnswer:",

I bought this toy at my local Walmart for $20 and it isn't even worth that much let along, $70+. I'll give it some credit, it looks pretty good in robot mode and he is pretty posable, but it's when or if you can get back into truck mode, I don't know maybe I got a defective one, but when you have to transform him into truck mode, it's like pulling teeth. I simply could not get his hood and the second half of his body to line up correctly, leading me to throw it against the wall. I'm normally very patient with my transformers but this one just blew my mind. What really gets me is how simple his transformation really is, but yet I couldn't get mine to work.

The author didn't have enough faith in her story-telling ability to simply tell a great story instead of pretending that it was worse than it was. It was a terrible hurricane, yes. It was not, however, the worst hurricane ever. The reader can tell that she did some research on hurricanes in general, yet she makes not a single mention of the 1900 Galveston hurricane in which over 6000 people perished. It is impossible for her not to know about Galveston; in fact, I have an ungenerous hunch that she modeled this book after Isaac's Storm, Erik Larsen's account of the Galveston hurricane. Minor quibble: Her insistence on giving the storm a catchy name, \"GH38\", is grating.On the plus side, I did like the way she connected the storm to the great Depression on one side and World War II on the other.\n\nAnswer:",

You get what you pay for with these stands. Obviously, the price can't be beat. One of the bases came chipped up and scratched and definitely grounds for a return, but I didn't want to deal with the hassle, so just used that stand for one of my rear speakers where the base would be hidden anyway. As for the speaker compatibility, if you bought these for the Polk RM6750 speakers, it will not be a perfect fit. Expect to make some modifications to the stands themselves if you'd like the speakers to sit flush, otherwise there will be some movement and play. Finally, the screws supplied with these stands do not fit the Polk speakers. You will need to go to a hardware store and purchase 1/4-20 screws. Annoying/inconvenient. Overall though, these are good stands for the price if you can look past its flaws.\n\nAnswer:",

Although I found myself comparing it to Ratt because of the voice of Stephen Pearcy, I had to point out some differences. Any Ratt fan would love to have this one. \"Nothin' to Lose\" sounds like a typical Ratt song to me and I love it! However another favorite of mine is \"Cry no more\", a ballad!! \"Mother Blues\" is a acoustic and a little bluesy which is obvious from the title. In my opinion every song on this cd is well worth the listening. Hats off to a group who can make entertaining music without the use of four letter words. It's called talent. I can't stop listening to it. I'd highly reccomend this for any collection, especially for Ratt fans!!\n\nAnswer:",

I wanted the an alarm that would wake me up to the radio and this is only an alarm sound. I found a station that came in sort of clear ( a very close station ) when I came back in the room it wouldnt pick the station up. I have a few other radios and they pick up a lot better than this. NWS comes in ok but I am unsure if it picks up all the alerts it hasnt went off yet and we have had bad weather. I wish I would of paid more and got another CC Radio.\n\nAnswer:",

I put it in our older computer, and it finally connected after about 2 phone calls to technical support, and an upgrade to the drivers. But then, my fast dsl internet was going slower than dial up when using the card. After many more calls to technical support, and stuff they told me to do which i did, the card still did not make my internet or network file sharing fast. it was not the phones or anything like either. I decided to switch the card to another pc, which i didnt really want being in there, but now it works fine! I dont reccomend this product, because it may not work on your pc like it didnt for one of mine, but i was lucky to have it working later on a different pc AT ALL. look elsewhere if you plan to go wireless, such as Linksys, whos routers and cards have never failed me.\n\nAnswer:",

The basic structure of the game is virtually identical, but the major difference is the lack of fun. There is no sense of humor and no cool videos. And the competing races are not at all memorable. Without these elements of entertainment I very quickly felt like I was just reverse engineering a computer program.Also there are holes in the playability of the game. Several times I got stuck in a state where I had no resources to do anything and I just sat there turn after turn with nothing happening, waiting to be overwhelmed by other teams. It was not at all clear what I had done wrong.Good concept and technically sophisticated. Just not fun.\n\nAnswer:",

What you probably wanna know is, \"Are these songs any good?\" Well, in my opinion, yeah! First of all, the opening track, Johnny Appleseed is catchy as hell. It could easily be a hit on the radio. (Although no radio station will ever play it) And the electronica inspired Cool'n'Out is as rock'n'roll as any Clash tune. I also like Bhindi Bhagee, Gamma Ray, and Mondo Bongo.

I researched to make sure the packaging pictured on Amazon was the actual packaging for the dvd set- it was, so I placed my order. It just arrived yesterday, but instead of a boxed set with an episode guide, it's a black dvd case with 2 plastic trays inside to hold all 4 dvds. No episode guide, just the season 3 slipcover. It looks like someone put this together out of their home. I recognize I got a great deal, but if Amazon is not actually selling me the boxed set, then that information should be specified somewhere- I would have paid a little more to get the actual product instead of a homemade knock-off.\n\nAnswer:",

There's the smooth (The Dionne Warwick/Bacharach/David Canon is superbly represented here), the girl group sound (Shirelles), the rough (gospelled-up soul of Maxine Brown and Chuck Jackson), the garage (The Kingsmen) and the cheeze (BJ Thomas). Discs one and two are both stellar, but the chronologically-ordered set gradually goes to pot towards the end, with BJ (possibly the least coolest singer ever) blathering and crooning his way through some of the '70s worst pop sludge. Still, this set is worth it simply because the first two discs are quite good, and Maxine Brown's previously unreleased take on \"Baby Cakes\" on the third disc will simply blow you away.

The first three or four songs are sweeping guitar pop symphonies outrageous in their poppy pathos. Pernice, indeed, sounds quite a bit like the smooth, seductive Colin Bluntstone throughout these songs--a fact I never noticed during his days on Scud Mountain. The fifth song will cause Wilco to tear their hair out and hire Jeff Lynne. Though his lyrics are lachrymose and morbid, they are so admittedly (\"this fascination with the moribund\"), and there's a great sense of fun in that. The only missteps here are one or two ballads (Shaken Baby is one), with gross jazzy chords tipping the mood into maudlin. Pernice can write this stuff in his sleep and it bogged down his Scud Mountain stuff, too.Thom Monihan's production is stellar, crisp and full throughout: Pernice's distinct vocals swoon atop layers of guitar, piano, organ, and strings. Extremely tasty. This record was a real surprise.\n\nAnswer:",

Once the story started to move, I enjoyed it and have decided it was worth the effort to finish it...\n\nAnswer:",

I know that the book was (and is) a wildly popular bestseller, but I have to confess that the thought that kept nagging at me as I listened was why? I'm not saying this is a bad book. It is somewhat engaging. However, I didn't find any of the characters particularly vivid or humanly multi-dimensional. And as soon as Rosie the elephant was added to the circus, halfway through the book, I had a (correct) feeling as to where the plot line was moving, so no surprise ending. I have no idea whether circus life in the prohibition era was anything like this, so can't comment on the authenticity of the backdrop, but I found it pretty depressing. Altogether, a pretty so-so read.\n\nAnswer:",

I bought these because I thought they'd let me study in a cafe or cancel out the sound of a TV. They don't. They're no more effective at cancelling those noises than my regular headphones.

While Gabriel Yared's score for The English Patient was dramatic and brilliant, his score for City of Angels is less interesting. Also on the list is \"Iris\" by the Goo Goo Dolls. The Bad: Jimi Hendrix (Great guitarist, but not a great work), John Lee Hooker (Haven't heard much of his music, not that great), Jude (Boring and pointless), Eric Clapton (A great guitarist. This song is upbeat, yet slow). The Good: Peter Gabriel is back in prime form with \"I Grieve\" (Smooth and stylistic). Sarah McLachlan (Not my favorite artist, but I could stand to listen to this one). Paula Cole (Her songs get old after awhile and this may, too, but for now it's fresh). U2 starts the album off with a stylistic peice that almost bookends with Gabriel's. The best on the album, however, is \"Uninvited\" by Alanis Morissette. If the song is heard well enough in the film, look for a possible Oscar nomination in March.\n\nAnswer:",

A history piece presented by 21-st century men. The film failed to show customs and cruelty of early 18 century. Some parts are really lengthy and dull with no meaningful impact on action. Binoche is sailing around in her skirts without showing open passion either to her husband (except the unnecessary and out of taste nude scene) or to the murderer. Seems that she only pretends that she really cares about the guys. I guess she just looks for a strange way to escape thoughts about hanging herself because of boring island life. I have a feeling that the whole \"male\" cast (mostly unknown actors) is poking around Binoche. Her suppose-to-be husband and that other guy are of no match to her as actors. If you are up to a real character played by Binoche you better stick to films where a) she plays with great names as Fiennes and b) she plays less morbid character.\n\nAnswer:",

The dialogue between Holmes and Moran in THE EMPTY HOUSE is a faithful transcription of what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle actually wrote. The first three years of this series produced some outstanding episodes and THE EMPTY HOUSE is one of the best. It's beautifully directed and well written. Edward Hardwicke is excellent as the new Watson and Jeremy Brett is fascinating to watch, and even more fascinating to listen to. There is an amusing pastiche sequence at the start which takes place in the coroner's court. It nicely rounds out this story without padding it. The supporting players, particularly the excellent Colin Jeavons and Rosalie Williams, work well as an ensemble.

The British commanded by Colonel Bogey, played by Alec Guiness ( An amazing performance I might add) try to defy the rule of the Japaneese commodant who commands the prison camp. The Japaneese order the prisoners to construct a bridge over the river Kwai to provide troop transport for the Imperial Japaneese Army. Bogy refuses, and a large fued ignites. All in all, a wonderful film, but it does not hold for as long as intended.\n\nAnswer:",

Based on interviews of Truman by Merle Miller in preparation for an anticipated television series, it is expressed, largely, in Truman's own words. As such, it is as Truman saw himself and the world.Arranged chronologically, the reader is taken through this remarkable life, the challenges Truman faced and his views on issues and personalities. On these pages we read Truman's uncensored opinions on MacArthur, Ike, Marshall and generals in general, Dean Atcheson, Richard Nixon, the presidency and a host of other topics. Here we learn his conviction that the U. S. has never had a crooked president and that \"The only thing new is the history you don't know.\"There are other, better, first biographies to learn the facts of Truman's life. Turn to \"Plain Speaking\" to meet Harry Truman.\n\nAnswer:",

His guitar playing sizzles but is restrained and not over the top and his vocals are pleasant and easy listening. Cummings release is mostly original with two covers, Willie Dixon's \"Hoochie Coochie\", Robert Johnson's \"Crossroads\" and the blues standard, \"Mojo Working\" all performed very well. To me, the original material works much better for Cummings than tunes like \"Crossroads\" which have been done time and again by blues musicians everywhere. That is a small knock for this otherwise fine disc. Best tracks, \"The Long Way\" and \"Lonely Bed\", both original, slow to medium tempo, excellent guitar and strong vocals.\n\nAnswer:",

Replacing their numbers with their names and faces, she describes each of these women with sensitivity and compassion, reminding readers of their humanity and desperation. On the other hand, Rule treats Gary Ridgeway, who was jokingly labeled \"Green River Gary\" by co-workers after police first questioned him, with clinical objectivity. There is nothing new here: a psychologically empty man with no conscience exerts the ultimate form of power over a series of victims who are the symbols rather than the sources of his pain.

This is a leaner, meaner Bond film, devoid of humor, and with a truly nasty drug lord as a villain, well played by Robert Davi. There's also a tough Bond girl (Carey Lowell) who has to compete for attention with the villain's girl (Talisa Soto). One thing I couldn't understand: Lowell's character is portrayed as tough and independent, yet at times, she's whining that she doesn't get enough attention from ol' James.The biggest problem is Dalton. Like The Living Daylights (which is the worst Bond film ever), Dalton is dry, and displays none of the class, style, or sly humor which Connery, Moore, or even Brosnan have displayed. This isn't a bad thriller, and the action sequences are terrific, but I can't say I was sorry that this was Dalton's last turn as Bond.\n\nAnswer:",

Without studio magic, Maines' voice sounds nasally and unimpressive. It's clear she doesn't have the pipes of a Martina McBride or a Tricia Yearwood.This offering lacks the spunk that the band has marketed itself with in the past. All in all, it's not like Johnny at San Quentin or Garth live.This CD shows the limits of hype. The Chicks, not to be confused with real songwriters, give lackluster performances live. This collection shows that the songs aren't their own. It might as well be a demo album with stock cheering added.Hype suggested that the Chicks had crafted a career that would last for decades. This collection does much to refute the early promise.Who knows? Maybe after falling off the Earth, Branson will discover them in thirty years.\n\nAnswer:",

This is primarily an opinion on features. I bought mine used on Amazon. Great money saver and I git a flawless copy. This is a great study bible. I use mine for my men's group at church, and for on the go reading and vacations. Anyhow, the footnotes are invaluable. Simply worded, they help me understand what I don't comprehend on my own, often relating scripture in more contemporary terms. This is most helpful for Old Testament reading. As in say, Deuteronomy, or Leviticus. The concordance, and intro to the books has also helped aid me in my studies. I like the NLT best for the translations ability to eliminate complexity and provide explanation. My one complaint is, there's no built in book marker, so I keep a prayer card to mark my spot, not really s big deal. All in all a great bible.\n\nAnswer:",

Good for you, Robert, but maybe you should read the book BEFORE you agree to put your name on it.This was my first experience with the co-authored book. I've seen the Tom Clancy and Nelson DeMille co-authored series too, and I've always been a little wary. My suspicions have now been confirmed. This book was a quick read, predictable as anything, and could be grasped by your average 3rd grader. Philip Shelby kept the audience in complete suspense by waiting until the 4th chapter to identify the conspirators to us. About halfway through the book you knew what the evil plan was and you knew how it was going to end.My expectations for a Robert Ludlum book have been set way too high to try and pass this garbage off as his work.\n\nAnswer:",

Police Detective John Rebus is a rounded human character, and Edinburgh makes a colorful backdrop to his stories, which are generally well plotted. However, \"In Black and Blue,\" Rankin was just a little too ambitious. There are enough plots and subplots for five books, and he isn't always deft at juggling them. I often found myself scratching my head and flipping back pages to remember who a particular character was (there are a dozen major police characters alone). This is a major distraction in a mystery novel, which should be read full steam ahead. The plot strands involve gangsters, drug dealers, rogue cops, the oil trade, and two (count them two) serial killers. The denouement of all this is far from satisfying: the strands don't come together as neatly as a reader would have wished.I'm still high on Rankin, but I wish he had turned this one into two separate novels (perhaps \"Black\" and \"Blue\").\n\nAnswer:",

Chapter 3 is where it should start getting interesting, and although the topic \"unconscious parenting\" is a good one, there is too darn much fluff.Getting the Love You Want was short and to the point. I think this book, Giving the Love that Heals, could have been 1/3 the length of what it is. We are a busy people, and shouldn't have to put up with writing that says nothing.

Ummm, I'm no dummy but I wouldn't call this a rasp. I was expecting a some sort of a serrated or rough edge that would work well for rasping the edge of the drywall. Best I could find that might be a rasp was the straight, somewhat sharp edge. But, problem solved with a $5 drywall rasp from Home Depot. No harm, no foul.But all that being said, as a kicker style drywall lifter it worked great. I was able to drywall my entire basement by myself using this tool. Sure makes it a LOT easier to get that bottom edge off the floor with this tool. It's lightweight and appears to be strong. I didn't have the problem the other reviewer had with it breaking but I could see how it might if you put a lot of force on it. It appears to be made from cast alluminum which could snap. But, be careful and use it for its intended purpose and I'm sure it will do a good job for you.\n\nAnswer:",

The major premise is that when we are disappointed in our actions, we often will then modify our perceptions in order to make us feel better.Get through those first 100 pages with a lot of self-reflection and you will then find tools to improve your relationships.

I gave it a 1-star because it was at least green.I know what fluorescent green looks like; I've used them for years to highlight my programs, but despite the labeling, they are just plain simple green... no bright, neon, leaps out at you green. And they are so dark they interfer with the underlieing text.First the marker makers stopped making true fluorescent ORANGE, a really useful marker, replacing it with something more a \"dull pumpkin\", now the fluorescent GREEN is going too??

Basically if your in high school, this calculator is more than you need. Im in college algebra in 10th grade and I'm not allowed to use it in class. The TI-89 contains a computer algebra system where you don't have to do any of the work. You just press the \"solve(\" key, type in the problem then \",x\" or whatever other variable your working with and it does the whole problem for you. This is the same as cheating because it doesn't show the work just gives the answer. That's why its not allowed in most high school math classes. Also, the TI-89 is not allowed on the ACT so don't just buy it so you can cheat to get a good score. Ok i'm bein a little unfair. The TI-89 is an excellent calculator, one of the best i've ever seen. I just recommend it for 12th grade and up.\n\nAnswer:",

When the paper gets low (fewer than about 20 pieces left in the tray) it always jams. Always. Often it pulls more than one piece of paper at a time, no matter what kind of paper I try to use. The fax portion hardly ever works properly, especially if I try to fax more than a couple of pages. The paper jams in that end also, about 4 out of every 5 times. I have torn my hair out of my head with this printer. I just tried to send a fax 6 times, it jammed every time. The fax was only 10 pages. The funny thing is that my previous printer was also an HP (6110) and I had similar problems. I don't know why I gave HP a second chance. I will never buy another HP all-in-one.

Well Sarah Michell, does not have a tremendous voice, it is very far from bad. SHe delivers her verses with good clarity and emotion. Amber Benson is definately the best singer in the cast, followed by Emma Caulfield and Tony Head. Jamnes Marsters is disapoinitng, since he is one of the 2 professional singers on the show.

There seems to be this awkward juxtaposition between the mystery story line and the personal story line which doesn't jive at all. I got the impression Lanyon wrote a novel about Adrien and then threw in murder just so it could be called a mystery. There are time line issues which, when you think about them, make you question \"just how long ago did that happen?\" Adrien, himself, is a problem. I didn't think he was very likable, everything seems to make him whine and complain. In fact, the only time he comes across as mildly pleasant is when he's had too much to drink. Of course, this may have been a prelude to issues in the fourth mystery, but at this point I don't really care.\n\nAnswer:",

So I thought I\"d check out another of Zooey's works. Unfortunately \"500 days\" is a rewrite of the age-old \"belle dame sans merci\" with a few strokes of color and music for added interest. \"Summer\" is a cold, distant, yet exciting young woman who easily captures the misguided passion of Gordon-Levitt's character. As she sends him mixed signals, he becomes more smitten, until she suddenly breaks up with him. The end has a redeeming twist in which Tom realizes that he wasn't exactly the attentive lover that Summer needed, and their chemistry wasn't all that perfect either. Save for that flash of clarity, the rest of the movie is a sickening ride through the angst of unrequited love, which I didn't particularly enjoy. I'll be sticking to Deschanel's more flesh-and-blood, lovable character \"Jess\"!\n\nAnswer:",

But what do you expect from Tales from the Darkside. \"Lot 249\" is a staid run of the mill mummy story with a corny ending. \"Cat From Hell\" stiff and with awful props. \"Lovers Vow\" this one is pretty decent. Interesting story line, pretty faces, and a a plot which isn't 100% predictable. In the wraparound story Debbie Harry is as buetiful as ever and for a Debbie Harry fan like me her brief appearances make this worthwhile.\n\nAnswer:",

In cleaning mode, the Optifix Pro leaves a hazy film on the disc, with radial swirl patterns, that I have not been able to remove. An effective cleaner should leave a disc shiny and bright, free of haze. According to Memorex, this haze is caused by the pads and solution and can be wiped off -- but I wasn't able to wipe it off. I would have to call this product UNACCEPTABLE, and I am returning it for a refund. I guess I'll have to pick up one of the Maxell cleaners; they're poorly made of cheap plastic, but at least they clean a disc effectively and feature reusable pads...\n\nAnswer:",

For a supposed military sci-fi adventure, there are few actual battle scenes. Try Old Man's War or The Ghost Brigades- they both leave Starship Troopers in the intergalactic dust.\n\nAnswer:",

Her high-pitched, moody vocals are always compelling. This 1991 recording represented a shift in her career: that's when she decided to leave her usual label to be able to sing what she really wanted and the way she wanted, with much more restrained arrangements than before: here just piano, cello, charango and percussion. And the result is really great, since Zizi's voice is so melodic that it doesn't need much orchestration. The repertoire ranges between heartfelt ballads and more raucous rhythms. Some of the best cuts are the exquisite cover of Chico Buarque's \"Eu te amo\" and her very personal version of \"Com que roupa\", a Brazilian classic from the 20s.\n\nAnswer:",

The swing arrived in a timely manner, but when I got the parts out and started to put is together, I discovered that the top bar was the wrong part. That's when the trouble started. I had trouble contacting Hatteras Hammocks Customer Service, (it took them a couple of day to respond by e-mail, and their 800 phone number was not functioning properly), but once I did get a service rep, a replacement part was sent out (it took about a week to arrive). Unfortunately, my visitors had come and gone by that point. However, with the correct part, assembly was fairly easy and fast, and the swing is *very* comfortable as well as attractive.

With the wheels it's also hard to store this on the shelf with their other toys, so if I were to do it again I would go with a wooden block set and then buy a better-designed wagon separately.

I must have just gotten a faulty one since I didn't see others report that issue. However, the whole design is also not really appropriate either, it has a very heavy thick metal yet its supposed to clamp onto a delicate telescope eyepiece. Also its not really designed with modern cameras in mind because I would have had to adjust the elevation to the very maximum to be able to center my Nikon coolpix on it. Its kind of clunky too, not a precision instrument. If I could redesign it I'd make the entire frame a lighter yet sturdy plastic and have it more precise in its adjustments.

Come on Stevie, the crowdcame to hear you. He didn't do this 7 years ago. I believe that the death of his mother two yearsago has greatly changed his slant towards music and performing. The audience sings on half of his songs,while he simply plays along. That is not the Stevie Wonder that I know.

The only two making them now seems to be Maxell and Sony. Been using Maxell for a couple years now and read several reviews that felt these 120 minute Sony's were the better of the two. I didn't find that to be the case. They are certainly no better. In fact the sound quality is not as good as Maxell and the Sony \"clicks and ticks\" while running. We do listen to a lot of soft, quiet music so it's more noticable and more of an annoyance for us. But the Maxell's do this also so that \"beef\" is just a wash. It's not a deck problem either as the clicking is still there whether it's being played in my JVC, Teac, Technics, or either of my Pioneers.So they are just OK and because we are so limited now as to brands to choose from, we must accept it.Thanks,MR\n\nAnswer:",

Half of the movie about what the psycho thinks that the FBI agent played by Demi Moore does not have enough time to resolve the main question - who the killer was. The only dicovery she makes is that it is not who she thought. It is one of those movies that you think they finished in the middle. It has some good sceens and I personally liked Demi's performance. The funny thing was how Demi got her first and the only suspect - by pure intuition she was so sure about it. My objection is that the movie is not that much about investigation, but it is about the way the psychos think, this is what the movie promotes.\n\nAnswer:",

However, there is a huge paradox tied up with this book. If you don't know how to read at a higher level, you won't get anything out of this book because you won't be able to connect with a lot of the information presented. If you do read well (and by this, i mean are not a complete moron) then this book is a huge waste of time and you will really learn nothing. The best thing I learned from this book offered another paradox. It says to learn to recognize books that are not worth your time and effort and do not give them that effort.

We all have skeletons in our closets.\" How true!She saw the white fella on the horse and thought she had a wonderful chance to be happy. But he wasn't the fella on the white horse, he was the wolf in sheep's clothing. It took a lot of guts for her to come out with the story. She could have sold out to the tabloids but she didn't.

Because I like this world so I wanted a well rounded feel. So that Ronnie was back (a little) was nice. That Richard seemed to be dealing more was nice. That Anita was not as judgemental and seemed to be growing up and becoming an adult was nice. Change is good.There are so many characters at this point that I really can't care about all of them. Maybe, as the reader - from Anita's POV, I'm not supposed to though. More edittig could have gone into this, however. At points there was a lot of repeat writing, which I guess can be excused because it's in Anita's head but... lord. And EVERY guy was just SO impressed by her. She was just so great in bed. Good for her, but she must not be somebody's type.Oh well. Still liked visitting the world. Still miss Edward. Still think her harem of men should be trimmed down just a bit.\n\nAnswer:",

The previews for The Ladykillers made it look like a charming, Southern US, caper film. Sure enough, there were plenty of grey-haired folks in the theatre. I can't imagine they expected the constant MF swearing from one of the chracters.This is a remake of the 1955 hit UK film of the same name starring Peter Sellers and Alec Guiness. The new version relies on repetitive gag humour and the clash between a conservative Christian woman and a foul-mouthed, \"hippity-hop\" criminal, to get most of its laughs. Some of the other supporting cast members are nothing but dumb cliches (big, dumb jock, quiet, sly Communist Chinese General, etc.) Tom Hanks plays the role of ring leader as if he were a cartoon character.There's really no intrigue or really good humour in this obvious Cohen Brothers sellout.

The book starts with samurai in feudal Japan failing his master and becoming ronin (wandering and masterless) before a climactic encounter with the demon who slew his master. Then the book flashes forward to a dystopian 21st-century New York where the streets are rubble ruled by gangs, and ghouls rule beneath the streets. The ronin and demon's story is carried on in the context of a a giant corporation involved in bio-technology.

Perhaps if the role of Frank Cross, the modern Scrooge, would have been portrayed by other actor, the movie wouldn't have been so entertaining, and that is the sign of a good actor.

It worked well for the most part. But every once in a while I got problems with connection, for which I had to call customer support.Now suddenly it has become a big pain ... Both wired and wireless connections drop every 10 mins because router reboots itself. I have made over a dozen calls to tech support, but the problem has remained.The other thing is that D link tech support always tells you to go with basic 802.11b config with no encryption ( the most they would let me do was WEP, and always turned down WPA ). So even though this router has a lot of cool features ( super G, WPA, gaming mode etc. etc. ) , you are not allowed to use any of them. That is because if you try and it does not work, tech support will always tell you to turn all of them off. Thus all I have is a powerful router being used as basic 802.11b.\n\nAnswer:",

I can understand the wide range of reviews here on Amazon. I'm sort of neutral to the whole album.I enjoyed the slower beats on the cd, but that's not what I was expecting to get. Actually some of the actual music on the album is quite majestic, moving and sweeping. It's that sort of epic dreamy dance that sounds so beautiful.If the whole album were like that with minimal vocalists, I'd love it. However, the other reviewers are correct: there does seem to be too many vocals. Markus' music is strong enough to where he doesn't need that many vocals.He's a tremendous producer and the music on here shows it. The vocals were ok for me (I can't say I disliked them, but I definitely did not love them). So overall a three-star release. Maybe worth a Used purchase but definitely not the full retail.\n\nAnswer:",

It's my second digital camera, and after a fair amount of research into small 3.2MP models, I bought it before a two-week vacation that culminated in a wedding. On the trip, I took some 350 pictures and also made a few short videos. When the camera works, it works very well, but I found that it was almost impossible to get it to focus in low light, i.e., lighting where a flash is needed. Furthermore, after several seconds of pressing the shutter release and having it fail to focus, I'd lower the camera, only to have it focus on the floor and take a picture at that time. I ended up with a lot of pictures of the floor. The video feature works quite nicely, and the various \"scene\" modes do well, too, but when the lighting got tough, this camera gave me nothing but frustration.

It's the story which was a let-down.Asher Lev's artistic and spiritual confusion, aimlessness, and lethargy brought us a dark and mysterious story overall. I felt empathy for the pressure put on Asher by family, the Rebbe, and the community.

After completing this book, I could small talk in Thai with the greatest of ease. Though, I could not have an in depth conversation. Which is why the course is called Thai for Beginners and not Fluent Thai.The only major problem is that this course is very boring. Unless you enjoy spending hours memorizing vocabulary, you will probably find this course a bore.

These are two of the worst purchases I have made EVER!!! Most of the songs are song by people who would have a hard time getting gigs at Holiday Inn lounges. The videos themselves have nothing to do with the lyrics of the songs since the director thinks that all of of the songs can be summarized visually as \"bimbos in cheap bikinis (or other forms of revealing clothing bought at K-Mart). Not that the director could have done much with the actors. The girls look like strippers at a low-class country strip clubs and have the same level of acting ability. The guys look like Sears catalogue models who are either semi-nude or are wearing tacky and cheap cloths and they have the same dopey \"I am posing for the underwear shoot\" expression no matter what they are supposed to be doing in the video.

The graphics are better, the sound is better(although the music isn`t quite as good as the original), the gameplay is greatly improved so that it`ll be enjoyed more by newcomers and experts alike.

By itself quite a feat. However, what truly bugs me is that for the SIX WEEKS before the battery actually went dead, an annoying little icon had been blinking in my taskbar, warning me that the battery is low. It's good to know that in 6 weeks I'll have to replace the battery, but I'd really prefer it if I could switch that icon off. If that wasn't enough, at irregular intervals (sometimes only ONE MINUTE apart) a blue little window (the size of a big stamp) moves into view, ALSO telling me my battery is low.If I'd known this in advance, I wouldn't have bought this keyboard/mouse set.\n\nAnswer:",

Some believe that Jack Ruby's fantasy was to be a gangster and rubbing out Lee Harvey Oswald gave him the opportunity to project that image. Who knows what really happened?

The book also shows howreligious zeal and political activism eventually became so interwoventhat they produced a culture in which one's value is directlyproportioned to the death and destruction one facilitates.

Action and adventure and intrigue, not unlike the chapters in Chabon's Kavlier and Clay where he introduces the Escapist and Luna Moth.Well, I sure didn't find much of that. The only stories that really caught my attention were the Glen David Gold, the Elmore Leonard, and Chabon's own contribution. Neil Gaiman's story was particularly disappointing. It looked like something he tossed together in an afternoon. The mainstream writers should stick to mainstream stuff. That's mostly what they were doing in this anthology, anyway.So, if you want to read good, honest to God genre stuff, take a look at the Year's Best SF and Year's Best Fantasy series edited by David G.

However, the book is more of a general reference of how to model, rig, skin, and create a character rather than animate a character.For example, it covers nothing about making a character move in a believable way, how to use the character controls effectively, or any suggestions on a good animation workflow (such as blocking in, then converting to spline keys).At the end of reading it you will have a fully created and rigged character but still not know how to animate it. The book should have been entitled Maya Character Creation and Rigging instead.That said, the material is very in-depth and nicely presented for what it does cover.

By mixing well-documented facts with his own irrepressible wit (and admitted liberalism), Alterman's book should be required reading for anyone who gives the current state of politics and social policy even a passing thought.I was particularly struck by Alterman's indictment of the corporate power behind the media. The largely unnoticed (and continuing -- see the current attempts by the FCC for even more deregulation) consolidation of the media is one of the more disquieting trends in American culture.

No Thanks for the QUICKIE Mr. Baisden!!!\nText: Been there! Read this before...Mr. Baisden has such great potential; I have followed him from book one. This book has all the makings to be a great story but it is just too quick! I keep visualizing Angela Bassett and Martin Lawrence in a movie similar to this story...This story was just too predictable. I am praying that Mr. Baisden's 'broadening' does NOT affect his writing skills so that he becomes another commercialized-money-generating writer that we already have too many of!

Lots of space to put all your components. I did not feel any restricted due to non-removable MB tray. The documentation was light, could have been a little more detailed. Even though it was my first built, I had little issues using this case.Shipping was FAST. Ordered it on Aug-21 and received it on Aug-23.\n\nAnswer:",

Now (er, 1988, anyway), he runs a general store, and has a boy, Billy. Ed is a widower, but is that an excuse to be an incredibly irresponsible parent? He leaves 7-year old Billy in charge of the store and his dog. Billy is subsequently hit by a motorcycle. Ed comes back to find him on the ground. There is no phone at the store (?!), so Ed picks him up (error), and takes him home (another error) to cure Billy with a damp cloth (huh?). Guess what? The kid up and dies. You know the rest of the story; Ed seeks a decrepit old woman who can conjure up Pumpkinhead for revenge on one guilty kid, and several innocent ones. I know, who ever said horror movies had to be fair? But to be frank, Billy was just a victim of flat-out negligent parenting.\n\nAnswer:",

The movie was made on a pretty low budget, but the lighting and camera work, as in all Orson Welles films, is fantastic. It's a very dark, gloomy, foggy black-and-white look. I especially liked the scenes with the three Weird Sisters, the witches who tell Macbeth of his fate.The acting is, of course, excellent. Welles really understands Shakespeare and he shows it in his performance as Macbeth. Lady Macbeth is also very good, Jeanette Nolan.\n\nAnswer:",
