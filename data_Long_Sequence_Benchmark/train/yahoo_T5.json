Electrical resonance is not generally related to mechanical resonance.  It would be possible, with considerable calculation and inventiveness to put together a device which vibrated in time with or at a harmonic fraction of its electrical resonant frequency, but it would be a real academic undertaking.\\n.  There is no single equation to calculate the resonant frequency of \"an object\".  If you narrowly define the object as say \"a taut string\" or \"a circular plate\", equations of only a few terms can be derived for each of those cases, but the equations would not be the same for different cases.  There would be similarities, but they would have diffent constants and different variables.  Most objects would require the development of a complicated mathematical description of the interelatedness of the masses, elastic properties, dimensions, stiffnesses and coupling mechanics of the various components of the object in order to calculate a resonant frequency.  For some complex objects, which are dominated by a single large and simple structure, like say the cylindrical fuselage of an airplane, there are formulae to calculate the resonant frequency.  For objects like suspension bridges, or cable stayed bridges or skyscrapers, it is necessary to go through the pains of developing a mathematical model to find a range within which the object will resonate.  For most objects, you just build it, test it and then do something to eliminate undesirable resonances.\\n.  Pretty much the same can be said about calculating the electrical resonance of an object.\\n.  For simple resonant circuits there are straightforward formulae for calculating their resonant frequencies, but the formulae are different for different types of resonant circuits.  Whatever text I might have on resonance of electrical circuits is buried in a box somewhere, but should be able to find a book which includes these formuale and other electrical formulae at a college library, online or maybe even at some place like Radio Shack®.\n\nAnswer:",

Theoretically, it makes it harder for the opponent to judge the velocity of the ball.  Normally, the opponent can hear the ball strike the racquet.  And using this audible information, the brain can track and better judge the speed of the ball.  Take away te audio and the opponent now must use visual cues only.\\n\\n(I Think...)\n\nAnswer:",

That night she always took my arm or hand and we also stayed with eachother for the rest of the evening. I did not cross the line with her, as I only held her in my arms until morning. The next day she told me she had such a great time, and we have gone out on what I would consider dates several more times. She continues to go out with me, she has no other male friends or boyfriends, yet she seems to keep her distance when we enter an environment where we could be intimate? Should I move on? Does she just consider me her friend? I have no idea what to do, I am just plain confused and tired of trying to figure this out.\nAnswer: Take it slow.

Go on a hunt with an animal that may be equally as smart as you, The chance you might not make it out alive. It would be such a rush.

Wouldn't it just be fun.\\n\\nWhose with me.\nAnswer: For the last century or more people who otherwise would've been food for some critter haven't been and have reproduced. \\nThe past few years, with bicycle helmets, seat belts, radical surgeries, and so on, many hundreds of millions more who would've simply died from their stupidity have lived and reproduced. They've made more insanely stupid and clueless  people.\\nWe now have record numbers of people too stupid to walk and breathe at the same time. In any other time and place, they'd be critter food.\\nHaving said this, I sometimes think... well... it sounds awful, but I sometimes wonder what the world would be like if people all had to have a certain IQ level or higher or they'd be critter food. \\nSo a hunt doesn't sound as weird as I thought initially.\\nI just have the guts to say so.\n\nAnswer:",

What can I do?\nQuestion: I met my girl about a year ago, we starting hanging out almost everyday calling each other talking forever even before we started going out. This happened for 6 months and finally I worked up the courage to ask her out. Weve been going out for about a month and a half now, officially, 2 unofficially. Weve had our shares of fights before where she claimed she didnt want to be with me, but she ended up with me the next day, and everything being fine again. But now, we had a fight 3 days ago, where some really harsh things came out of her saying I turned my back on her before and that im scum, a waste of her time, etc. Shes had a pretty harsh past where shes been cheated on, and has cheated on people, and most of her friends have turned their backs on her leaving her to deal with everything herself. During these times, i stuck by her, always taking her side we got so close because she said i was the only person she could trust, i was sincere and sweet.\nAnswer: I answered your previous question about this issue and really wanted to send you an e-mail this time but you dont have that option available.  All I can say is she sounds just like me when I was her age and I know exactly what she is going through.  If you ever set up an e-mail contact get back to me and I will try and explain her to you so you can have a better understanding of what is going on.  Most of what people are writing to you is not right.  I dont think anybody can understand it unless they have been through it themselves.  Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

The label World War I or First World War did not come into general use until after the outbreak of World War II in 1939, and until then it was commonly known as the Great War or the World War. The war was fought by the Allied Powers on one side, and the Central Powers on the other, resulting in eventual victory for the Allies. No previous conflict had mobilized so many soldiers or involved so many in the field of battle. By its end, the war had become the bloodiest war in recorded history, though this record was soon to be superseded by World War II.\\n\\nAmongst Western countries, World War I became infamous for trench warfare along the Western Front, involving a system of opposing trenches (separated by a \"No Man's Land\") running from the North Sea to the border of Switzerland. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries' home fronts on account of food shortages and genocide committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts. In World War I, only some 5% of the casualties (directly caused by the war) were civilian - in World War II, this figure approached 50%.\\n\\nUltimately, World War I created a decisive break with the old world order that had emerged after the Napoleonic Wars, as modified by the mid-19th century national revolutions, the processes of European national unification and European colonialism. Three European land empires were shattered and subsequently dismembered to varying degrees: the German, the Austro-Hungarian and the Russian. In the Balkans and the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire experienced the same fate. Three European imperial dynasties, represented by the Hohenzollern, the Hapsburg and the Romanov families in Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia respectively, also fell during the war.\\n\\nWorld War I witnessed the first advent of Communism as a means of government in Russia. The following decades would see the transformation of the old Russian Empire into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, a global superpower. In the east, the demise of the Ottoman Empire paved the way for a modern democratic successor state, Turkey, in the core region of Anatolia, in addition to a number of successor states and territories throughout the Middle East. In Central Europe, the new states of Czechoslovakia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Yugoslavia were born and Austria, Hungary and Poland were re-created. Shortly after the war, in 1923, Fascists came to power in Italy; in 1933, 15 years after the war, Nazism took over Germany. Problems unresolved or created by the war would be highly important factors in the outbreak, within 20 years, of World War II.\\n\\n\\n\\nCauses:\\n\\nOn June 28, 1914, Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria and heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb student. The Archduke was there to assert imperial authority over a disputed province. Princip was supported by pan-Serbian nationalists, with links to the Serbian military. Though this assassination is usually considered the immediate trigger for the war, its origins can be traced back to the complex web of alliances and counterbalances that developed between the various European powers after 1871.\\n\\n\\nReasons and responsibilities\\nThe reasons for the outbreak of World War I are a complicated issue; there are many factors which intertwine. Some examples are:\\n\\nFervent and uncompromising nationalism \\nUnresolved previous disputes \\nThe intricate system of alliances \\nConvoluted and fragmented governance \\nDelays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications \\nThe arms races of the previous decades. \\nRigidity in military planning \n\nAnswer:",

A chaplin from a nursing home would come to visit with him, when my uncle got to sick to take care of he was placed in a nursing home. After his death the chaplin from the nursing home told me that during one of his home visits my uncle confessed to inappropriatly \"touching\" my 8 year old son when my son was 6. The chaplin said he did not tell me until after my uncles death beacause my uncle asked him not to until he passed away.Can I take any legal action against this chaplin since he knew about this and did not tell me until after his death even though the chaplin knew that I was taking care of my uncle in his home with my son there??\nAnswer: The chaplin is bound by privilege.  He cannot reveal any information that your uncle told him in confidence.  Even if he were a mandated reporter (I'm not so certain that he is) that mandate would only extend to those things he witnessed.  If the only information he had was from your uncle, then he is bound by privilege and could not legally disclose the information until after your uncle died (the privilege dies with the person.)\\n\\nI know that you must be very upset but the Chaplin is more than likely a dead end from a civil lawsuit standpoint.  However, did your uncle die with money?  If he has an estate, then you might be able to sue the estate.  The estate remains liable for any claims of injury against the decedent.  Talk to a lawyer as soon as possible.  If your Uncle's estate has already gone through probate, or is currently in probate, there is going to be a fairly short window of time within which to bring this claim.  Technically, the statute of limitations for claims owned by minors does not run until they reach the age of majority.  However, in this case, you have a quickly diminishing pile of money.  You need to jump on this as soon as possible.\\n\\nGo to www.martindale.com for a listing of lawyers in your area.  Talk to a personal injury lawyer.  That's probably your best bet.  Make sure it's one that is familiar with the claims reporting procedures against a decedent.\\n\\nFeel free to contact me through this service for any advice.  Understand, though, that I'm a California lawyer.  The laws in your state may be different but probably not dramatically so.\n\nAnswer:",

Up to a PO2 of 60 mm Hg, Hemoglobin is still substantially saturated with O2 and adequate amounts of O2 can be delivered to tissues and the brain. Also, when PO2 drops from 100 - 60, usually there is also increased PCO2 levels. So, ventilation is usually increased due to response of central and peripheral chemoreceptors to increasing PCO2 levels.\n\nAnswer:",

Both feel i dont have any problem but the problem still persists for over 4 years. can anybody help.I have also tried meditation irregularly.\nAnswer: There are many people who face different kinds of neurosis. There are also many people who have phobias. If you have had this problem for over 4 years, some books you may want read. Books that can teach people how to deal with such things. You may want to see a therapist or hypnosis. I don't know if there is a medication that will make this go away. One way to work on it, is by using exposure therapy. Start practicing doing this, when it isn't necessary, and if you have someone you feel you can trust to tell this too, have them with you as encouragement when you have to sign the documents, and continue on, taking steps to reach the goal of overcoming the neurosis. It sounds like it might be a phobia, and there are so many resources out there to help you learn how to overcome this. I wish you all the best\n\nAnswer:",

Air mass,front  2.Dew point, saturated?\nQuestion: Sorry ran out of room.\\n3. Relative humiditym dew point\\n4. Hurricane, tornado\nAnswer: An Air Mass is a large volume of Air having fairly uniform characteristics of temp., atmospheric pressure, and water vapor content.\\n\\nA Front is a boundary or transition zone between two air masses of different density, and thus (usually) of different temperature. A moving front is named according to the advancing air mass, e.g., cold front if colder air is advancing.\\n\\nDewpoint is a measure of atmospheric moisture. It is the temperature to which air must be cooled in order to reach saturation. A higher dew point indicates more moisture present in the air. It is sometimes referred to as Dew Point Temperature.\\nSaturated or Saturation is the cooling of the temp.\\n\\nRelative humidity is  the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor in a gaseous mixture of air and water to the saturated vapor pressure of water at a given temperature.\\n\\nDewpoint is a measure of atmospheric moisture. It is the temperature to which air must be cooled in order to reach saturation. A higher dew point indicates more moisture present in the air. It is sometimes referred to as Dew Point Temperature.\\n\\nA Hurricane is a storm system fueled by the heat released when moist air rises and the water vapor in it condense. It has sustained winds of at least 33 m/s (64 kt, 74 mph, or 118 km/h). A hurricane of this intensity tends to develop an eye, an area of relative calm at the center of circulation. Surrounding the eye is the eye wall, an area about 10-50 mi wide in which the strongest thunderstorms and winds circulate around the storm’s center.\\n\\nTornado is a violently rotating column of air in contact with the ground and extending from the base of a thunderstorm. \\n\\nThese are self explanatory.\n\nAnswer:",

What you do is take cards with different color combinations on them and show them to students ranging from kinder-garden to the 12th asking them which color combination is their favorite. The first case is where you do it individually and then as a collective class. You should find that the younger children will stand by their first choices even during a group decision. As the children get older they are more prone to follow the choices of their peers until the later years where individuality take hold once again and they start to diversify. I used pie charts and percentages to display alot of the information and also split up the classes into males and females for a follow up experiment. Its been many many years since I did it but I'm sure the results will fascinate the judges. Good Luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Instead of a handshake they would touch noses with the person they are greeting then slowly but firmly place there hand in the other persons genitals, they would expect you to do the same. When both yours and the Maoris hand are places on each others genitals you would move in closer to each other and your mouths will touch, you kiss and soon the Maoris tongue would enter your mouth, like a french kiss, but much more aggressive. This greeting would carry on about 5 mins until the Maori reaches an orgasm. Hope this helps :)\n\nAnswer:",

Once that's done you'll get your car back.  You don't need anything other then the title to have a tow company tow the car.  Once they have proof of the title showing you as sole owner (if your ex is on the title you have NO right to take the car or report it as stolen) they can tow it and ship it for you.  If you don't want a lien to be placed by the tow company you MUST PAY UPFRONT ALL COSTS, otherwise they have the legal right to a lien until paid regardless of if you didn't sign allowing a lien.

They are usually called 'Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery', however at Southampton it's just called 'Bachelor of Medicine'. They are abbreviated to MB BS, MB ChB, MB, BM BS, MB BChir etc. All of these are the same, so don't get hung up on qualifications! Following graduating with our MB ChB (or whatever) we are called doctors. This is an honorary title, as we do not have a postgraduate doctoral degree such as a PhD. However, in some specialities it is necessary to have a postdoctoral degree. Most medical degrees in the UK lead to provisional registration with the General Medical Council. However, there are some private medical schools which don't, so be aware. Some medical students also leave university with extra qualifications such as BSc (Hons), BA (Hons) or BMedSci (see below). \\n\\nhttp://www.wanttobeadoctor.co.uk/main.php?page=4\n\nAnswer:",

The circumstances of the terrorist attacks deserve the most serious and conscientious investigation. Both the Bush administration and the Democrats and Republicans in Congress have rejected any such probe, suggesting that to question the role of the FBI, CIA and other intelligence agencies is unpatriotic.\\n\\nBut the facts which are known so far point to the conclusion that officials at the highest levels of the US government knew that a major terrorist attack was under way and made no serious effort to prevent it. The political motive can be inferred: they permitted an attack to go forward—whether they knew its full dimensions or not—in order to provide the necessary pretext for carrying out a right-wing agenda of military intervention abroad and attacks on democratic rights at home.\n\nAnswer:",

The word hoplite (Greek ὁπλίτης, hoplitēs) derives from hoplon (ὅπλον, plural hopla, ὅπλα) meaning an item of armour or equiment and consequently the entire equipment of the hoplite (but not specifically the circular shield, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a hoplon, though it was in fact called an aspis). These soldiers probably first appeared in the late 8th century BC. These were a citizen-militia, and so were armed as spearmen, which are relatively easy to equip and maintain; mainly they represented the middle class, who could afford the cost of the armaments. Almost all the famous men of ancient Greece, even the philosophers and playwrights, fought as hoplites at some point in their lives.\\n\\nHow did they fight?\\nSince the hoplites were a militia force and did not receive permanent wages, campaigns were short and mainly confined to the summer. Armies marched directly to their target. There the defenders could hide behind city walls, in which case the attackers generally had to content themselves with ravaging the countryside as siegecraft was undeveloped, or meet them on the field. Battles were usually set piece and intended to be decisive. Both forces lined up on a level field, usually in a rough phalanx formation around eight ranks deep (though this varied). Other troops were less important; cavalry generally protected the flanks, when present at all, and both light infantry and missile troops were negligible.\\n\\nWith what did they fight?\\nHoplites generally armed themselves immediately before battle, since the equipment was so heavy. Each man provided his own gear so it was fairly non-uniform, and often friendly troops would fail to recognise one another. A hoplite typically had a breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well as greaves and other armor, plus a bowl-shaped wooden shield called an aspis which was around 1 metre across. The primary weapon was a spear, around 2.7 metres in length; as this frequently broke upon charging and was unwieldy for close combat, hoplites also carried a smaller 60 cm thrusting sword called a xiphos. The total cost of the hoplon was roughly equivalent to a middle-sized car in our time.\n\nAnswer:",

I don't know the question but just give me a good answer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nAnswer: If this is actually true you are ruining your health. Your body needs at least 7 hours of sound sleep to repair cells in the body and the brain.\\nIf you dont get SLEEP here is what will happen and it can start happening after a week of little sleep:\\n\\nYour hair will start falling out/thining\\nYour eyes will feel week and blurry\\nYour blood pressure will elevate\\nYour cholesterol will elevate (bad type)\\nYou will lose muscles and get weaker\\nYou will start gaining weight\\nYour body will not be able to break down sugars and fats\\nYour body will get less oxygen\\nYour will depleat your body of vitamins and minerals \\nAnd this is only the start.\\n\\nMy sons friend was only getting one or two hours of sleep a night and going to college and working late. He started having all kinds of problems even some of the ones above. He still has a bad backache even though he is sleeping well now (the last 6 mos).\\nSome of the damage can stick around a long time. The body must get sleep to repair cells and for rest and for your brain to rest too.\\n\\nIt is dangerous to not get sleep as you can fall asleep anywhere at anytime. The body just shuts down. You could be driving, walking, in school, or anywhere. \\nI know it happened to me when I was a teen.\n\nAnswer:",

I can work on improving it and measure every little thing I do.\\n\\nCTR is something I cannot estimate. It will depend on the website type, I imagine. (imisidro) Your website looks like an information site, so your CTR would be similar to the one I would expect. May I inquire what CTR it might average? Anyone else that has a CTR for a site that would help me?\\n\\nThe earnings per click are 70% of what google makes is this true? Also how can I estimate this number for a given topic. It is easy to tell what it will cost at google adwords to place 1-3 or 4-6 or 7-10 on a given keyword, are any of these good numbers to use as average?\\n\\nthanks for ALL thoughts on the matter\nAnswer: You are forgetting something in your formula = smart pricing. \\n\\nSmart pricing is the big unknown that can significantly reward or discount your clicks. In the email sent in 2004  by Google when it introduced smart pricing https://adwords.google.com/select/news/sa_mar04.html they explain smart pricing as \\n\\n\"if our data shows that a click is less likely to turn into business results (e.g. online sale, registration, phone call, newsletter sign-up), we may reduce the price you pay for that click ... We take into account many factors such as what keywords or concepts triggered the ad, as well as the type of site on which the ad was served. For example, a click on an ad for digital cameras on a web page about photography tips may be worth less than a click on the same ad appearing next to a review of digital cameras.\"\\n\\nSo it is not a straightforward estimate - an advertiser paying $0.10 cents for a click from content network (Adsense publishers) does not give you assurance that you get 70 cents (assuming a 70-30 split with Google and publisher). It could be more, or it could be less depending on how smart pricing looks at your site. Webmasters continue to dissect what it is, how it actually works, how often it is applied -- and WebmasterWorld alone has hundreds of threads on this topic.\\n\\nThe other factors are something you can control: ad impressions you can work to increase your traffic; CTR with your ad placement and layout. My site, an information site, is a perfect vehicle for Adsense and we get very good results (double digit CTR, and 5-digit monthly income). [Sorry can't reveal much lest I be in violation of Adsense TOS]\\n\\nBut not all websites fit well with the program, as we wrote in the article \"Contextual Advertising: Why Are You Earning Only Pennies?\" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/022006/adsense.htm -- but it is how you experiment and play around the variables that you can control that can result to your earnings. Markus Finch's PlentyofFish.com website earned millions because he has gargantuan traffic, even though his CPM and EPC are paltry. Fos us, we continue to experiment with the colors of the Adlinks, how to space the large rectangles, etc.\\n\\nOne excellent resource I suggest if you want more to understand Adsense is the Jensense blog http://www.jensense.com/ - this is written by the moderator of the Adsense forum at WebmasterWorld (Jenstar). You can learn a lot from reading her blog as she is very knowledgeable of the topic.\\n\\nPS. Thank you for the invite to answer your question :o)\n\nAnswer:",

Einstien come up with the equation E=mc2? how will it be ralative in dev. of a-bomb/fusion?\nAnswer: The E=mc^2 equations come from Einstein's theory of Special Relativity. Special Relativity concerns the laws of motion and observed properties when objects are travelling very close to the speed of light.\\n\\nSpecial relativity starts with two premises: the speed of light is constant for all observers, and the laws of physics are the same for all observers. However, observed properties are not necessarily the same.\\n\\nSay I flew past the Earth in a space ship travelling 99% the speed of light. To me, the space ship is normal, but the Earth would look squished, rotated, and blue with everyone moving slowly. To you, however, Earth would look normal, but the space ship would be squished, rotated, blue and with everyone moving very slowly. (This gets resolved if the space ship turns around - breaking the symmetry - to come home, and results in the famous Twins \"Paradox.\")\\n\\nIn describing the laws of motion in the context of special relativity Einstein derived that E = mc^2 -- in other words that mass has a \"rest energy.\"\\n\\nIf an electron and an anti-matter electron (known as the positron) bump into each other then their is total energy conversion. The mass of two electrons is converted into energy.\\n\\nIn a fission or fusion bomb the the atomic process (breaking apart a heavy atom, or fusing some light atoms) results in a  much smaller conversion of mass to energy. But still a lot compared with normal explosives.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, many people these days read the Bible, NKJV (New King James Version) but are unaware that King James changed the text and used it as his own book of laws over his own people. . .Why follow this book, knowing that the original Bible has obviously been altered by additions, omissions and changes?\nAnswer: It is my understanding that:\\n\\nActually, NONE of the gospels are the direct words of Jesus.  They were all written a couple generations after (Luke and Mark weren't even apostles!).\\n\\nThe Gnostic Gospels were not included into the bible because they preach a more self-sufficient version of Christianity, where the person, not the church, is responsible for their relationship with God.  They refer to Christianity in a similar sense as modern buddhism.\\n\\nIt is MY belief (and I emphasize belief, as no one knows for sure) that the gnostic gospels were excluded from the bible because:\\n\\n- They de-emphasize the church...therefore leaving less influenece, power, and control over the religion for the church\\n\\n- They emphasize a more \"inner religion\", where its not about what the religion as a whole wants or believes, but rather the individual person.  This can be deeply fulfilling for an individual, or very unnerving as there would be little unison and coordination in the religion.\\n\\n- They did not properly imply the possibility that Jesus was God.\n\nAnswer:",

Your parents, the father and his parents are responsible.  No exceptions.  If the father refuses to pay, he should be neutered.  No exceptions.\\n\\nIf you are of age and get pregnant and want to go on welfare it will be mandatory that you are spaded.  If the father refuses or can't pay, he should be neutered.  You have acted like an animal and should be treated like one.  People who can't take responsibility for their own actions shouldn't be allowed to procreate.  No exceptions.\\n\\nImmigrants should not get any welfare, social services or tax exemptions at all.  If you want to be a part of a different country then you should contribute to it.  All these church groups that help immigrants come into a country should be forced to support them.  You brought them here, you take financial responsibility for them or they will be shipped back at your expense.  No exceptions.\\n\\nAny elderly or handicapped must show exactly where their assets went before receiving aid of any kind.

Together with the recently identified IMMUTANS protein, a homologue of the alternative oxidase of mitochondria, one role of the Ndh complex may be to participate in a chlororespiratory electron transfer pathway . Additionally Ndh may play a role in cyclic electron flow around photosystem one.\\n\\n2-Evidence is presented to substantiate a chloroplastic respiratory pathway in the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, whereby reducing equivalents generated during the degradation of starch enter the thylakoidal chain at the plastoquinone site catalyzed by NADH-plastoquinone reductase. In this formulation, the reduced plastoquinone is oxidized either by the photoevolution (photosystem I) of H2 under anaerobic conditions or by O2 during dark respiration.\n\nAnswer:",

We have domesticated animals through the years for companionship, entertainment and pleasure. Now, animals normally kept in a zoo are never socialized to the point of being a pet and I do believe they should be left to their natural habitat. I have never been to a circus because I believe so strongly that the animals are made to perform things that they aren't supposed to do and would never do in nature. I won't support them. The danger for animals that depend on us are great when left to fend for themselves. They have been domesticated and therefore are dependent on us as their providers. I can see that in the near future though, with land and timber being developed for human convenience we are going to see a lot more \"born-free\" animals close to our houses. They are running out of natural habitat and have to relocate. But, I'm just as sure that humans will kill them without considering that we have destroyed where their home was and they have to go somewhere.\n\nAnswer:",

Both detect nothing wrong with my PC. Why does Windows File Protection keep asking for my Windows XP setup CD?\nAnswer: I run all the same programs. First log onto Windows up date and make sure you have ALL of the available updates for XP(especially the security ones,you may be surprised if there are a lot).You may have to disable Adware to do this. Then make sure you are running Nortons fire wall and not the Windows default firewall(this is usually done automatically upon Norton set-up). Make sure you run live update on Norton Program every day that you log on to the internet. Do not trust Any Auto up-date programs! Run A full virus scan manually now and no less than once per week. Then see about reloading your set-up program. If this does not work, Try resetting your computer to the very first day you installed XP and repeat the above procedures. Somewhere, something in your setup program has been removed. If you continue to have this problem, E-mail Microsoft's Help Desk. GOOD LUCK!\n\nAnswer:",

First of all, he still has a good number of Republicans in his corner. Also, some of the gains made by the Democrats were from Conservative Democrats like Lieberman, Casey. Webb, and Tester. When it comes to certain issues, like the war on terror, don't count Bush out as the Republicans along with the conservative Democrats still may be able to prevent the Liberals from waving the white flag and retreat from Iraq, leaving victory to the terrorists.\n\nAnswer:",

He wants to keep it, I want to cash out. Capital gains?\nQuestion: How can I sell my half to my brother without getting screwed, regarding capitol gains taxes? It's not my primary residence.\\nIt's a $300,000 dollar property with $60,000 left on the mortgage. What would you do?\nAnswer: The mortgage is not relevant for taxes.  You need to know your tax basis in the property.  Normally, property received by inheritance is valued at the time of death to determine basis.  This means you should not have a capital gain.  You said the house is \"in trust\".  If this is true, neither you or your brother own the house, the trust does.  Your ability to \"cash out\" is determined by the terms of the trust and the decision of the trustee.  You need to consult and attorney who needs to read the trust documents.\n\nAnswer:",

And he's not just a liberal, hes a LIBERAL, big time.  I've researched him.  He's very leftists, so I do think he'll try to appease the islamic countries, and if he must use his religion to gain those means, I don't see that stopping him.  However, he's just one Representative.  In most likelyhood he wont affect foreign affairs whatsoever, and instead just get alot of pork (no pun intended, I swear) for his district like every other Representative tries to do\n\nAnswer:",

I want to include a reference from my supervisors at my work to my resume/application.  Would I just have them as a reference, or could I have them write a letter of recomendation?  Should I go with two or stick with only one?  how long should the recomendation be?  Personal experience only please.\nAnswer: Ask for a written letter of recommendation.  People move on, you might not be able to track him down in the future.  Present him with a written reminder list of things you have done while on that one year assignment.  \\n\\nI have 3 letters of recommendation which have helped me tremendously. 2 of the 3 bosses are no longer with the company I worked for.  I include them when I apply for some jobs because I have moved to another state.  So instead of asking future employers to make a long distance phone call, they have that letter right there.  They probably still want to call if I am a serious candidiate for the job, but in the meantime they have proof of satisfying some other former employers.  \\n\\nWhen you work for a temp agency, so many times you are just \"that temp guy\".  If you have established a rapport with someone at an assignment, I think it's vital for you to get a letter.  The HR department at that company can't verify what you did, they can only see that for XX amount of time, they had someone outsourced from XX company.  You didn't technically work for that firm, you are employed techincally by the temp agency.  That is why it's even more important for somone in your situation to ask for letters if people are willing to write them.\\n\\nGood luck on your next gig!\n\nAnswer:",

And Who Invented It?\nQuestion: Id really like to know because I am a big time baseball fan.\nAnswer: The origins and evolution of the various bat-and-ball games are murky, and many believe that baseball is primarily an American invention. However, many believe that it originated as an adaptation of the game of rounders, and was also influenced by the rules of cricket. As far back as the 1870s, American newspapers were referring to baseball as \"The National Pastime\" or \"The National Game.\" An award-winning account of the origins of the game is David Block's Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (University of Nebraska Press, 2005). The publisher's description of the book notes that \"David Block looks into the early history of the game and of the 150-year-old debate about its beginnings. He tackles one stubborn misconception after another, debunking the enduring belief that baseball descended from the English game of rounders and revealing a surprising new explanation for the most notorious myth of all—the Abner Doubleday–Cooperstown story.\" In short, the debate on the game's origins may never be settled to everyone's satisfaction.\n\nAnswer:",

The adjective 'public' denotes 'government', though it often encompasses nonprofit organizations, as well. It is different from private administration. A good working definition is, \"taking care of the state's, and international organizations', business by civil servants within the executive branch of government, other than public policy.\"\\n-from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration\\n\\nThe Public Administration sector consists of establishments of federal, state, and local government agencies that administer, oversee, and manage public programs and have executive, legislative, or judicial authority over other institutions within a given area. These agencies also set policy, create laws, adjudicate civil and criminal legal cases, provide for public safety and for national defense. ...\\n-from http://eadiv.state.wy.us/i&e/i&egloss.htm\n\nAnswer:",

I want to start with my abs and legs.  My question is what are good exercises to get killer abs and what is good to trim down the saddlebags??  Thanks for your help and please no idiot answers..\nAnswer: mix it up with situps and crunches.  When you go up hold yourself in the half way up position then go all the way up then hold in the halfway down position then all the way down.  Give yourself time to feel the burn when holding in the halfway positions.\\nDo about 20 to 30 minutes of this everyday.  Also do not rest in the down position.  This will give you nice abs quickly.\\nFor faster results do this in the morning as soon as you wakeup then again before going to sleep.\\nBe sure to stretch your abs EVERY time you do this. before and after.\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Most states are now centralized and usually Child support will have a 1-800 number to call. Make sure that you have your social security number or case number handy when you make your call. Most child enforcement agencies will need that information before they can even talk to you. Good luck to you.\n\nAnswer:",

Once we had to tackle him because he was beating the crap out of the fridge in his sleep. He was black and blue for a week. He used to run outside and even learned how to work locks in his sleep so we had to put a flip over style latch low too the floor. He couldn't ever figure it out. I would wake up with to hear lightly, \"clank, clank, clank\" it was my baby bro slowly pulling open the door only to be stopped by the latch. He would have this really confused look on his face and I would put him back in bed. LOL He used to call me Mom in his sleep and would ask if I could make whatever (usually incomprehisible at that point) better. I would say that I took care of it and he would go back to bed. He doesn't do it a whole lot anymore now that he has a new dog. For some reason having that mutt in his bed keeps him quite. Either that or he just grew out of it. I used to do it too (although I was never as bad as my brother) and now I rarely even talk in my sleep anymore. Hmmmmmmm...\n\nAnswer:",

Affix them to card-stock and tape them to the kitchen cabinets and around the noshing table.\\n\\nActivity: Ask guests to bring ingredients for one delicious group dish.

If management also lets you fill the place with balloons, then go all out. \\n\\nActivity: Manicures and pedicures!

Include intructions for each guest to bring a different \"sexy\" salad. Each guest should come prepared with an explanation for why her salad is sexy. \\n\\nDecorations: Clear out a room and cover the floor with blankets. Grab that old picnic basket from the attic and rummage at yardsales for a vintage cooler for pink lemonade. (Mason jars are just the right touch for drinks). Arrange stems of tulips in pieces of green floral foam around the room for a glorious indoor Saturday afternoon at the park indoors.\\n\\nActivity: Cut out horseshoes from brown posterboard and use bar stool legs for stakes. \\n\\nEats: Traditional picnic fare: cold sandwiches (pesto chicken, mozzarella and tomato, turkey and swiss), chips, and the assorted fruit and pasta salads. Chocolate chip cookies and brownies are also a must.\\n\\nGifts: What else for the fun-loving couple but backyard games? We suggest a croquet or badminton set, or bocce balls.

You can't own dogs or pickup trucks and putting a Christmas reef on your front door is prohibited.  You get bored out of your mind because every day is the same and there is no variety. The advantage to this is that everything works smoothly and orderly and people that aren't really bright and have no ambition can handle living there.\\n\\nPC is like living in a mansion on a large estate where anything you say goes.  You are free to do stupid as well as smart things.  You can let your grass grow tall and turn your stereo up all the way.  People (programmers) from all over the world give you stuff for free.\\n\\nIn other words, the Mac is for simple minded people that can't figure out how to operate a PC.\n\nAnswer:",

It drives me crazy when my boss \"forgets\" that she already told me to do something.\nAnswer: That they always want to blame the staff for their decisions.  They expect us to remember stuff from three years ago without having to look it up, they will change how tings are done on a moment's notice, and will tell three differnt employees three different things on how they want something done.  They cut us off before we can tell them something then ask why they were never told.  They say there is \"no money\" for raises, then buy $50,000 vehicles for their salespeople, then blame the office staff that their profits are down.  They also sell products at lower than they pay for them and blame the staff for them showing a loss on it.\n\nAnswer:",

I was watching a documentary on Japan, and I was almost in tears, I was stunned how \"real\" people are there, there beautiful traditions, and hard-working happy people, Education is VERY important. It seems in America everyone takes everything for granted.\nAnswer: People are too materialistic here...they think that money is pleasure which is not always the case. People will go to all extents for money and the worst is when they sue each other or companies for the dumbest reasons. The latest I heard is someone sueing Apple 'coz iPod can cause deafness, which I personally feel is a really stupid excuse. So instead of enjoying all things in life people spend day and night running behind money. Respect for other people is almost absent compared to other civilizations like Asian, Indian, etc and you can see that the people there have less stressful lives (although they might not be faring as well monetarily). They have a culture which Americans don't. People dont fake their love for other people like many people do in the US. I am not saying that all people in the US are bad and all people in the above countries are good. But these are cultural tendencies...\n\nAnswer:",

Epinephrine makes the heart muscle more irritable, so that it is more likely to be receptive to defibrillation (electric shock).\\n\\nEpinephrine is also used to increase heart rate and blood pressure, and for emergency treatment of anaphylactic shock and severe asthma.\\n\\n(And we never give intra-cardiac injections, like in \"Pulp Fiction\".

Then you find out from one of your friends that he has been asking about you every week, and that he has put on weight and isnt himself. Then out of the blue he calls you and needs to talk. Now yall are seeing eachother again(you talk about 3 times a week and see eachother about 2 times week, yall do everything you did before and you are soo happy when your with eachother) then you find out he still has all of your love letter/lil notes and the first flower you ever gave him,plus his momma still has your pic. on her wall. He tells you that he doesnt want anyother girl but he cant be in a relationship right now(i know that he cant be in one,thats true,if u knew what all he has to do.U know he cares about you cause he always makes sure your ok, and when my car broke down in our winter storm he came and fixed it. What does is mean,does he still love me? Will we be 2gether again\nAnswer: He may still love you, yes.  But what exactly is keeping him from being in a relationship with you?  \\n\\nI would not count on this individual to commit to you.  This guy sounds like he may be confused or unsure.  And he may take a long time making up his mind.  If his indecision is causing you heartache, then you need to do what is going to preserve your sanity.  You need to do what is good for you.  This may mean moving on.  This may mean not waiting around for him.\\n\\nI'm sorry if this sounds harsh.  It sounds like you still have feelings for him.  I don't know your exact circumstances.  However, I do know what it is like to be jerked around by a guy who couldn't decide if I was \"the one.\"  It's not fun, and it's not worth your time.  \\n\\nIf you are really set on this guy, you may have to wait for a long time for him to come to his senses.  Ask yourself, honestly, is he worth it?\\n\\nGood luck.\n\nAnswer:",

Serious answers only please. Thanks in advance.\nAnswer: You need to be relaxed before you'll get wet, so take things much more slowly. Start with some making out, move on to focusing on your neck and your breasts, get him to play with your nipples, suck them or lick them, whatever you like best, let him move gradually down your stomach, stroke your inner thighs and vaginal area. Get him to focus on your clitoris, touching, rubbing, licking, sucking, whatever......and by then you should be pretty wet - it's making me wet just thinking about it!!!\\n\\nIf it continues to be a problem, buy some lubricant, KY jelly, or something like that.\n\nAnswer:",

But Most of the time, it does.  The pain of hemmoroids can be eased with icing the area.  (Wrapping an ice cube in a paper towel and securing it in place with a female sanitary napkin.)

It's late right now, so major things to work on.\\n\\n1. Learn about morality therapy as much as you can.  it is not really mainstream, but these kids really need to rebuild a moral center.  Book (what do u stand for?)  great morality builder.\\n\\n2.  you will prolly have more success with the adults.  Adolescents are aweful, but in working with them, you need to come through the back door.  Like, I will find out what a certain kid likes, ex. Eminem, and have it playing as they come in for their first session.  Most of em are like, \"Wow you like that music.\"  and that's the back door.  Also, teenagers don't wanna know that they are being counseled, so you need to be \"under the hood\" when talking with them.  Some sort of activity that they are interested in.\\n\\n3.  Study contempory adlerian therapy for children.  \\n\\n4.  In my experience, 99% of the time it is the child's aweful past with someone or their parents who are really messed up.  I never met a problem kid with Beaver Cleaver parents.\\n\\n5. stay patient..kids like these can drive you bonkers at times...to keep yourself sane...keep saying that this kid is sick or his family is sick...stay with em'...they need me...you find in time that these same kids will tell you as they have told me with tears in their eyes, \"You're not gonna leave me too are u.  You're a lot of fun.\"  It is at this moment that you will know y you became a counselor.\\n\\n\\nGood Luck and take care.\n\nAnswer:",

How can I show her I care about her feelings?\nQuestion: She says all I care about are my feelings. I do all sorts of sweet stuff for her, like take her out to movies, dinner, trips, etc.. I treat her like gold. So how can I show her I care about her feelings?\nAnswer: You mentioned many good things to not only impress a woman but to keep her satisfied materialistically. However, in my experience, when a woman says that you don't care about her feelings that usually means she feels that you don't listen to or try to help her with her problems or you don't ask for or respect her opinions. Both of these will require you to work on your listening skills. In the case of her problems she may only require someone to listen to her, if you have any advice, guidance or help to give then by all means give it. If not, then let her know that you will be there for her if she needs something from you. In the case of her opinions not only will you have to ask for them but also do what she wants to do, even when you don't want to.\\nGifts, trips, dates, these are all things that all women want, but they are far from ways that show that you care. Listening, offering your service, and respecting her opinion are but some of the ways to show a woman that you care about her feelings.\n\nAnswer:",

I have tried eye drops but all they do is sting, and my nose is runny too and i have medication something like rhinobusin. I have contacts so when this happens i have to take them out but my eye doesnt get any better. What can i do?\nAnswer: sadly, you need the drops - the sting is not constant it will go away. \\n\\n\\nOptions: See allergist and have skin test and then get immunotherapy shots; however, until the immune system is reversed you might not get results (remember the shots are just a mix of everything that makes you allergic)  so you need to take meds along with the weekly shots.\\n\\nStay in A/C area as much as possible.  If really bad the doctors will recommend wearing a mask outside (I haven't done that, thought)\\n\\nAfter being outside, the moment you get inside, change your clothes and take a shower = you need to get all the stuff that makes you allergic away from you.\\n\\nEnsure house is clean and no mildew.  Wash linens in hot, hot water. Cover pillow and mattress with anti-allergic covers.\\n\\nMy doctor told me that the  machines that are advertised on TV to clean the air, really don't work  that well - so for me not to waste my money on one.\\n\\nAs allergic as you are, you will not feel relief until the first HARD frost. Even Fall is a bad time for allergens.\\n\\nIf you like to do outdoor stuff, suggest that you check the weather report (on the computer is best - weather.com or whateverf you use) and see what the allergens are for that day - and time of day - try to avoid being out at the peak times, if possible.\\n\\nIf you can handle at home, there are 1st generation (i.e. meds that have been on sale and approved by FDA for a while that used to be prescription and are now over-the-counter) that will help - try them out. Give each a month at least == Claritin, Benadryl and others (ask pharmacist)\\n\\nUse anti-allergic makeup (like Almay) Especiaally around eyes.\\n\\nSome people claim that Honey of the bees in your area helps them. I haven't tried this but I asked the doctor and pharmacist and they said it didn't but if I wanted to try it, to go for it as honey is good on/in anything.\\n\\nDo not, when tempted to do so, open your windows at home - all the allergens come in and stay in.  Sadly, this is just a fact.  If you have to, then realize that you will suffer.\\n\\nThe doctor can do several things to help you = this is how they are handling mine:\\n\\n\\nFor eyes: doctor can prescribe two different ones - to use morning and before going to bed (ones that I've used that work are: optivar and elestat (one drop of each med in the a.m. and at night)\\n\\nFor nose: Flonase and Astelin (two puffs of each in A.M. and p.m)\\n\\nSingulair or Clarinex or both - depends how bad it is for you \\n\\nAllerx-dose pack: one in a.m. and one in p.m.\\n\\nFor sinus headache: just advil (ibruprofen) or tylenol. But if it gets so bad that the sinus is infected (i.e. sinusitis or ethmoid disease) then you will need prednisone to releave the inflammation.\\n\\nOh by the way, if your eyes get puffy/red and you want some relief this helps me: ice pack over eyes for about 30 mins.  OR take some camomille tea bagas (that have been wet beforehand) put in the freezer on a plate and then put on eyes untl the bags are warm --- I put a bunch of them in the freezer. When frozen then I zip lock them and they are ready when I need them.  Also, you need several to ensure you can put on both eyes for at least 30 mins.  \\n\\n.\n\nAnswer:",

This mechanism is indirect; insulin binds to its receptor and promotes glucose transporter expression on the cell surface.

K well the first night I dreamt that I was going back out with my ex boy friend..and that I was not thinking at all about my boy friend that I have now.. we seemed so happy..\\nLast nights dream was that I was with my ex boy friend and we were kissing in the forrest (dont ask.. its so random.. i know..) and then he just said take it slow.. :S.. whats that supposed to mean.. and I know that im not dreaming of my ex coz i still like him, coz i really dont.. I just find it weird that im liking him in my dreams.. evrey thing is going ok with my Bf  i have now.. so i dont ''miss'' my old one..\\nAnyways if you can help me by answering it would be great!! :)\nAnswer: I wish that you had been more descriptive with the actual dream.  Colors, surroundings, animals all play an important part.  But I will still do my best.  Your ex signifies \"voices from the past\".  It could have been anyone from the past, but your mind chose him probably so that you would pay attention to the dream itself.  The \"voices from the past\" are telling you that you are trying to grow too fast.  That you need to take the time and learn from what lifes lessons are trying to teach you now, not what lifes lessons will teach you in the furture.  Be(act,live) your age.  It is quite possible that you are trying to mature too quickly and that you are getting ahead of yourself.  SLOW you life down, there is more than enough time for the \"adult\" stuff when you are an adult.  Thus the kissing(intimacy).  Having adult(intimate)relations at a young age can and will do more damage than good.  Be young while you can, there are some basic lessons that need to learned before you progress to the more advandes lessons.  The forest signifies different levels of growth, from saplings to \"old\" trees.  The trees remind us that we should accept the rate at which we grow.  Today is today, and tomorrow is tomorrow.  Learn todays lesson today...tomorrows lessons when?...that's right tomorrow.  Trees also remind us to stay rooted to what is most important.  To a tree it is the earth, have you ever seen an uprooted tree grow, or live.  Our roots are our families.  Our families are our BEST resources, we need them like the trees need the earth.  You will grow up. You will eventually have all of the priveldges and responsibilites of adulthood.  There is no need to rush into it now.\n\nAnswer:",

Here each person will be moving randomly.And in the second ground same number of military men assembled for parade and standing and moving in a specified pattern.\\nIf two men run through the two fields to the other side of the field, only the man running through the military men can easily reach the other end.This is because they are arranged in a certain pattern.\\nIn the same way, ice cubes are traslucent because ice cubes are crystals and in crystals molicules are arranged in a definite pattern, hence it allows the light to enter and a few of light to pass through it.When this cube crushed, most of the light is reflected back, hence it appears white.\n\nAnswer:",

Help Me?\nQuestion: Hi I have been working at a company I really like since the middle of may. The company sells alumni directors to schools all over the usa by telephone. People call us and we call people. Today I had some very frustrating calls. One of which the customer would not stop talking and I in return was very patient. The very next call I got frustrated with a customer and after I thought they had hung up I said sort of under my breathe \"*****\" well it turns out that the company recorded the call and heard me say that. Well I have a 90 day window where I am suppose to not screw up. Well when the manager listens to a message and hears me say ***** thats not good. He said he didnt know if the customer had hung up yet or not, but im about 99.9 % sure I would never say that to someones face. So tonight I had to go talk to him and he said I was suspended and they were gonna deliberate to see if the customer had hung up. I either will get fired or on a final notice. What should I do? I feel fucked\nAnswer: It sounds like you had a weak moment, but it was nothing intentional...If the customer heard you say *****, they would have likely called to complain about it immediately, and requested to speak to your superior.  It's more likely that they simply didn't hear you...I have to speak to clients on a daily basis; in person and over the phone.  You screwed up, but it's not the end all be all...This information might go into your personnel file (is the fact that someone \"may\" have heard you that much of a black mark, really?).  If by chance you are fired, all you can do is chalk it up to a lesson learned...Keep in mind also, if the client was verbally abusive, you should not have to tolerate it...Tell them so, and hang up.  Good luck :)\n\nAnswer:",

This time Ivory Coast will be the team to watch (Ghana and Angola are not bad teams either). My feeling is that Ivory Coast will shock the world and will advance to the second round along with Argentina, leaving the Netherlands and Serbia behind.\\n\\nThey recently lost a close match against Spain, 3-2, displaying great offensive skills but failing defensively at the latter part of the game.\\n\\nDo you agree?\\n\\nIf not, who do you predict will be team that will provide the biggest surprise?\\n\\n###\nAnswer: i agree with you 100%, i think africa always has onesuprising team at least, this year it will be Ivory Coast, they have great players like Drogba and Toure. They have one of there best squads ever in there history. I also think they will advance with argentina out of the group stages, leaving holland behind, i agree with you comlpetely. argentina has more of a balanced team, so it will be tough for Ivory Coast to find a weak spot to attack, and they have Riquelme in the midfield who can dictate games and be a field general. Holland have some great player like Ruud Van Nistelrooy, but aren't as balanceed as Argentina, so i think ivory coast will be able to break them down much easier and win. You're a smart man/women for thinking this too.\n\nAnswer:",

For most men and young man that I have seen as patients many told me that most of the times when they were teenagers they have sex more than once a day. Many masturbates over four times a day. Is it normal? Yes, it is normal; the older you get the more energy you use to have sex and to keep it going for a while. Therefor once you reach over 40 you will start to get tired more often and intercourse will be much shorter than an hour.\\n\\nOn women, it depends of how active she is or not. If the women is active and she has the physical abilities to keep it going over an hour it is very normal. However, you have to becareful if you are a woman, when intercourse lasts over than an hour your private areas will get tender and at times loses sensation. When this happens, a couple hours after intercourse you will find that your private areas starting to get sore, I recommend to space out the frequency of long intercourse. You just have to watch your self and always practice safe sex.\n\nAnswer:",

Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?\\n\\nThis is what I can think of:\\n\\nRetributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social \"harmony\" or \"balance.\"  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.\\n\\nThe rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you like Jack or Mich bette? Do you support the Jack and Sam relationship?\nAnswer: I love the series it's one of my favorites (besides Farscape and Andromeda), I think that between the great plots and the fantastic character development, it really has a lot going for it. I mean how many other shows last ten years- not many (not to mention it also inspired Atlantis which has become quite successful). \\n\\nWhen it comes to O'Neill and Mitchell, it's really hard to decide who I like better; and I think it's unfair to judge Mitchell this early on considering RDA had eight years of playing O'Neill but Ben Browder has only been there for one. However, both of their performances have been wonderful, you'd be hard pressed to find a better leader of SG-1 than one of them. They both bring (or in O'Neill's case, have brought) a great dynamic to the show, and it really wouldn't be the same without them.\\n\\nAs for the whole Jack/Sam relationship, I really have nothing against it, but I'm not in favor of it either. In my opinion, a little bit of romance on the show is okay, but if they had ever gotten together, I think it really might have made things very different.\n\nAnswer:",

Instead of CVs and resumes, wouldn't it be better if we hired people based on their skills, but also on their personalities, like their qualities as a person?  Most people, if it's their field have something to offer in the workplace.  I never want to feel I'm \"beating out\" or better than someone else.\nAnswer: I think American society is way too competitive, but I guess I'd rather have people earn things through education and experiance rather than all the people who get by on someone else's achievements, like a kid riding on his/her parents hard work, But it gets kind of scary when I heard about parents trying to get their baby into the most 'prestigious' pre-school?! thats scary man\n\nAnswer:",

In Iraq the Sunni neighborhoods are making the Shites leave under threat of death and visa versa.

Most rectal bleeding comes from the colon, rectum, or anus. The color of the blood often depends on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The closer the bleeding site is to the anus, the blood will be a brighter red. Bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon tend to be dark red or maroon colored. It would be best to see your doctor to determine what the exact cause may be.\n\nAnswer:",

If a man gets into bed with another man, while that other man is WITH a woman, the two men shall be put to death for this abomination? Is it possible this pasage refers to two men taking advantage of a woman?? That group sex is wrong, not GAY sex? And it says nothing about two women lying together anywhere in the Bible does it? And isn't two women lying together the same supposed \"sin\" as two men lying togeher? I think the church is wrong! This passage has been misunderstood! What do you all think? Serious, honest answers only.\nAnswer: You make some very good points.

If some of you younger fans can imagine Shaq hitting 28 of 32 FT's in a game, that's about what this was like.\\n\\nHe also pulled down 25 rebounds that night, and played all 48 minutes, as was his usual custom.\\n\\nAnd 169-147 was the final score.\\n\\nThere is NO video of this game. One newspaper sent a photographer only because the editor was listening to the game on the radio, and he sent the photographer over in case Wilt made history, which he did. There were originally no photographers assigned to this game.\\n\\nAttendance was just over 4,000.\n\nAnswer:",

Of course the only difference is that Brady has gotten the job done in the really big games and Manning has not.  I still have to give the edge to the Patriots.

The U.S. has had very little to trust about the government that Iran has had since 1979.  Iran has expressed the desire to drive Israel out of the Middle East, Iran has sponsored events that call the Holocust of the 1930's and 40's as being a myth, and indeed something that did not happen.  This Myth is supposedly been used to create the state of Israel in 1948.  Part of Irans political agenda is for the destruction of Israel.  The President of Iran states that Israel should be moved to either Germany or the U.S.  I do not understand why they should be Germany's problem if there was no Holocust, and the thought is to return them to the U.S. where they came from, however the Jewish people have been around for over 6,000 years and America has only been populated by the \"Old World\" for the past 500 years.  The land of Israel and/or Palistine is mentioned in the Bible written long before the Muslim Religion was founded some 700 or so years later.  Why is it so hard for Iran to understand that with their background based in hatered of other people's of the world that the U.N. would want to monitor the peaceful use of Nuclear Power that Iran wants to develope.  How can they not see that the world will not trust that their intentions are not merely peaceful after their history which is an open book.  It is important to the free world to monitor the use of Nuclear Materials and maintain a strict inventory of them.  I hope that this answer has covered all the double talk that your question has posed.\n\nAnswer:",

It's so annoying! When I get my period, I use tampons and tampons only. But, it always leaks and I always have these stupid stains. I'm going on vacation to Washington DC, and I think I'll get it there. Aside from the point that it'll ruin my vacation, I'm also mad because I'm sharing a suite with my mom, my  mom's friend, and my aunt & cousin. What do I do?\nAnswer: To avoid stains you should put on panty liners in your panties while you wear tampons then once it gets full you can change them like you would a regular pad. You should never wear tampons when you are sleeping. You could forget you have it on in the morning or you could have more of a leakage while you're sleep with it on. Always wear pads while you are sleeping. It shouldn't be that bad when you go on your vacation just as long as you take control of your period and make sure that you are doing the right stuff and using the right stuff.

The Twilight Zone. Hoodoo Sea. The Devil's Triangle. The vast three-sided segment of the Atlantic Ocean bordered by Bermuda, Puerto Rico and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, did not receive its most famous nickname until 1964, but reports of bizarre happenings there, or nearby, have been recorded for centuries. In fact, many claim that Christopher Columbus bore witness to the Bermuda Triangle's weirdness.\\n\\nAs the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria sailed through the area in 1492, it is reported that Columbus's compass went haywire and that he and his crew saw weird lights in the sky, but these events have mundane explanations. From the account in Columbus's journal, it is thought that his compass's slight inaccuracy stemmed from nothing more than the discrepancy between true north and magnetic north. As for the lights, Columbus wrote of seeing \"a great flame of fire\" that crashed into the ocean -- probably a meteor. He saw lights in the sky again on October 11, which, of course, was the day before his famous landing. The lights, brief flashes near the horizon, were spotted in the area where dry land turned out to be.\\n\\nAnother historical event retroactively attributed to the Bermuda Triangle is the discovery of the Mary Celeste. The vessel was found abandoned on the high seas in 1892, about 400 miles off its intended course from New York to Genoa. There was no sign of its crew of ten or what had happened to them. Since the lifeboat was also missing, it is quite possible that they abandoned the Mary Celeste during a storm that they wrongly guessed the ship could not weather. But what makes it even harder to call this a Bermuda Triangle mystery is that it the ship was nowhere near the Triangle -- it was found off the coast of Portugal.\\n\\nThe Bermuda Triangle legend really began in earnest on December 5, 1945, with the famed disappearance of Flight 19. Five Navy Avenger bombers mysteriously vanished while on a routine training mission, as did a rescue plane sent to search for them -- six aircraft and 27 men, gone without a trace. Or so the story goes.\\n\\nWhen all the facts are laid out, the tale of Flight 19 becomes far less puzzling. All of the crewmen of the five Avengers were inexperienced trainees, with the exception of their patrol leader, Lt. Charles Taylor. Taylor was perhaps not at the height of his abilities that day, as some reports indicate that he had a hangover and failed in his attempts to pass off this flight duty to someone else.\\n\\nWith the four rookie pilots entirely dependent on his guidance, Taylor found that his compass malfunctioned soon into the flight. Taylor chose to continue the run on dead reckoning, navigating by sighting landmarks below. Being familiar with the islands of the Florida Keys where he lived, Taylor had reason to feel confident in flying by sight. But visibility became poor due to a brewing storm, and he quickly became disoriented.\\n\\nFlight 19 was still in radio contact with the Fort Lauderdale air base, although the weather and a bad receiver in one of the Avengers made communication very spotty. They may have been guided safely home if Taylor had switched to an emergency frequency with less radio traffic, but he refused for fear they would be unable to reestablish contact under these conditions.\\n\\nTaylor ended up thinking they were over the Gulf of Mexico, and ordered the patrol east in search of land. But in reality, they had been heading up the Atlantic coastline, and Taylor was mistakenly leading his hapless trainees much further out to sea. Radio recordings indicate that some of them suggested to Taylor that Florida was actually to the west.\\n\\nA search party was dispatched, which included the Martin Mariner that many claim disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle along with Flight 19. While it is true that it never returned, the Mariner did not vanish; it blew up 23 secon\n\nAnswer:",

To be honest, I think from your boyfriends parents point of view, your sexuality will over-ride any issues of race. For example, if they are fairly close minded and prejudiced, then they won't accept you on the grounds that you are gay, your race won't come into it. Similarly, if they do welcome you, this means that are open-minded people who won't have an issue with your race since they didn't have a problem with your sexuality. So in short, no I dont think it is harder for non-caucasions, but I imagine it is equally hard for all gay men\n\nAnswer:",

Depending on where you live, lenders typically cannot charge more than 60% interest per annum.\\n\\nLaws against \"usury\" go back to biblical times and were adopted by states starting in the 18th century. The concept was simple: People in dire need of money will pay just about any interest rate to get it. So society moved to protect them from sleazy lenders who threaten to break legs.\\n\\nIn New York, for instance, it's a crime for an individual to charge more than 25% interest on a loan. But what's illegal for a loan shark in New York is perfectly legal for credit card issuers that put their operations in states that have no rate ceilings, such as South Dakota and Delaware. They can charge their customers everywhere whatever they wish, because what counts is the law of the state where their credit card operations are based.\n\nAnswer:",

Corporate animal farms hurt the environment, the consumer and the animals under there control. Therefore corporate animal farms are harmful and should be phased out of there current existence. Consuming factory farmed meat by humans is primarily for pleasure, (it tastes good) and is unnecessary since a plant based diet has been proven to be healthier and can taste great as well. Corporate animal farms consume large amounts of water and other natural resources and produce vast amounts of waste which pollutes the environment. To cause pain and death to an animal and harm the environment for the trivial purpose of pleasuring an individual’s immediate sensual gratification without considering how the product is produced is irresponsible. \\n\\n\\n\\n1) some religion thinks that all animals are living things and thus, they should not be killed. \\n2) in geo, if we eat more meat, more people will have less to eat because of the food pyramid. a cow eats so much plants in a liofe time and the amount of plants can feed so many people but that cow can only feed a few people.\\n3)mad cow disease, H5N1 disease. it's too dangerous. \\n4) extinction, we have to protect them\\n5)with technology, we can produced vegeterian meat, for ex, the canned duck that's made from plants.\\n6)animal waste causes polution.\\n7) there's population explosion going on and land sacarcity, we don't have ebough resources for them.\\n8)The use of horses for meat production is widely opposed in countries such as USA and Britain where horses are considered companion and sporting animals.There is an effort in the United State to create a law, the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act, designed to stop the slaughter of horses.\\nPolls sponsored by various American organisations have shown that most people are not aware that horses are slaughtered in the US for consumption overseas. According to some of these polls, in New York, 64% of people polled actually believed that slaughtering horses for meat was illegal, while in Indiana, 91% believe that horse slaughter should be banned. [7] An overwhelming majority of Texas voters (89%) are unaware that horse slaughter goes on in their own state. [8]\\nFrench animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has spent her latter years crusading against the eating of horse meat.\\n8) there's growing meat lab nowadays and the meat is better.\\n9) it's time that people be more civilise, work in cities instead of farming.\\n10),eet.. especially red meat is very unhealthy. Too mush fats make us fat\\n\\n\\n\\nNO beacuse......\\n1)god gave us these animals to eat.\\n2) we can't be vegeterians. we need the energy.\\n3)if we don't eat them, the food chain will be affect because if there is a raise in the secondary consumer, the number of primary consumer will drop.\\n4)variety of food.\\n5) if the animals, eat all the plants, there will be nothing to hold the soil. \\n6)we do not have enough land for planting crops. example, less than 2/5 of america's fertile land is used for planting but for building things.\\n7) when there is a demand for these animals, more people will have jobs and there will be more animal waste to be used as fertilisers.\\n8)Horse meat is sweet, tender, low in fat, and high in protein.[1] Just like beef and pork, in some societies there is a taboo regarding the consumption of horse meat.\\nHorse meat has had somewhat of a resurgence in popularity in Europe and Canada in recent years, as horses are not susceptible to BSE (mad cow disease).\\nHorse meat has about 40% less calories than even the leanest beef, while supplying 50% more protein and up to 30% more iron.\n\nAnswer:",

What branch pays the most on average?\nAnswer: They all pay the same basic pay.  I'm sure the special pay is different for each service.  You can check out the DFAS website, http://www.dod.mil/dfas/.  If you're concerned about your mortgage, you also get a little thing called BAH, Basic Allowance for Housing.  How much you receive is based on rank and duty location.  It's not based on where you live.  For instance, if you are stationed in a high cost area like Washington DC, you will receive more than someone stationed in Indianapolis.  You can check that out yourself, by choosing a service under military pay information.  Then select \"basic pay\" and then click \"current pay rates\".  You should then see a chart for current pay rates and also information about BAH.  Use the calculator to see how much you would get based on the zipcode.\n\nAnswer:",

To avoid the problem, manufacturers of flash RAM devices can incorporate \"wear leveling\" that remaps the blocks so that writes occur evenly throughout the physical locations of the flash device.\\n\\nDo all modern flash RAM devices use this wear leveling technology?\nAnswer: Interesting idea. I don't know if that's how they do it, but I can see that it would be beneficial.\n\nAnswer:",

What is Emphysema?\\nFAQ\\n\\nFrom Stacey Lloyd,\\nYour Guide to Lung Diseases.\\n\\nA.\\n\\nEmphysema is a lung disease in which the walls of the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs fracture or burst. As these alveoli break, the remaining alveoli become enlarged to make up for the loss. This results in a fewer number of alveoli, with many enlarged. \\nWhen alveoli are enlarged, they loose their elasticity. A loss of elasticity in the alveoli results in the inability to eliminate air from the lungs. Therefore, patients must use force (energy) to expel this air. \\n\\nFurthermore, the loss of elasticity in the lungs affects the smaller bronchial tubes. To push air out of the bronchial tubes, a higher pressure must be developed inside the chest. \\n\\nThis higher pressure tends to collapse the smaller bronchial tubes, making it even more difficult to empty air from the alveoli. \\nCoughing becomes very difficult and ineffective in expelling mucus, leaving the lungs more susceptible to lung infections, such as pneumonia. \\n\\n( http://lungdiseases.about.com/od/emphysema/f/emphysema_expl.htm )\\n\\nWhat causes emphysema?\\nEmphysema can be caused by one or a combination of these things:\\n\\nCigarette smoking: Most cases of emphsyema are caused by cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoke reaches deep into the lungs and causes permanent damage. If you have emphysema from cigarettes, the best way to stop your lung damage is to quit smoking as soon as possible. It's never too late to quit smoking. \\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency: Some people have emphsyema because of a rare genetic disorder called Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency. People with Alpha-1 are missing an enzyme that protects their lungs. Some people with Alpha-1 deficiency get emphysema without ever having smoked. Other people get emphsyema from the combination of smoking and having Alpha-1 deficiency. \\nAir pollution: There is some evidence that air pollution can contribute to people getting emphysema, especially if the person also smokes.

Without sufficient atmospheric pressure, body fluids will start to heat up and boil. Without oxygen, we would be unable to breathe. \\nThe parts of a spacesuit\\n\\nSpacesuits serve many functions. Today's spacesuits are pressurized, have an oxygen supply, protect the astronaut from micrometeoroid bombardment while spacewalking, and insulate the astronaut from the severe temperature changes experienced in space. The Space Shuttle astronauts have more than one \"outfit\" for space travel. What they wear while on a mission is determined by the job they are doing. During the launch and re-entry, the astronauts wear a partially pressurized suit and a parachute pack. The suit has a helmet, gloves, and boots which all serve as protection for the astronaut. Within the suit are bladders that automatically fill with air at reduced cabin pressures. At low pressure, the blood will pool in the lower body causing the astronaut to black out. The bladders maintain the pressure on the lower body to prevent this from happening. While working in the Shuttle during orbit, astronauts work in comfortable clothes such as knit shirts, pants, or flight suits. In addition, prior to each mission, flight crews are outfitted with lined jackets, sleep shorts, slippers, and underwear. \\nWhile working outside of the Shuttle during a mission, astronauts wear an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU). This suit has interchangeable parts so it can be assembled to fit different astronauts. This makes the suit more cost effective since it can be reused. The EMU has a liquid cooling garment, which is a one piece suit made of spandex, and keeps the astronaut cool while in the suit. The unit also contains headphones and microphones, a drink bag which carries water, a life support system containing oxygen, and a urine collection device. Gloves are included with the unit along with a helmet and a visor. All of this is necessary to protect the astronaut from micrometeoroids, solar radiation, infrared radiation, temperature changes, pressure changes, and oxygen deprivation.\n\nAnswer:",

The thing has gotten bigger over time and is now starting to look like the early stages of a pregnancy,.  I cannot wear any of my cute little dresses anymore because the stomach bulge from the tumor is embarassing.  \\nI haven't been to the obgyn in two years because I do not have very good health insurance and it is very expensive.  The last time I did go she just told me that as long as I am not having any complications from it, than there is nothing I should do about it.  I am starting to become embarassed with the way that I look and I want to get rid of it.  I have done some online research about it but it talks about having surgery or getting pills to shrink it.  Surgery is too expensive and I can't afford it and the pills seem like a gimmick.  \\nIs there anything that I can do to rid mysel of this ugly tumor??  Help\\nI am only 30 and I do not want to have to dress like an old lady.\nAnswer: Que paso Stacy,\\n\\nIm drorganico, natural health practitioner for 12 years and have dealt with several dozens cases like yours and every single one of them, when they client followed every step of the protocol that is, has been cleared up with 6 to 8 weeks of detoxing and making the right adjustments in their lifestyles.\\n\\nAs you said, your 30 and lots of carefree living in front of you so please get a hold of your emotions and forget the old lady analogies, lets get you back to the secure and sexy image that you know you have of yourself. This can be dealt with faster than you can imagine. However I do need to mention that lack of action on your part will make not being able to wear cute little things a very minor issue compared to other complications that will certainly come about.\\n\\nForget surgery and forget additional costly \"toxic legal poison\" known as pharmaceuticals prescribed by docs that realy dont know that there are legit, effective and economic solutions that work in harmony with your body, not against it, Ill give you some basic info and if you cant find a decent natural practitioner in your city, and you want some detailed help, contact me through yahoo, my email is listed.\\n\\nStacey, my business slogan is EDUCATE SO AS NOT TO MEDICATE, so bear with me while I give you some basic information so your informed and at least make informed decisions not just heresay, trendy and gossip decisions.\\n\\nThe fibroid tumor is a hard, benign (noncancerous) tumor that generally occurs in the uterine wall. It usually has no toxic effects on the body and causes problems only if it grows large enough to physically encroach on vital structures. If such tumors are present in the uterus as a woman approaches menopause, they may produce abnormal menstrual bleeding. \\n\\nAt times this bleeding can be controlled only by removing the uterus. In many cases, much less extreme and natural measures are more than satisfactory. The cause of fibroid tumors remains medicaly unproven though there are many solid theories. Researchers in my natural health field believe its due to certain trace mineral deficiencies via an imbalance of the body PH, more on that in bit. \\n\\nThe balance of ovarian hormones must play some part in their formation because as a woman goes through menopause, the fibroids present frequently retrogress and atrophy along with the normal shrinking of the uterus.\\n\\nMany tumors are in the early stages respond well to the use of certain detox protocols and trace mineral supplementation, this in combination of consuming less acid forming foods and more alkaline forming foods and the all important stress management aspect which also plays a factor in why these tumors formed in the fist place since its a know scientifica fact that un managed stress releases a large amount of unnecessary acid in your system.\\n\\nTo accomplish this, I recommedn certain detox herbs, supplements with natural detox agents; essential vitamins that reinforce the immune system, vegetable protein and supplementation. \\n\\nThis combined with spiritual reconnection therapy is effective in virtualy all cases within a time frame of 7 days to get rid of pain, 8 to 12 weeks for the enitre detox process to take hold and at about 12 weeks after the process begins get an ultrasound to confirm what you will already know and feel, the tumor has been flushed out naturaly with no drugs or toxins.\\n\\nNow Stacy, about one of the main root causes of your tumor, PH out of balance. Let me explain.\\n\\nThe body is dominated by 2 chemicals, alkaline and acid, when the acid takes over for a considerable length of time the entire cell structure and tissues are deprived of sufficient oxygen, this is called an \"anaerobic enviroment\" this was discovered by 2 time Nobel Prize winner in science and medicine, Dr. Otto Werberg, a German physician that won those prestigious awards in 1931 and then again 1938, he also documented that once you get the PH to get more alk\n\nAnswer:",

I didn't write that!\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, since having a Christ complex is automatically assumed to be prime evidence of psychosis and thinking you're a prophet usually convinces the government of every industrialized country, no matter which one you happen to be in, you're a cult leader who has to be stopped for the social good, any prophet that shows back up at this point to illuminate the word of God will either be labeled a lunatic and locked up in a teeny padded room with a guy knitting a sweater that doesn't exist and another one who thinks he's Napoleon, or else tear-gassed, and either shot on the scene or put on trial and hauled off to prison for the rest of his or her life.\\n\\nPlus, you do have to contend with the pesky fact the Bible says anyone who tries to tell you they know the word of God and that it's somehow different than the Bible is a false prophet trying to lead you to Hell and they'll be cropping up all over the place, while the only guy who can really explain it to you will only show up five minutes after the world ends... so chances are everyone who needs to listen will be busy sticking their fingers in their ears, screaming \"No, NO!  NOT LISTENING, YOU WHORE OF BABYLON!  LA LA LA LA LA!!! NOT LISTENING!!!\"\\n\\nSo who knows, could've been tons of them sent down by God to explain things to us, and we could've just ignored them all.\\n\\nP.S.-- Don't believe me?

Or any other.\nAnswer: Not too bad, some of my friends work for Schlumberger, but it depends on what your job is exactly. If its a basic entry level field engineer you may find that it is quite tough as of the current climate at the moment. In a month expect to be working more than 14 days and not having too much time off. As the oil price is very high, most companies are very busy and thus are the people. Its a great time to get started as you progress much quicker than expected.  Depending on your qualifications, if you have a degree go into M/LWD or if not go into Wireline. Both jobs are good although wireline is a bit more stressful if things are not going to plan. If you want you can email me and I can suggest which companies to apply to.\n\nAnswer:",

Is this true??? Is their something I can do to get my property back ??? Is their any statues that can help and if so what are they ??? I am so lost, I have read so much, talked to so many and still feel lost ... PLEASE HELP .... I am located in florida ...\nAnswer: Not nearly enough facts. If your vehicle was executed against to satisfy a personal judgment against the other party, you could have filed to intervene in your friend's action and quash the execution on grounds that your property interests were being damaged. You could also have offerred to pay the reasonable value for your friend's interest in the vehicle in return for his/her relinquishing title. Then your payment could have been used to satisfy his/her debt to the creditor, and you would have clear sole title to the vehicle. \\n\\nGenerally, a creditor who executes against a vehicle held in joint title must post a bond in case the execution turns out to damage someone else's interests. So, you should still be able to sue the creditor and recover either directly or against the bond.\\n\\nYou'll need an attorney for this one. It's way too complicated for a layperson.\n\nAnswer:",

In much earlier days, the clergy were the only ones who could read and write, so the ppl had to come to church to learn the bible from them. Then, the clergy started reinterpreting things to their own benefit. I think there is a line about every man should have an acre of land, but every clergyman should have 100 square acres. Stuff like that makes it hard to believe any of the rest of the doctored text.  \\n\\nOr, in that show that's on right now about the lost Gospel of Judas, they talk about censorship there as well, where things that don't fit with what the people in power want didn't make it into the next rendition.\n\nAnswer:",

I close my eyes and I see the most magnificent movies. I hear music in my head, unlike any I've heard before.  Being in college, I can't bring myself to do any of my homework for my liberal arts classes. Any time spent not developing my skills in music and art seem wasted. I wonder if I focused on developing my abilities, if I would even need college. Animation and music theory can be learned without college. Many geniouses in the music and art field dropped out of college, or even high-school to pursue their goals. But I love living amougnst my peers.  Am I like a little kid, who wishes he was a rock star.  Am I dillusional, or could I really make it?  Am I just a face in the crowd?  I feel college is holding me back, but I don't want to be a \"failure\" in life. I want to discover my potential within a college-like social environment without draining my life savings or student loans. How can I go about this?\nAnswer: So if you feel like its holding you back, take a break from it.  Go out to Cali, and try to make it big time!  It's the best thing you can do, yer young & Id say do it now, DONT WAIT & dont be one of those people that wonder \"if only .. \"  Say things dont work out, you can always go back to college, it'll always be there. But then again, so will the music career. Hmm .. well good luck!\n\nAnswer:",

He has made enough rich people richer that he keeps getting away with such atrocities as opening up our roadless forests to mining and gas companies, giving away huge tax breaks to the Oil Industry giants, giving tax breaks to companies who move their base of operations out of the U.S. so hundreds of thousands of people lose their good paying jobs, close friends and working with top CEO's of Enron to give them tax breaks and let Enron run Pennsylvania's energy industry before that flopped, to lying to americans and congress about Iraq, war profiteering and the list just goes on and on. Does anyone wonder why Clinton was impeached for lying about sex? And no one questions why Bush has NOT been impeached for war crimes and illegaly wiretapping americans without a warrant? Hmm let's try to figure out which is more serious: sex or war? BIG difference!

Any opinions?\nQuestion: I need to right about what myself and others think about animal rights and cruelty, and if it's right or wrong.\nAnswer: With animal rights and animal cruelty, it's often not a simple 'yes' or 'no' question, not a simple matter of 'right' or 'wrong'.  There are many degrees.\\n\\nIf you are talking about animal rights, what rights should an animal be afforded?  Does an animal have the same rights as a human?  Do all animals get the same levels of rights?  Does a single ant have the same right to life and liberty that a human, or even a dog does?  How about a starfish?  A sponge?  An amoeba?\\n\\nAt what level do you make the arbitrary decision that 'this organism has a right to exist, but this one doesn't?'\\n\\nDoes the Ebola virus have a right to exist and propagate itself?  If you don't agree a virus has the right to live, how about Cochliomyia hominivorax, the human screwworm?  Should you allow treatment of humans infested with intestinal parasites?\\n\\nWhere do you draw the line?\\n\\nThe same can be said for animal cruelty.  Who gets to decide what's cruel?  How exactly do you define cruelty?  Is dropping a kitten in boiling water cruel?  Most people would say yes.  How about dropping a mosquito larva in boiling water?  Or a lobster?  It's cruel to keep a kitten in a jar on your desk, but how about a goldfish?\\n\\nAs with most things in life, there is no easy answer.  Certainly, there should be some benefit, some gain to humanity that must be demonstrated in order to justify killing another organism, but what level of justification is required?  \\n\\nIs squirting caustic substances in a bunny's eyes justified if it means we can develop a substance that won't burn a child's eyes?  \\n\\nIs killing hundreds of thousands, even millions of mosquitoes justified if it keeps one person from dying from West Nile virus?  How about if it means you can have a backyard BBQ without being driven inside by biting flies?\\n\\nIs shooting a deer justified if it means that a family can eat for a month off the meat?  How about if some guy just really wants to kill something and put its head on his rec room wall?  How about if the deer are so overpopulated that they are becoming diseased and the overall health of the whole population is declining because they have eaten all the available forage?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers.\n\nAnswer:",

They give so much love, have could they not survive death?  Just on the energy of that love alone.\\n\\nAnd I do they there soul's can manifest themselves through other pets, like you're cat.\\n\\nMy sympathies to you on losing you're cat, I know how hard that can be.\\n\\nAnd remember, every cat has it's own unique personality.

Wade is overturned?\nQuestion: Many of us take for granted that bans would then be passed in so-called \"red states\"... But what about historically pro-choice states like California? Or New York? What about your state?  For the 33 years since the historic decision of Roe v. Wade, anti-choice extremists have steadily chipped away at a woman's right to choose. But now, two anti-choice Justices have been appointed to the Supreme Court. South Dakota has banned abortion. Louisiana has passed a ban on abortion to go into effect if Roe is overturned. And 12 other states including Ohio, Georgia, and Missouri are considering or have considered similar abortion bans.\\n\\nHow do you feel about this??\nAnswer: It is conceivable that the US Congress might try to pass a law outlawing abortion federally. \\n\\nWomen who have taken their reproductive freedom and personal privacy in this area should be aware that the shrill vocal minority who oppose freedom of choice are doing their best to deprive them of their rights.\\n\\nThe countervailiing position to the argument that a fetus is a human is that, so is the impregnated female. She is not an incubating machine who should have to bear the seed of a rapist or a relative to term just to satisfy the moral smugness of a minority of the populace.\\n\\nolderandwiser is right on.

Just make sure that you make them feel accepted; sometimes, older people are afraid that younger people consider them as inferior and therefore tend to take everything more personally. So treat them like the normal people they are. Remember that they were once babies, once kids, once teenagers, once young adults... So don't try being all \"what can I do for you? Don't do that, you'll hurt yourself\" and stuff like many people tend to do. I know that comes from a good intention, but the truth is, a lot of times, grandparents don't want that from their grandchildren. Sometimes, they just want to be treated as friends, to feel young again... And yes there is a grandparent day. It's september 11, I think.\n\nAnswer:",

The specification of a curve, surface, etc., by means of one or more variables which are allowed to take on values in a given specified range. \\n\\n2. A parameterization of a surface  X(u,v) in uand v is regular if the tangent vectors \\ndX/du and dX/dv are always linearly independent. \\n[THE DERIVATIVE ARE PARTIAL HERE.]\\n\\n3. A surface in 3-space can be parameterized by two variables (or coordinates) u and u such that \\n\\n   (1)  x= x(u,v)\\n   (2)  y= y(u,v)\\n   (3)  z= z(u,v)\\nIf a surface is parameterized as above, then the tangent vectors \\n\\n (4) Tu =   (dX/du)x^ + (dY/du)x^ + (dZ/du)x^ \\n\\n (5)  Tv =  (dX/dv)x^ + (dY/dv)x^ + (dZ/dv)x^ \\nare useful in computing the surface area and surface integral. \\n\\n[Tv means T with suffix v, (dX/dv) means partial derivative of X with v and x^ means x with a cap].\\n\\nSorry, but I can not write euqations so well without equation editor.\n\nAnswer:",

COBRA is a federal mandate for continuing health benefits when a qualifying event occurs such as divorce, for employers with 50 and over full and part time employees.  On the day the divorce becomes final, the employee should notify their employer and paperwork will then be sent to the ex-spouse notifying them of their right to continue medical benefits under the group's plan up to 36 months.  The paperwork must be completed and return within the specified time frame.  The monthly premium payment due is the full amount the insurance carrier charges the employer and the employer can add up to 2% of the cost to administer the paperwork.\n\nAnswer:",

The CDC recommends the use of sexual prophylactics by anyone infected with hepatitis C or any other sexually transmissible disease, but common contact is not dangerous. While it should be kept in mind that there is no known mode of transmission for approximately 10% of cases, this should not be taken as a statement that it can be easily casually acquired. Routine precautions around blood, and avoiding the sharing of toothbrushes, razors, and other personal items should provide adequate protection.\\n\\n\\n\\nA number of agents can cause hepatitis, including infectious diseases, chemical poisons, drugs and alcohol. Hepatitis C is a contagious viral disease that leads to serious, permanent liver damage, and in many cases, death.\\n IV drug users represent the largest single risk group.  Sexual contact has been clearly identified as a means of transmitting hepatitis C.  Household contact with another household member that has hepatitis C has also been strongly implicated, and this, in combination with heterosexual exposure, is believed to be responsible for approximately 13% of all infections.  Around 2% of all cases of hepatitis C are thought to be contracted through the occupational risk (needle-stick injuries, blood spills, etc) involved with the health care profession.\\n\\nPrisoners have enormous incidence of infection - rates reported in some California prisons exceed 80%, with certain institutions reporting nearly 100% of their prisoners infected.\\n\\nSome skin piercing practices, notably tattooing, body piercing, and acupuncture, have contributed significantly to the spread of HCV, particularly in less industrialized nations. Tattooing in particular poses a serious risk. Even in the presence of good sterilization, studies have suggested that the ink used in tattooing can become contaminated and transmit the virus.\\n\\nCocaine users have an abnormally high risk of infection due to the fact that they frequently share snorting straws, which may have small amounts of blood-carrying mucous on them. \\n\\nLess obvious, specialized risk factors have been identified resulting from indirect exposures to blood - including manicures, shared toothbrushes and razors, and straight razors in barber shops.\\n\\nIn many surveys, about a third of people who are alcoholics are also infected with the HCV virus.\n\nAnswer:",

Most objections to the overpromotion of hydrogen have nothing to do with affluence or aversion to hiccups. Rather, the naysayers see hydrogen being touted as THE solution, with scant attention being paid to minor details like where the energy to generate hydrogen comes from. \\nWith current technology, getting energy from hydrogen would merely be displaced combustion of fossil fuels or nuclear energy. It is either extracted from hydrogen bearing molecules like petroleum products or electrolyzed from water. Either way uses more energy than the combustion of hydrogen will repay, even in a relatively efficient fuel cell. Biological methods for hydrogen generation are being proposed but are unlikely to be economically scalable. Without a clean production technology, hydrogen is a net negative. However, hydrogen is intrinsically a clean fuel, and if clean production, transportation and storage can be arranged, it would improve our lives tremendously.\\nOK, with that said, there are many organizations pursuing many alternative energy technologies. \"Prepared\" for oil depletion they are not. But they are working realistically along the many routes available to mitigate the shock of depletion. These include increased energy efficiency (note that the energy you don't use is equvalent to production of that energy with infinite efficiency!), expanded mass transit, and energy sources like biomass, wind, solar, tidal and hydro. Unfortunately, all of these sources have environmental impacts of their own, and some are \"low quality\" in the sense that the power intensity is low, requiring extensive investment in land and equipment. There are many opportunities for people with good ideas to help here. Google alternative energy and find many interesting sites.\n\nAnswer:",

Which is preferred to avoid sin offen?\nQuestion: Both masturbating and promiscuity (that is sleeping with either a man or woman without being formally married) is sinful and both could not be condolled by God hence abstainess from both masturbation and promiscuity is the only way to please God concerning this aspect of sin. As a true believer in the word of God, unmarried man or woman must not indulge in sex until they are married and pronounced husband and wife in the church of God by the Bishop, Apostle, Pastor or any clegy in charge in such a church; or joined in the registery as man and wife or even in the traditional way as it may be in your locality. Nigeria as a case study, marriage could be contracted in the mosque, at the family home of the woman (intended to be married out) whereby all the family members of the woman (both parternal and maternal) and the family of the intended husband will be present to solemnize the two people and they shall become one and live together thereafter as husband and wife.\nAnswer: If you have to choose the lesser evil, than go for masturbation. God's purpose for sex is for procreation between a husband and a wife. Obviously, to have premarital sex sins against the procreation part, and the the being unwed part. Plus, you're involving someone else with your sin. If you're masturbating, you are alone...and you're actually not preventing procreation because there is no woman. \\n\\nGod understands that people have freewill and are generally 'weak'. God wants people to live according to his wishes, but he also understands that it is difficult.\n\nAnswer:",

You can use the information below as a reference to guide yourself and figure out how long derogatory information stays on your credit report\\n\\nGeneral credit information: 7yrs\\nCollections: 7yrs from date of last activity\\nBankruptcy: 10 yrs\\nForeclosure: 12 yrs from the date filed\\nGarnishment: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\\nJudgment: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\\nTax lien: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\\nDismissed garnishments, judgments, and tax liens: not reportable\\n\\nNow that you have this information I’ll give you an example similar to a client. The agent he had worked with before gave him the wrong advice.\\n\\nLets assume that you had a collection for $1,000 filed against you in December 1998 and you haven’t paid it. It’s now November 2005, so in a few weeks that collection can come off your credit report. (You will probably have to request all three credit bureaus to take it off your credit report). However, you just applied for a loan today and the loan officer tells you that you need to payoff that debt in order to be approved. Since you have the money to pay it off, you do so. Because the date of last activity is now November 2005, the collection will show on your report until November 2012 – another additional 7 years.\\n\\nNow let assume that this collection was in June 2005 and you pay it off in November 2005 to obtain the loan, this will reduce your credit score. On the other hand if this collection was in September 2005 and you pay it off in November 2005 to obtain the loan, this will actually increase your score. My point is that a collection account that is less than 6 months old and is paid off will be beneficial but if your collection account is more than 6 months old and is paid off this will be detrimental to your credit score.\\n\\nYou as a consumer can request copies of your credit report from the 3 credit bureaus (although it’s better to get a collective report from all three in one which I can help you with) and dispute information that is incorrect. Incorrect information can be corrected or removed but correct information (good or bad) usually stays on the report for the period allowed. Only the credit grantor (lender/bank) or credit bureau can remove correct information.\\n\\nIf you find incorrect information on your report, contact the credit grantor obtain an explanation, have them corrected and ask them to contact all three credit bureaus and correct that information on your report. After this you should also contact all three credit with a letter with documented proof of the error on your report and ask them to remove this information. The credit bureaus by law have to respond to your letter and request. Depending on your case they might approve or deny your request but they have to respond to your letter. Following are the addresses for all three credit bureaus.\\n\\nTrans Union\\nPO Box 4000\\nChester, PA 19022\\n866-887-2673\\nhttp://www.transunion.com/\\n\\nExperian\\nPO Box 2002\\nAllen, TX 75013\\n888-397-3742\\nhttp://www.experian.com/\\n\\nEquifax Credit\\nPO Box 740241\\nAtlanta, GA 30374\\n800-685-1111\\nhttp://www.equifax.com/\n\nAnswer:",

I don't know where to find him.\nAnswer: Please don't be misled by the previous responder. You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce where ever he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce.\n\nAnswer:",

I have a LOT of fears and suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks, for which I'm on medication and under the care of a psychiatrist.\\n\\nOne of my main fears seems to be a fear of the dark. I haven't always been scared of the dark, this has only been over the past year or two and seems to be getting worse. I get really panicky when it's dark - I have to have a baby's night light in my room at night or I have a panic attack as soon as I put the light off. But there are other situations which can be embarrassing - the other night I was watching TV with my flatmate and he put the light off......I managed to cope OK until he switched off the TV and we were plunged into darkness, then I got really panicky and it was embarrassing to say the least.\\n\\nHow can I get over this? I feel like such a baby!\nAnswer: well firstly and most importantly stop feeling embarassed... i am 27 and afraid of the dark since i was a little girl... so? what? since it's not something that you have since childhood probably your generalised anxiety triggered it as well as other fears and phobias too. so feeling embarassed just makes you feel more anxious and therefore intesifies your fear of dark. leave a small light on in your room (like a baby's night light) and try one step at the time. For example try not to lock your door once or twice a week. Admit to your flatmates you are afraid of dark. When you ll do that you will find out they are afraid of other things too or maybe that they even share the fear of darkness. This will allow you to be less anxious and them being more considerate. Over the years I have realised that you have to manage your fears like climbing. Rule number one: admit the mountian is high! Rule number 2: never look at the top. Always focus on the little step you take. You ll reach the top before you know it...\n\nAnswer:",

Isn't that a personal thing.  Why do \"gay\" people feel they have to \"come out of the closet?\", discuss their sex life, etc to the media?  Maybe all the \"straight\" people should start publicly speaking on their sex life?\nAnswer: You are so right - a person's sexual orientation should not matter.\\n\\nAs for coming out of the closet - most of the time the gays are simply doing the same thing that straights do all the time: talking about thier family and/or loved ones. When we are talking about media stars - it seems the public has an interest in who is dating/marrying who, etc. Should they only ask those questions to straights? Should gays have to lie when asked these questions?\\n\\nStop and think about a typical Monday conversation - talking about what you did over the weekend and usually who you did it with. How it is somehow wrong for a gay man to say that he and his partner went out to dinner and a movie Saturday night but ok for a straight man to say he and his wife did? Do you want the gay man to lie and say he and his \"roommate\" went so that you will feel more comfortable?  \\n\\nIt's not like being gay is only about sex - like everyone else - sex is only about 10% of a person/relationship. I'd rather focus in on the other 90% of a person.  I just don't get what all the fuss is about - being gay is not contagious.\n\nAnswer:",

I've been having this problem for several years.  I've lost jobs and being seen by professionals to determine IM not parrinod.  My car will weigh more then normal sometimes when I do my daily life.  I noticed that strange people are around when I park my car at Public places.  The people wait untill I go into my place of employment or other public places,video store,grocery store,mall etc.  The car is caring something that makes it feel heavy.  I have checked everyplace and ask others to help in finding whatever it may be.  I have weighed my car at the local dump and it sometimes does have extra weight and it varies.  I know this sounds crazy but what would someone do besides let it keep happening.  It gets put onto my car most weekends and other days during the week.  No pattern and I have stopped going to work and any other trips I dont have to do.  I spoke with an officer local and he suggested\nAnswer: Rob,\\nYour dog, Dexter is a double agent.

Eventually the decline becomes severe enough to interfere with daily activities and social relationships. \\nMany of the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are similar to the memory loss that occurs with normal aging, such as forgetting something you said earlier in the day. \\n\\nMore troubling symptoms may include: \\n\\nforgetting information you've just learned \\ndifficulty remembering the names of familiar objects \\nworsening confusion \\nchanges in behavior and personality \\na gradual inability to perform basic tasks \\nOf course, even symptoms characteristic of Alzheimer's disease may have other causes, such as a prescription medication. As you get older, your ability to metabolize medication changes. The dosage of a medication that was prescribed even a year ago may no longer be appropriate, resulting in symptoms such as confusion. \\n\\n\\nReaching a diagnosis\\nIf memory lapses or related symptoms begin to interfere with your daily life, consult your doctor. Often, input from loved ones and other close contacts can help the doctor determine the severity of your memory loss and other symptoms. \\nDiagnosing Alzheimer's disease can be stressful and time-consuming for both patients and their families. Proper diagnosis is the key to treatment and planning, however. And the sooner the better. Treatment is most effective when it begins in the early stages of the disease.\n\nAnswer:",

The relgious facists wanting dominance. ie islamic, kkk etc violence. State sponsored (see School of the Americas) and what is effectively freedom fighters.\\n\\nThe latter do things like take hostages to demand troops out of their country Ie quit bombing our people.\\n\\nOr free their people etc, or equality etc.\\n\\nOften terrorisim comes about as a reaction to oppression.\\n\\nFor example in Iraq there are the insurgents. Basically just wanting the americans etc to piss off and leave them along, stop nicking their oils and oppressing them.\\n\\nAnd the religious extreamists who seek an islamic state (very bad)... this leads to the likes of the taliban in control which oppressed women and gays.\\n\\nLook up what the taliban did ie stone to death\\n\\nhttp://www.iran-e-azad.org/stoning/video.html\\n\\nany girl for having sex outside marriage or even walking outside a house without a brother/husband or father.\\n\\nhttp://www.soaw.org/new/\\nwww.guardian.co.uk/waronterror/story/0,1361,583254,00.html\\n\\nIf you look at the conflict between between the palestinians and the isrealis it started due to the israelis taking control of the palestinians land, throwing them out of their homes into the gutters and camps with no toilets, or decent conditions, then building settlements (ie nice houses with swimming pools) on the stolen land in sght of the palestinians, Living in tents with open sewage, little medical treatment, awful lives etc etc, constantly bullied.. Tand then gloating from their nice homes at those who got kicked out of their homes. so the Palestinains pissed off. Faught back only they didn't have tanks,and f16 jet fighters and aircraft carriers so they hijacked planes etc instead.\\n\\nAs this went on with generations growing up very upset in these horrible conditions. Islamic relgious groups moved in offering schools and help But as incharge of education. Fill kids with stories of how perfect their relgion is, how evil the jews are and that they must not think and obey Islam. And that they will meet many virgin girlfriends if they kill as many jews as possible, blowing themselves up or shooting.\\n\\nBasically bring kids up to be weapons.\\n\\nThey target civilians partly as All isrealis have to join the army so theirfor discos are full of 'soldiers' off duty to them.\\n\\nPlus saying we are going to make life so horrible you will get fed up and go away... in simple terms.\\n\\nUnfortunetley this has gone on so long that all there is is hate on both sides and the relgious leaders are in control.\\n\\nAmerica you will find is often in up to its neck in opressing people by way of (see school of the americas) putting in place dictators to opress people in return for cheap oil.\\n\\nMuch of terrorisim are locals fighting mining companies taking their countries minerals and hurting therm and making them poor. These mining companies mines (and other buinesses that exploit, are termed 'american interests' \\n\\nAnd if american (and uk) forces are not sent in to defend said 'interests' (ie beating up the locals to protect a business thats treating the locals like shit and killing them, They fund and pay and help a nasty dictator to do it for them.\\n\\nA bit like helping the mafia run a town in r\n\nAnswer:",

They also share all the other characteristics of birds, being warm-blooded (around 40 deg C) and having a reduced reproductive system (one functional ovary or testis).\\nLike all other birds, penguins have feathers. Penguin feathers are short, overlapping and densely packed. The outer part of the feather is waterproof while the inner down section traps an insulating layer of air, keeping the penguin warm in the sometimes freezing water. Unlike those of flying birds, the feathers on a penguin wing are very short.\n\nAnswer:",

My boyfriend lived in Wisconsin and so I was planning on moving to Milwaukee with him and eventually going to school there. We'll both be moving into the city without jobs right away but should have one within a month.\\n\\nI currently have bills that total to about 400 dollars a month.\\n\\nAs far as moving expenses, there will be none other than gas as I will be having family help me move everything.\\n\\nWhat do you think would be an appropriate amount of money to be saved considering the circumstances?\nAnswer: You will need at least first, last months rent and maybe enough for a security deposit. That could be anywhere from 1400 to 2100 dollars. Turning on your utilities usually has a charge as well so save about a 100 for that. I would also suggest saving the 400 that you will need to your already existing bills plus another 200 for food and miscellaneous items. I am assuming that your boyfriend will split the apartment costs with you evenly so you need $1,100 each for the apartment and an additional $600 on your part for your food and outstanding bills. I would aim for about $2000 in case it takes longer to find a job or at least so you can guarantee paying your second month of rent if you had just gotten a job when rent was due.

It takes away from what we as legal US Citizens pay for. A wall is a good idea, but they will probably find a way over it. Illegal should be against the law and we shouldn't waste our tax dollars taking care of them in jail when they get picked up. I think they should be deported too thier own country at their own expense or to the expense of their country. If the Coutries of origin start getting hit in the pocket book. They will tighten up on their own borders and maybe between the wall and monetary fining it might slow down illegal immigrants. I could go on forever. But I agree with you and probably 50 percent of the rest of the US population. Not to mention the jobs they take because 10 illegals will do the work of one man in a fraction of the time for the same pay or less. Fines for employers and stiff fines should be implemented. NO EXCEPTIONS!!!!! okay have to stop now.\n\nAnswer:",

But so does the Earth. I mean, when a meteor falls to Earth, it never flies back up, does it? People have this idea that black holes are somehow different because even light cannot escape their gravity. If light cannot escape, nothing else can either, so the black hole will eventually eat all the matter in the universe, right? Well, light can escape from Earth but nothing else can, at least not naturally. Meteors fall to Earth all the time and they have no rocket engines so they can never escape. This is true for any matter that falls to Earth. It can never escape. And the Earth is not eating all the matter in space, so why would you think a black hole would?\n\nAnswer:",

I have seen patients with that sort of heart rate and it feels like the pulse is vibrating rather than beating.  Even with a stethoscope it was impossible to count the heart rate.  Only with the use of EKG equipment did we get an actual accounting of the heart rate.  Secondly it is very unlikely that your heart is beating like that and you are not symptomatic in any way (lightheadedness, shortness of breath, nearly passing out, chest pain).  I'm not saying it couldn't happen but it doesn't exactly add up.  \\n\\nADDENDUM:  You say you are getting 64 beats in 15 seconds - as I said above, I have tried to take someone's pulse whose heart was moving that fast and could not discern a pulse.  At that rate your heart does not have time to fill with blood to even produce a full pulse.\\n\\nThe EKG's you had were static, that is you were not moving.  You do need a work up by a cardiologist.  There is a test called a tilt table that can replicate the action of you bending over while you are hooked up to the monitoring equipment.  I would bet this is a supraventricular tachycardia.  If it is there is a procedure - ablation therapy - that can complete cure the problem for life without medication.  Until then there are medications that can control the rate.  Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

I know it's been a month since the incident with their dog but I feel more confident now about doing it and I decided I'm only going to sue them for $900 dollars.  They sent me a certified letter saying that I told them their dog didn't break the skin on my leg, which I did say but the ER doctor said I was lucky that he didn't tear into me.  That is why I'm suing.  I wrote exactly that as the facts for the basis of my claim in the lawsuit: to take to court : The ER dr. said it was lucky he didn't tear into me.  The dog didn't break skin and I know he couldn't see who I was in the dark in front of his house and their usually are lots of dogs barking in the neighborhood so at first I didn't think anything of it.   Just the fact that I had to go through that should be fact enough for lawsuit. Also my ER bill was 400 but only because of a waiver.  Had I had insurance it would have been $900 so thats what Im suing for\nAnswer: You idot.\\n\\nThis is the reason my insurance goes up! Cuz I have to pay for a dumbass like yourself who wants to make a few quick bucks.\\n\\nIf you are having such money problems - get a second job. Or, move back in with your parents. Or, go to a homeless shelter. But, don't make my life miserable because you decided to have kids before you were ready.\\n\\nAnd, no, you won't win. \\n\\nWhat was your injury?\\n\\nIn order to have standing to sue you must prove you had an injury. If the dog did not break the skin, and you stated this to the doctor (duh), you have no standing. Your case will be dismissed via summary judgment.\n\nAnswer:",

A typical person can handle about 5 g (50 m/s²) before this occurs, but through the combination of special g-suits and efforts to strain muscles —both of which act to force blood back into the brain— modern pilots can typically handle 9 g (90 m/s²) sustained (for a period of time) or more. Resistance to \"negative\" or upward gees which drive blood to the head, is much less. This limit is typically in the -2 to -3 g (-20 to -30 m/s²) range. The vision goes red and is also referred to as a \"red-out\". This is probably due to capillaries in the eyes bursting under the increased blood pressure. Humans can survive about 20 to 40 g instantaneously (for a very short period of time). Any exposure to around 100 g or more, even if momentary, is likely to be lethal.\n\nAnswer:",

This is an estimate, of course, as there is no way to track polygamists for sure.  The marriage ceremonies aren't legal so they are done in privacy and the families usually live separately from one another, so there's no way to know for sure who's a polygamist and who isn't.  A majority of polygamists live in Utah, but they can also be found throughout the country.  There are also \"polygamist cities\" such as Colorado City in Arizona and Bonners Ferry in Idaho where the majority of the population pracitices polygamy.\n\nAnswer:",

A question may arise however... do you have a debit card with your checking account, that works as a Visa or MasterCard? It's been a while since I went through the verification process, but I think they want you to enter one to verify your street address is valid.\\n\\nThat said, once you're in, you can apply for the PayPal debit card, which functions just like a MasterCard.\\n\\nIf there is a chance that you will want to do anything money-related online, I would sign up for the Business account. This way if you ever want your own website, or perhaps become an eBay seller, then people don't have to have PayPal accounts to pay you, they can use any of the \"Big Four\" credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover)\\n\\nAn added bonus: If you sell at least 2 items per week on eBay, you will get cash-back bonuses on all your PayPal debit card purchases.\\n\\nBonus 2: Any funds in your PayPal account will earn Money Market interest rates.\n\nAnswer:",

Option: Society & Culture, Science & Mathematics, Health, Education & Reference, Computers & Internet, Sports, Business & Finance, Entertainment & Music, Family & Relationships, Politics & Government.\nQuestion: what is the advantage and disadvantage of nuclear energy?\nAnswer: Advantages:\\n\\nFuel is cheap. Unlike other types of electricity generation only a tiny proportion of the cost of generating nuclear power is in the actual fuel burned. \\n\\n\\nFuel is very easy and cheap to transport. A coal or gas power station will burn tonnes of fuel every day. A nuclear power station will burn only a few grams. Because so little fuel need sot trannsported the amount of auilliary grenhouse gas pollution form transport is almost nil, as opposed to thousands of tonnes a year from coal or gas transport.\\n\\nSafe. Coal or gas power is a highly dangerous way to generate gas. In the US alone dozens of people are killed each year mining and transporting coal and gas for power generation and hundreds more die as a result of the pollutants these stations produce. If the same amount of power were generated using nuclear stations fewer than 10 people would die. \\n\\nAccidents in nuclear power generation is also far less likely to result in a loss of life. Chernobyl was the worst accident ever in the history of nuclear power generation and killed less than 50 people. There have been numerus mine accidents in the US that have killed more than 10 people at a time.\\n\\nUnder safety I will also include the very low levels of radioactivity released. In the US alone around 10 people a years are killed by radioactive materials released by coal power stations. Nobody in the US has ever been killed by radioactive material from nuclear power stations. Fewer than 100 people have been killed by the radioactive material released by nuclear power stations in the last 50 years in the entire world. \\n\\n\\nNon-polluting. Aside from making nuclear power generation very safe the almost total lack of unintentional pollutants is a major environmental bonus for nuclear power. Nuclear power stations contribute just 1/100, 000th of the amount of greenhouse gas as a coal or gas plant generating the same power.\\n \\nAbundant fuel. The world has about enough liquid rude oil to practically last about another 100 years at current consumption and extraction rates. Coal will see us through another 400 years if we sue it as an oil supplement. We have sufficient fissionable material available to provide 10, 000 years of nuclear power even if we abandon coal and oil altogether and get ALL our energy from nuclear power.\\n\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nWaste disposal. This is the biggest problem. Nuclear power plants produce radioactive material that takes thousands of years or longer to become safe. Until it does decay to a safe level it has to be stored where it can’t contaminate the water supply or stolen by people who want to use it as a poison. That requires either the construction of expensive containment facilities or the permanent lockdown of decommissioned stations so the material can be stored on site.\\n\\nStations are relatively expensive to build. Due to pressure from environmental lobby groups nuclear power stations are more heavily regulated than any other industry, far more heavily regulated than coal power stations or even coal mines and far more heavily indicated than the statistical danger warrants. IN addition any proposed nuclear power station will be the target of protests, endless legal challenges and direct acts of sabotage from ‘environmentalists’. Those factors make it far more expensive to build a nuclear power station in the US than to build a coal or gas station.\\n\\nPortability. Nuclear power requires nuclear reactors, big nuclear reactors. That means they are restricted to use in large ocean going vessels, trains and as stationary electrical generators. You can’t use nuclear power to directly power cars, trucks, and airplanes. That means that nuclear power can never directly replace a large amount of US fossil fuel use. The issue of portability can be offset somewhat by using nuclear electricity to convert plant material or even air and water into petroleum, but doings o is fairly expensive.\n\nAnswer:",

He famously vomited on the hallowed Adelaide Oval turf in a WSC game in 1988 before a live nationwide TV audience of millions (he went on to make 122 and win Man Of The Match).\\n\\nMore recently he became the face of Victoria Bitter (VB) beer for its 2005/06 summer advertising campaign, called Boonanza. Part of the promotion was the sale of a talking David Boon figurine with purchases of beer, which would make comments when prompted by Channel Nine commentary. Boon played himself in the television advertisements. This was a controversial choice, as Boon achieved much fame and notoriety for consuming 52 cans of beer on a flight between London and Sydney before the victorious Ashes tour that saw Australia regain the trophy after five years of English dominance. VB denied the story, though chose Boon as a representative (often jokingly referred to as the \"Keg on Legs\") because of his legendary drinking exploits and dogged, iconoclasic batting displays.\\n\\nMore here:\\nhttp://www.thefanatics.com/content.php?id=330\\nhttp://beebo.org/smackerels/david-boon.html\n\nAnswer:",

I was my face every morning and ever night and I wear lancome and clinique makeup that is makeup fee I don't know what to do all around my chin is breaking out. Any sugjestions?\nAnswer: Hi BabyDoll\\n\\nHere are some real answers on skin conditions. Remedies at the bottom. \\n\\nCleansing the body of toxins is the key. Especially a colon cleanse! Educate yourself on detoxifying the blood.\\n\\nJudyth Reichenberg-Ullman N.D. - \"What is your skin trying to tell you? Often the skin is a metaphor for deeper issues and a way for your body to send up a red flag to warn you that all is not well underneath. When our skin is unhealthy it is usually a reflection of the internal state of our bodies, and is often a sign of poor elimination of toxins and waste products. Most of us are embarrassed by skin problems such as rashes, boils or acne, especially in places where others can see our imperfections. The skin is the body's first line of defense against the environment. It has to deal with the effects of weather, sun , cold, heat, dryness, humidity, scrapes, bumps, soaps, detergents, chemicals, perspiration and dirt of all kinds. It is a wonder that our skin stays healthy most of the time! We can help our skin deal with this onslaught by optimizing our general health and by protecting our skin from harsh environmental exposure. Western medicine generally treats skin eruptions with either antibiotics, cortisone, or antifungal preparations. These medicines may alleviate the skin problem temporarily, or occasionally for good, but do not address the source of the problem. Putting a lid on skin symptoms without getting to the root of the imbalance may even result in suppression, that means the imbalance may be driven deeper causing more serious health problems later without ever strengthening the underlying vital force of the person. Fortunately, naturopathic medicine offers a wide vareity of effective treatments for skin problems.\"\\n\\nJudyth Reichenberg-Ullman N.D. - \"Your skin is a reflection of how well your body is eliminating the toxins that build up on a daily basis. Chronic skin conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis stem from a combination of genetic factors, immune stress, dietary deficiencies or sensitivities, and the accumulation of toxins in the body. For our skin to be radiant and clear, it is very important that the other organs of elimination (kidneys, liver, lungs, and colon) are cleansing the body effectively. If not, the skin will be overtaxed, pores will become clogged, and eruptions of one sort or another will result. Here are a number of steps you can take to improve your body's overall elimination wtih specific emphasis on your skin.\" \\n\\nDetoxification is a normal body process of eliminating or neutralizing toxins through the colon, liver, kidneys, lungs, lymph and skin. Fasting is the world's most ancient and natural healing mechanism. Fasting triggers a truly wondrous cleansing process that reaches right down to each and every cell and tissue in the body. \\n\\nLearn more about Therapeutic Fasting and Detoxification - Internal Cleansing \\n\\nNatural Cures\\n\\n1. Fruits and Vegetables for Acne: Carrot & spinach, celery & watercress, grapefruit juices are all useful to combat acne. \\n\\n2. Unwholesome Foods: Acne, a prevalent problem among teen-aged boys would not be possible in our society if our foods were wholesome. A most sad and disgusting sight is the pus-filled pimples due to inner toxicity --- wastes trying desperately to escape through the face. This condition often turns a gentle face in the blossom of youth into a waste dump of pimples, pus and subsequent pock marks which can be prevented. The tons of acne medications and prescriptions sold annually act only on the effect of the harmful food, and not the cause of the disease, malnutrition. The traditional teenage meal, a grease burger, french fries and a milk shake or cola simply does not provide enough nourishment for anyone, let alone a boy going through puberty to adulthood. Our highly processed foods are devoid of hormones found in fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds. **Must do a colon cleanse to \n\nAnswer:",

And it has become really hard to get my teeth clean. Why is this?\nAnswer: Most likely, you are developing gingivitis. It often can be reversed by adopting good dental hygiene habits, which include regular brushing and flossing, as well as twice-yearly dental visits for thorough teeth examinations and cleaning. Once you begin treatment, you will need to continue to see your dentist regularly in order to reverse gum disease. Also, incorporate an anti-gingivitis mouth wash, if you haven't already.\n\nAnswer:",

I called to ask if there were mild stomach flus going around.  I've been having problems with nausea, some vomiting, queasiness, especially when I think about most foods, stomach pain, and difficulty burping.  I also have a lot of low back pain but that may be unrelated.  When my stomach hurts I sometimes lay down and apply a bit of pressure to my stomach and diaphragm.  They feel quite hard.  \\n\\nMy doctor tells me that problems with the gallbladder can run a whole range of symptoms from mild to severe attacks.  Does anyone have some info. that you could share with me?  The online sites I've been to don't really cover the range of severity.  I have to wait another month for my ultrasound.  That seems excessively long to me.  That's our universal healthcare system for you.\nAnswer: Risk factors:\\nBeing overweight \\nAge- older than 65 \\nFatty diet \\nGenetics \\nBeing a Native American or Hispanic \\nHaving sickle cell anemia \\nCrash dieting \\n\\nSince obesity is so closely linked, maintaining a normal weight is an important, especially for women. Avoiding high-fat meals and \"yo-yo\" weight-loss diets are also good ideas. If your background places you at high risk, avoid taking birth control pills or estrogen.\\n\\nIf your doctor thought that your attacks were on the severe side, or life threatening, he would have you in for an ultrasound immediately.  Try avoiding any fatty or sugary foods at least until you get in.\n\nAnswer:",

Merely inserting the CD while running windows will not give you this menu.  \\n\\nMost computers have the ability to boot off cd, but some have this feature disabled.  If you leave the CD in your drive and restart your computer and you get a Press any key to boot from CD message then you're in the clear.  You won't (usually) need to press F6 to add any SCSI controllers and you'll want to do an advanced install, not an upgrade.  From that menu it should give you a screen that lists you partitions and there should be an option to delete the partitions and yes recreate them.  \\n\\nThis is not a trivial task even if you don't have to change your BIOS options to allow CD Booting.

I lost my best friend in Iraq and i want others opinion on the war.?\nAnswer: Former Secretary of State Powell did say 'if we break it, we own it'!  How true those words now are!\\n\\nThe war in Iraq is a direct result of a misguided, misinformed, selfish, and arrogant administration.  Sadly enough in 2004, a slim majority gave this administration four more years to perpetuate and exacerbate this conflict.  \\n\\nThe people in this administration used the 9/11 attacks to implement a pre-conceived agenda.  Virtually the entire world was in our corner following the devious terrorist attacks.  The support was there to bring those responsible to justice.  Yet, this administration squandered that global support at the expense of our credibility as a nation, and more importantly, at the expense of our brave men and women in uniform.  \\n\\nThey used fear as their primary tool to convey their argument for war.  This fear was further extended by lying to us as a nation as well as to the global community, by suggesting that a link existed b/w Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's regime.  Such an assertion was completely false and baseless, yet we were sold anyway.  Without delving too deeply,  the premise for war morphed time after time.  The terrorist link, weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi liberation, democratization of Iraq, etc. were all given as reasons/justification for war.  \\n\\nThe initial lies were uncovered so the premise needed to change.\\nAnd change again!  Yet, the U.S. is not that good at nation building.  It's not our place nor our business.  If it is, why aren't we doing more in the Sudan?  How about North Korea perhaps?.  More importantly, the invasion of Iraq has distracted us from what should be our true objective.  That is, bringing the bastards responsible for 9/11 to justice! \\n\\nThis is an unjust and unnecesary adventure we are on. Furthermore, the invasion was a violation of international law.  Sprinkling freedom dust isn't the answer.  Conducting ourselves  as a responsible/law abiding and just nation, should be the example being set.  Furthemore, we eventually become immune to fear tactics.  When is the last time we had a terror alert by the way?  Before the 2004 election I believe!    Hmmmmm.?\\n\\nYour friend deserved better from our leaders.  We all do!\n\nAnswer:",

He was the first to suggest that we go through psychological stages and he helped us to understand the development between these and how we should properly prepare our children so they do not become fixated with one or more stage. He introduced the Ego, Id and SuperEgo and explained how each has it's own driving force and needs. When Freud explained everything was somehow driven by some sort of sexual desire he brought sex to the minds of everyone. He was one of the first people to look at sexual desire as a normal thing, and not as a taboo. This encourage other psychologist to look into sexual desires, as well, and thats partially why its not so taboo now-a-days. I would further my research on the subject, however, if I were you. It's been over a year since I've learned about psychology theories and I might be a little off.\n\nAnswer:",

Are those some special effects used by the democrats to undermine their arguments???\nAnswer: The Earth's climate in general is going slowly thru a warming phase much as it has many times. How do you think the ice age ended? Global warming... way before man could have possibly affected the climate. Global warming comes from the sun, period. There are a few slight factors involved. Greenhouse gasses, such as carbom dioxide, hold the Earth's heat from escaping back into space. Gasses commonly called pollution, such as sulfur dioxide, reflect the sun's energy back into space. Here's where it gets tricky... over the last 30 years or so, we've cleaned up the pollution but have added more carbon dioxide to the Earth's atmosphere. Now, more of the sun's energy reaches the surface and more is held in, hence \"global warming\". \\n\\nFor the second part of your question... All of the so-called \"experts\" predicted a nasty hurricane season again this year. What happened? Did the republicans somehow blow the hurricans back out to sea to increase their chances of re-election? If so, they should have advertised it, 'cause they didn't do so well...\n\nAnswer:",

Who cares if one parties, or if you kissed one, or if one is a sweetheart.  You're the only person that can, and should decide which boy you decide to date.  If you really need help deciding, then obviously neither of them is so impressive to you that they stand out and you shouldn't date either.\n\nAnswer:",

Now the big question is, how can I download the two disc of files I saved onto my computer? I tried to open up the files but each time it pops up more little files.

Is there an easy way to do this?? \\n\\nAdditional Details\\n\\n2 hours ago\\n**Please, simple answers with steps, thanks.\\nI put my files in (my documents) now how do I download it to my computer?\nAnswer: If you didn't use a backup wizzard to create your backed up files, then you will not be able to put them back properly.

Here's some advice:\\n\\nLet things go by her time.  Relationships are the definitely the result of a mutual interest and effort to get closer to each other.  You have that desire, and now she just needs to spend some time with you to see that you have it, and then she needs to discover for herself if she is willing. \\n\\nAt the same time, you don't want to completely leave the ball in her court.  Girls don't like that anyways, even though that is often what happens.  When you call her, make sure she knows that YOU will call her back.  When you hug her, you let go first.  You know what I mean? Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

And whats the typical lifespan.?\nAnswer: Typically your machine should last anywhere from 3 to 5 years and possibly even beyond. I have a new PC, but I also use my old one and it's from 1999. It's got some quirks but it still runs pretty well. Old age will kill it eventually I know, but for the most part PCs should last a good long time. \\n\\nOne recommendation is to leave your computer running most of the time. You put more wear and tear on it by starting up and shutting it down than you do by just leaving it running, so if possible- just let it run.\\n\\nAlso after 3 or 4 years you're probably going to NEED a new machine anyhow, simply because there'll be a new version of Windows, new devices your computer can't accomodate, new software that can't run on older machines, etc.\\n\\nBut if you're just wondering how long you can expect your machine to run, I'd say if you take care of it, it could last at least 4 or 5 years and possibly more.\n\nAnswer:",

Dispite this When I was 6 years old I wanted a picture of Jesus on the cross. I wanted to see the blood and I wanted to see the lifeless look on his face. I wanted to see the nails through him and the blood running down. Why am I like this? Why am I afraid to let a Christain look into my eyes? I've always been afraid to discuss this with my family so that is why I came here. Please give me an answer I really don't understand this..\nAnswer: It does not sound like a logical fear to me.  Then again this is coming from a guy scared of heights.\\n\\nPerhaps you are scared that they are going to enslave you with their religion.

The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\\n\\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\\n\\nThings to keep in mind:\\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\\n\\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\\n\\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

At the top of the hill the car's speed is 6m/s and at the bottom it is 20m/s. How much energy was cinverted into heat on the way down?\nAnswer: Total energy at the start is equal to the gravitonal potential energy plus the initial kinetic energy. That equals 320000j + 14400j. At the bottom of the hill, the kinetic energy is 160000j and there is no more potential energy. The amount of energy lost to friction, in the form of heat, is 174400 joules.\n\nAnswer:",

It has been agreed for eons that no species will be allowed to leave their home star system if they insist on taking their gods with them. Humans may not have to worry about that, however. Over the centuries, your planet was a curious place to visit once or twice and was not considered very interesting . Sure, your wars showed us how undeveloped you are as a species.  Your infantile,(in cosmic terms) dependence on god concepts does not bode well for you and neither does your penchant to breed beyond your planet's ability to sustain you. We are now showing an interest in you because it is not often that we get to observe a species commit suicide. You are so close to maturing as a sentient species and it will be a shame to see you kill yourselves. There are just not enough of you becoming rational enough to force the issue. You let the least among you determine your fate, so be it.\n\nAnswer:",

Problem is, I get really nervous when standing in front of a class to present. My English teacher gave us some helpful hints as to not getting shy and nervous in front of the class, but can anyone else explain a bit more thoroughly? Thanks in advance.\nAnswer: I am a teacher who also gets very nervous when doing a presentation or workshop in front of my peers, so try these tricks:\\n\\n1) Practice, practice, practice.  Rehearse in front of your family, friends, a mirror, whatever.  The more you know the material, the easier it will come.  Alot of the times you may get nervous because you are afraid you are going to screw up or look silly.  If you have what you are going to say down, that should help.  \\n\\n2) Before you go up, use the restroom.  On the way there, take big strides and swing your arms steadily.  Your goal here is to burn off the extra adrenaline and rthe exercise will help you relax.\\n\\n3) I cannot remember the proper name for this technique, but it DOES work.  Breathe in, tighten your stomach muscles, working from the top ones down to the bottom ones.  What you are doing is burning off excess adrenaline and at the same time breathing slower and deeper.  I use this one every time and it works great.  Once you have finished with the bottom muscles, exhale and repeat.\\n\\n4)  Relax...Breathe in slowly, hold your breath for 4 to 5 seconds, then slowly exhale.\\n\\n5)  Remember... that nobody sitting there is judging you.  They all understand how nerve racking it can be to speak in public.  They want you to succeed.\\n\\n6)  Pick one friendly, smiling face in the crowd and focus on that one person.  This doesn't mean that you don't scan the room and present to the class, but always return your focus to that one person and you will be ok.\\n\\nHope this helps!\\n\\n\"There are two types of speakers: those that are nervous and those that are liars\". - Mark Twain\n\nAnswer:",

Even Wikipedia, but always take wikipedia with a grain of salt, since it's nonprofessional and many professors don't accept citations from it.\\n\\nThe gas laws should be pretty well covered in an elementary chemistry textbook.  I really can't recall if such a book would cover Fickian diffusion, but Dalton's law and Henry's law should be in there as well.  If you have a chapter in your course textbook about blood chemistry, that might be a place to look, as Dalton's law deals with the partial pressure of gases, and Henry's law with the solubility of gases in liquids.  Fick's law would certainly be covered in any references about the lungs.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you think Madrassas are to blame or is it just an idea of western media to give muslims a bad name. I am not a muslim but I have a muslim friend who feels that way.\nAnswer: It is the paranoia of Americans and the West itself. \\nOur Muslim brothers are very well-educated and overwhelming majority of them have stood against violence and hatred incited by others.\\nSuch great thinkers as Avicenna (founder of modern medicine), Alfraganus (whose astronomic works were laid as foundation for Dante Alighieri's Divina Commedia), Al-Horezmi(whose works are the basis of today's algoritm and IT at all) and many more thousands have studied in madrassa. Are they terrorists? \\nHow many of Western people have memorized at least one chapter of Bible, how many Christians read Bible AT ALL? How many of them follow the Ten Commandments by Moses or teachings of Jesus? Unlike those many people who have tried to answer the question above without even being to madrassa or knowing their graduates, I would state that it would be a grave mistake for Western people to ascribe violent characteristics to religious schools - madrassas. \\nRegarding shutting down all of them - let's shut down Catholic schools in Northern Ireland, who are preaching for killing protestants or American sects who are preaching for American heartland and etc.\\nAgain, my dear Western friends, I would recommend You to look more deeply into matter before simply typing something for gaining points in this Yahoo!

It seems like we've tried everything and nothings working. We've been trying for over 9 months now. I don't think we need to see a fertility doctor because we had no problems conceiving our first child. Any suggestions?\nAnswer: I assume your first pregnancy and birth went just fine, there's nothing that could have happened with your first baby to think there may be problems conceiving another one. \\nI know there is only a one week window each month in which a women can conceive, right after ovulation. Which is why OBGYN's tell you not to get worried until after a year or so of trying. I would recommend your husband wearing boxers (briefs constrict blood flow and keep their testicles too warm causing a lower sperm count). Changing your diet can make a difference too; avoid caffeine, nicotine, and liquor. Try reading Fertility Foods by Jeremy Groll. Over exercise can hinder ovulation in women also.\\nOther than that I would relax, don't worry too much about it, have some fun with the time you have together and all will come in due time.\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

I'm trying to learn all I can topside, so I read quite a bit. \\nI was never taught that the cylinder valve should be turned back 1/4 turn or a short way... in fact, in my confined water dives and the others that I've done since certification, I've never done that; I've just opened the valve.\\nMy b/f says you should turn the valve back a bit, I've read it should be turned back in a tips booklet published by Scuba Diving magazine, yet on the Scuba Diving website, it says that the valve, once opened, should be turned back a bit or NOT AT ALL.\\nWhat is the correct procedure?\\nThanks!\nAnswer: Open it fully (not hard) and back off 1/4 to 1/2 half turn. No more or you may cause turbulence in the 1 st stage (heat it doesn't need) and potentially causing condensation in there. Not a good thing for the reg and definitely bad news if you're diving a normal reg and even an environmental, in freezing conditions. It can also cause a possible a supply issue at depth, when you need it most. Leaving it fully open, could cause the valve to stick, making detaching the 1 st stage a vexing experience to say the least.\\n It is part of the course, you may have just missed it. I've seen Instructors whip through that part mumbling.\\n\\nEdit: I disagree with Don on the fully open part regarding overheads etc. So NOT true nor taught in any wreck course or technical diving course. You ARE taught to know your manifold without the need to think. If indeed you do start to turn it the wrong way, the little it has been shut is an immediate indicator. Also, when it's backed off just that little bit from open full, it has NO impact on supply or smoothness of flow to the 1st stage.\\n\\n Edit: Yup, ask your buddies, they'll agree. As for the fella that answered last...well I guess he's never seen one occur nor read even the OW manual from PADI ( I dug it out, it's in there.). It DOES happen. Just like that outdoor tap that you opened too far and need a wrench to close.\\n Due to the amount of dive related questions that are popping up, this evening during a social at the local pub, I asked a pal of mine that owns a 5 star Padi to join under his shop's name. A number of years ago, this man saved my life on a wreck dive, and he's about to become a PADI Director. That's about as high as you get in that particular org as well as standing in my book. I'm not an instructor ( I got bugged again to do the course tonight for free), hence my reluctance to put the word of \"god\" into some of my answers here. Mine is strictly advice and experience.\\n He can. Hopefully he'll join.\\n If you're curious, his shop's web site is www.coltcreekdiving.com\\n heck, I think there may be a pic or two of me in there too.\n\nAnswer:",

Even the right to vote and change presidents is at risk if chavez is reelected (wich i believe is difficult to happen if elections are fair and clean). If you go to a job interview, they ask you if you dissent the president, as a condition to get the job, causing that only the ignorant and ass kissers get jobs in many public institutions. In Education, The grade system has been eliminated, everybody has the right to pass!!. So students don´t study anymore. They know they will graduate, cause its illegal if any teacher flunk them. In Criminality and National Security, now you usually dont go to jail, if your crime favors the regime: murderers have walked free, cause they killed chavez oposers, and not the people in favor of chavez. Kidnappings numbers have risen over 400%, and there have been 100,000 violent deaths since chavez got to power. (Wich is an enormous number for a small country with a small population). Drug dealers and criminals from other countries walk around Venezuela.. If we talk about economy, Chavez has received more money than aproximately the sum all of the previous governments(8 in 40 years) in the history Venezuelans democracy!!!!!!. Still, he devalued the currency, made illegal to have american $ without selling them to the government. Made illegal for people to travel overseas with more than 4000$, when people returns to Venezuela, they have to sell their money (US$) to the government in exchange for devalued Bolivares. He received aprox. 500,000,000,000 of US$, what means about 1,100,000,000,000,000 Bolivares, and the social plans he talks about so much worth less than 1% of that money. Where is the F*** Money?? He is the richest man on earth now. Bought a jet, that makes the air force one look like trash, has a budget of aprox. 1million US$ for drinks, and another million for Suits.He travels all around the world, almost all year long, with hundreds or thousands of people, in a constant five star all included luxury vacation, and pays for propaganda in dozens of countries. That propaganda has reached some people outside venezuela... inside?? not much. \\n\\nA Free Venezuelan... (Against all odds)\n\nAnswer:",

I send my daughter to a private Christian school. Some people think it's too expensive to send their kids to Christian school, but I tell you it doesn't cost any more than daycare. Most of you probably send your kids to daycare, don't you? Also, you can't put a price on a good Christian education.  They have smaller teacher:student ratios, they focus on academics, they learn good morals, they are allowed to worship as they please (in accordance with the 1st Amendment), they score higher than the national average on tests, and they help to create productive members of society. They are not crime-and-drug ridden like so many public schools. \\nA public school would be the last place I'd send my child if I could help it.\\nIf, however, I did have to send here there, I would be on those teachers, principal and school board like white on rice. I would give them notes saying that they are not to teach my children evolution or any sex education (especially presented by Planned Parenthood!) or any \"diversity\" training (which is really just pro-gay propaganda). I will NOT have my child brainwashed by the public school system. You should be aware that the creation of a free, public school system was one of the tenets of Karl Marx's Humanist Manifesto, which was implemented by Teddy Roosevelt in this country. In fact, most of the tenets of that Manifesto were accomplished in this country in the first half of the 20th century. We have slowly become a socialist nation.\\nBefore that time, children were either home-schooled or private-schooled - and some of the best, most intelligent people our country has ever produced were educated thusly.\n\nAnswer:",

They are grouped together because of the similarities between them. The three most common shared problems involve communication skills, motor skills, and social skills. Since there are no clear diagnostic boundaries separating these conditions it is sometimes difficult to distinguish one from the other for diagnostic purposes.\\n\\nAsperger's syndrome, autistic disorder, and childhood disintegrative disorder are four to five times more common in boys, and Rett's syndrome has been diagnosed primarily in girls.

Thanks!!\nAnswer: Depends on our needs and what you want to accomplish on the website.  MP3.com is a very extensive corporate site with millions of hits per day.  It's unlikely you will require a website with this type of infrastructure.  You can build yourself a free website if you're just starting out at http://geocities.yahoo.com/ or http://www.v3.com/.\\n\\nThere's also plenty of free web templates on sites like macromedia http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/download/templates/\\nor if you like flash you can use http://www.flashloaded.com/templates/freetemplates/\\n\\nThere really is an unlimited amount of resources out there to build your own website for free, especially if you're just starting out.  Database scripts and functionality are not necessary at the beginning so don't get sucked into this type of purchase if you don't need it.  Assess your exact needs first, your audience, your design, and then proceed.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, tell your potential buyers what makes the rocks special and different.  Are they collectibles? rare fossils? Would they be nice to display in their rooms/homes, or around gardens?\n\nAnswer:",

I have to go to hospital next week for a knee replacement in the right side, unyet I spent a week looking after a friends dog, in a high mountain, walking, and enjoying fresh air, since I know what movement I have now, I will have the benifit after my operation. you must not let your muscles fail at an early age, you will be worse as you get older. enjoy life, exercise also gets a control on depresion, which if you are not getting out enough, I would say you are suffering with. you will enlarge most muscles and blood supply, which I am sure you know you need to enlarge****\n\nAnswer:",

This country and its constitution is set up with a system of checks and balances and right now it is out of balance and there are no checks and the Repuglicans are taking advantage of that to set civil and human rights back 50 years.\n\nAnswer:",

So in effect you can never really observe your present thoughts but you can remember the old ones.\nAnswer: This is a very interesting topic. It's like how you can hear yourself say something in your mind, but you don't actually hear sound. Or how you see a certain image when your eyes are open (hence, daydream). It's difficult to observe thoughts as they are happening, since the only way to actually formulate an opinion about what we are thinking is to analyze what we remember thinking. It's pretty amazing how our minds work, and what they control. We can't (more accurately, MOST of us can't) voluntarily control the rate of our heart beat, but we can voluntarily control our breathing. Yet, when we are asleep or not paying attention, our brain's nervous system takes over. It's so amazing...\\n\\nI can go on about this forever! : ) I actually have never heard of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle but I'll look into it. (After a pause...)

A full physical examination is for hearing, sight, wt, ht, b/p, respirations, checking for lumps on the breast, and posssiblyyy a peak at the external genitalia. \\n\\nAre you talking about a full ob-gyn appt? If your friend say a gynocologist, they do commonly perform a Paps smear, which scrapes the wall of the inside of the vagina for tissue cells to examine for Cervical cancer. They do not remove a part of your vagina...unless she really did have some serious cyst...then, she could've undergone some kind of surgical operation for removal.\n\nAnswer:",

I need some examples of either so I can better understand the concepts in real-life or real-world scenarios.\nAnswer: 1.  The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) introduced by von Bertalanffy in 1938 predicts the length of a shark as a function of its age, L = L(t): L(t) = Loo - (Loo - Lo) exp(-kt) \\n2.  Examples of exponential growth\\nBiology. \\nMicroorganisms in a culture dish will grow exponentially, at first, after the first microorganism appears (but then logistically until the available food is exhausted, when growth stops). \\nA virus (SARS, West Nile, smallpox) of sufficient infectivity (k > 0) will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial immunization is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people. \\nHuman population, if the number of births and deaths per person per year were to remain constant (but also see logistic growth). \\nMany responses of living beings to stimuli, including human perception, are logarithmic responses, which are the inverse of exponential responses; the loudness and frequency of sound are perceived logarithmically, even with very faint stimulus, within the limits of perception. This is the reason that exponentially increasing the brightness of visual stimuli is perceived by humans as a smooth (linear) increase, rather than an exponential increase. This has survival value. Generally it is important for the organisms to respond to stimuli in a wide range of levels, from very low levels, to very high levels, while the accuracy of the estimation of differences at high levels of stimulus is much less important for survival. \\nElectroengineering \\nCharging and discharging of capacitors and changes in current in inductors are also exponential growth and decay phenomena. Engineers use a rule of five time constants to estimate when a steady state has been reached. \\nComputer technology \\nProcessing power of computers. See also Moore's law and technological singularity (under exponential growth, there are no such singularities). \\nInternet traffic growth. \\nWikipedia:Modelling Wikipedia's growth - an analysis of Wikipedia's growth rates based on article growth rates and other statistics \\nInvestment. The effect of compound interest over many years has a substantial effect on savings and a person's ability to retire. See also rule of 72 \\nPhysics \\nAtmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with increasing height above sea level, at a rate of about 12% per 1000m. \\nNuclear chain reaction (the concept behind nuclear weapons). Each uranium nucleus that undergoes fission produces multiple neutrons, each of which can be absorbed by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the probability of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a function of the shape and mass of the uranium), k > 0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. \\nNewton's law of cooling  where T is temperature, t is time, and, A, D, and k > 0 are constants, is an example of exponential decay. \\nMulti-level marketing \\nExponential increases appear in each level of a starting member's downline as each subsequent member recruits more people.\n\nAnswer:",
