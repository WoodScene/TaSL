Being a self proclaimed sushi nazi, I was very hesitant about going to sushi roku.  I always have issues with going to chain sushi restaurants.  And I also knew a chef who worked at sushi roku...\\n\\nWhen we walked in the decor was great, with a great view of the strip.  I ordered my usual list of sushi (uni, yellowtail, toro, albacore, hirame) as well as the Chilean sea bass.  My date ordered the Kobe steak.  \\n\\nThe sushi came out first.  We also ordered the special of the night: some special cut of Toro.  The sushi was bland...nothing spectacular.  I could not taste anything special about the Toro.  Very disappointing, considereing we paid $24 for 2 pieces of special Toro.  \\n\\nMy Chilean sea bass was cooked very well, flakey and melts in your mouth.  I didn't particularly like the sauce on my fish.  It was supposed to be a truffle miso glaze, but all i tasted was the pineapples of the glaze.  My date's steak came to us dry and well done when we ordered medium rare.  Already disappointed with our experience, I flagged down a waiter and sent the steak back to the kitchen.  The host and staff were very concern about the steak and immediately sent us a new, better cooked steak.  \\n\\nIf you do plan to go to Sushi Roku, stick to ordering rolls.  For service, Sushi Roku gets 5 stars.  But sigh....service and decor does not keep my belly happy.\n\nAnswer:",

I am currently on hold with COX  - 5 minutes later listening to really bad music on a loop so I decided to share my experience here. I had COX years ago and never had a problem so I decided to go with them when I moved back to the valley. I had several months of \\\"hidden\\\" charges on my bill and was sick of it so I decided to switch. I got a call from Patty in \\\"Outbound Retention\\\" who asked how I would stay. (the fact that that department exists should be a red flag right there) I told her and she got me a lower rate, better service and whole home DVR service...so I stayed. 3 months later. I have had billing problems EVERY month and I am currently on hold trying to keep them from turning my service off because they say I am past due when I am not. Unbelievable. I would switch tomorrow but was told they have to rewire some things in the attic and my walk in closet is the entrance...a lot of hassle. So here I am...on hold. He is getting the job done but I have already spent so much of my own time trying to fix their mistakes. If you are stuck with COX don't hesitate to tell them how unhappy you are, ask for a supervisor, threaten to switch....those things all have seemed to work. (but do it nicely, it seems to have more clout) I am basically going to threaten them if I have ONE more problem with billing I will switch. They really don't want you to go so this seems to be the only way to get your way at this company.\n\nAnswer:",

We are so conflicted about you.  My boyfriend and I dined here on Thanksgiving eve.  We saw the menu ahead of time.  We saw the price.  We were excited about the seafood on the menu, as we're not huge fans of turkey. \\n\\nDuring our meal, we remarked on how different and experimental everything was.  And tasty.  And the portion sizes were...ok.  And everything was... good.  And slightly weird. But tasty.  \\n\\nThe desserts were the only serious disappointment.  My boyfriend described the dessert portions as insulting.  I was disappointed by the serious lack of chocolate.  I love chocolate.  Passion fruit isn't really my thing.  \\n\\nIn the end, we spent $450, which includes tip and two glasses of wine.  And we kind of regret it.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, and so peaceful and quiet.  A wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of The Strip. The service was good.  Efficient but not obtrusive.  We actually had more of a rapport with the food runner, Louis, than anyone else.  Maybe our waiter was upset that we didn't order a $200 bottle of wine.  Whatever.  My boyfriend had a headache, and I wouldn't have finished a bottle on my own.\\n\\nEverything was fine.  But nothing knocked our socks off.  \\n\\nWe love eating out.  I may even go so far as to call us \\\"foodies\\\".  The problem with Twist is, a year from now, I doubt I will be able to recall exactly what we ate.   I probably will be able to describe the decor, but not the food.\\nI'm glad we went.  The view was amazing.  But for $450, the view shouldn't be my favorite part of the evening.\n\nAnswer:",

I had written this place off after the first time, but they sent a flyer out in the mail and I decided to give it another go since I needed to get my car washed and detailed anyway.\\n\\nWhen I got there, they were trying to sell me on a monthly package, and the idea wasn't unappealing since I like to keep my car immaculate. I just remember that during my last wash they had missed so many things on the inside, and was reluctant to commit to them since I had already found another place that did a perfect job.\\n\\nThe guy that I was speaking to asked me what was missed the last time and I went over the long list. He talked to the guys who were currently detailing my car, and by the time I got it back, everything was done just right. So I signed up for the monthly ($35/mo) because I thought it had improved.\\n\\nTwo months later and every time I go, the windows are wiped- but streaky. Whenever I drive at night you can tell and it's so obnoxious. Simple things are missed, like the metal detailing on my steering wheel which always has smudges on it after they turn my car over to me again. The space between the seats isn't vacuumed. My sunroof always looks awful. I'm going to cancel the monthly and return to my other detailing guys at Tivoli Village (have your car detailed while you're having lunch).\\n\\nTheir hours aren't correct as they close at 4:30 I believe.

My family decided to stay at Circus Circus so it would be convenient for my 12 year old brother to go play the games there. The check in process was delayed because the incompetent staff was having trouble issuing our keycards so we had to wait for 20 min. After checking in we go drop off our bags and hit the buffet. The buffet was overpriced and disappointing with very little variety and extremely poor quality. During my stay I had some of my stuff stolen out of my room.\\nI am positive it was an employee who spotted me in the lobby carrying an incase bag. They probably waited until we left the room after dropping off our luggage to steal some of my stuff. My family left the room for about an hour to go eat dinner and after coming back i notice my laptop bag was gone containing a macbook pro, 2 ipods, and an electric razor.\\n\\nHonestly if you're vacationing to Vegas, live a little and book a nice hotel.

They then provided a voucher for Fox, which seemed okay at the time.  However, in addition experiencing a long check-in over 30 minutes due to a ill-trained employee and understaffing, I got another nasty surprise.  Fox claims that renters must produce on-demand proof of drivers insurance to law enforcement should they be pulled over.  They highly recommend purchasing additional liability insurance.  I've now read that this is unscrupulous, and the CA attorney general has filed suit against Fox there.  After really feeling I was being shafted, and worrying about what type of road service I would get off in the desert of AZ, I returned the Fox car and went over to my trusted friends at AVIS.  Plus, the price was less after removing all the insurance and extra driver fees!\\n\\nDon't be foolish and try to skimp here.  Go with a reputable company.  Sure, some of the employees are nice individually, but they work for a shifty organization.\n\nAnswer:",

It looked busy outside on the patio so I figured this must be a pretty decent pizza place. I have only been to one other Fox restaurant and that is True Food Kitchen, which I like a lot. This place..... meh.\\n\\nWe walk in, and the first thing I notice to be different is its not a sit down, order, and food is brought to you kind of place. Its a order at the register, wait for food to come out kind of place. Which I was not expecting and frankly it confused me. The prices were extremely high for this kind of establishment. We ordered a few different items. The portabello and artichoke bruschetta, $4.50. Was it worth the money? No way. It was one thick slice of bread spread with a thin layer of goat cheese, topped with a minuscule amount of peppers, artichokes, and hardly any mushrooms. It did taste good, but definitely not a good value for the money. We also ordered the portabello and artichoke pizza $9.75, as well as the mushroom and arugula pizza, $9.75. I don't know where this place gets off charging the amount of money they do for how little food they give you. Their pizzas are a thin crust, with a thin layer of sauce, and a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Do people actually come here on a regular basis and pay this much for such a thin pizza? If they do something must be wrong with them. Either that or they are so dazzled by the Fox name that they don't care where they throw their cash. Now don't get me wrong. The pizzas all tasted really good, but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here, which is the only reason for the two star review. I don't just review taste, I also review value. And the value here for what you get is none. \\n\\nAlso, places like this that don't pay their employees at least minimum wage really bother me. At the register you pay and they have a tip line. I don't usually tip at these kinds of places where all the service I get is food being brought out to me or if I do I don't tip the usual amount, but I was so flustered by this I had no idea what to do. I even asked the girl do people usually tip, and she told me they were tip based pay employees. Seriously? They don't do anything worth the tip. At that point I felt obligated to tip so I did. And I still feel like I shouldn't have. All in all I spent $34 dollars on about $5 worth of ingredients. I wont be back.\n\nAnswer:",

This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. I come here a lot. It just has everything in one place. It's far enough from the sometimes overwhelming buzz of the strip, but has a full bar in case you still want to catch a buzz of your own. They have friendly servers, dope atmosphere and cool decor but what really does it is the food. Man I can eat here every day. \\n\\nThey have traditional vietnamese dishes, like pho and BBH. All pretty good, and being that I come from living in LA and OC the land of vietnamese food I can say it's comparable to some of the better spots out there. As far as Vegas goes it's one of my favorite spots for pho. The quality of the meat in particular when you order it raw is better than most out here. And the oxtail pho, man. Oxtail everything is good and they have good oxtail. But what really kills the game is their specials. Where else can you get lobster pho? Nowhere. At least not till they brought it. They always have fresh seafood specials like oysters, crab, and crawfish. I've eaten basically everything. I could keep going on and on but better to let you try it for yourself. Here's a few recommendations tho. \\nLobster garlic noodle. Their version of it is so bomb. \\nBlack pepper lobster. I'm a fan of black pepper already but with lobster?????\\nBeef carpaccio. My go to appetizer. \\nOxtail fries. Because damn. Oxtail. And fries, but if you don't feel like french fries then try my all time favorite dish here...\\nOXTAIL LOCO MOCO. \\nAdd an extra egg, just because you got it like that.

I am not complaining because I want anything free or I am trying to down your casino/buffet.  You have a wonderful casino, from gambling options to hotel, to awesome guest relations but your buffet needs improvement, a lot!\\n\\nWhen I came into Vegas all I have been seeing on advertisement is how good your buffet is.  I don't have a really high standard for buffets but when I visited Wicked Spoon last year at the Cosmo, the bar went through the roof.  I never try to compare buffets but when one hits the fan such as your I want to notify your establishment.  I always wanted to check out Aria's buffet because how you acclaim that it is amazing, so I decided to give it a try.\\n\\nTo start me off, how you list your food options on the chalkboard is definitely creative but hard to digest.  Digest being the board sometimes is in the middle of the option food bar and trying to distinguish which item is which becomes a little tough especially when there is a line of people behind you and you don't want to hold them up.\\n\\nThe choices were not neaten and seemed a little trashy like a Home Buffet.  The food at best was par and the lady cutting the prime rib told me my piece of meat was med/rare when clearly it was medwell+.  I wasn't going to argue with her because there was a line behind me and I am easy going but that is the first time I didn't finish a piece of A1-Prime rib.  It was dry and not appealing.\\n\\nYour Asian selection was definitely below par.  Half the food didn't taste fresh and the steam pork bun was super dry.\\n\\nThe only plus side was your seafood selection.  I mean it is hard to mess up cold seafood but it was the only and the best part of dinner.\\n\\nThe worst part of about the experience was the server Victoria.  She seems like a nice lady but if she was doing full service she would crash.  I don't know if she was overwhelmed or was behind but it is not that hard to grab a spoon or listen to a specific drink request which she both botched. My guest and I asked her for a spoon two separate times and she did not return with one.  She didn't get the drink request right and she barely came by to clear done items off the table.  I still left her a good tip because it was a free buffet but that left a sour taste in my mouth.  I served before and it is almost an insult that she fails at a buffet which is the easiest serving job in a world.\\n\\nIf someone was to ask me to recommend a buffet to them in Las Vegas I would not say yours until it improves.\\n\\ndp\n\nAnswer:",

I had heard of Rick Moonen the night before going to his restaurant from a Top Chef fan.  She was a big Rick Moonen fan.  Little did I know then, so is Rick Moonen.\\n\\nFor being a fresh seafood restaurant located in a smoke filled Vegas casino, it doesn't feel like a fresh seafood restaurant located in a smoke filled Vegas casino.  That was nice.  Thanks Rick Moonen.  \\n\\nI ordered off of the prix fixe menu (55$) and went with the Rick Moonen Style \\\"Cioppino\\\" as the main course.\\n\\nMy date ordered the Ebi-Go Roll.  She was not too impressed.  Thinking that her hopes were high because she was a big Rick Moonen fan, I tried her sushi and was also not pleased.  It looked spicy as described on the menu but didn't have much of a kick.  She should have ordered something that said Rick Moonen in front of it because the Cioppino was excellent and recommended as a fan of seafood.  We tried the Ahi Tuna Duo for an appetizer that was so-so and the Key Lime pie for desert which was meh (both off the prix fixe menu).  Probably wouldn't go for those a second time.\\n\\nThe venue is great, set back slightly from the Mandalay Bay casino floor just to give you enough of a reminder that you are still in Vegas.  We ate downstairs which is perfect for a casual date and not too loud. Rick Moonen apparently knows seafood and the accolades donning every inch of the walls suggest that Rick Moonen is fully aware that he knows seafood.  But for a first visit the food seemed to be hit or miss.  I recommend something that says Rick Moonen in front of it which by my count were about 13 items.  Or just get the mac and cheese, you can't really mess that up.\n\nAnswer:",

Should be called GREAT food!!  I am SO excited I finally made it to this household-named restaurant!  I have been desperate to check them out but my husband isn't one for tapas so we never made it a priority.  This past Friday I was able to enjoy my tapas in peace because I dined with three other ladies that were more than willing to try everything!  It was perfect!!  We arrived on Friday around 7:30 and were seated within about 30 minutes, which isn't bad considering they don't take reservations.\\n\\nThe waitress was super helpful in guiding us through the menu and gave us some suggestions.  Some of the plates are really best for 2 people and others were enough for the 4 of us to share.  We tried so many different things I don't even know where to start.  I will just break it down dish by dish:\\n\\nBroccoli Raab--Very good, refreshing, flavored well, served chilled, not too bitter\\nArugala--Strawberries, pine nuts, and goat cheese...can you even go wrong?\\nCheese plate--Meh.  I mean blue cheese made an appearance, really?  Come on.\\nFalafel--Scrumptious...4 little falafel nuggets.  Left me panting for more..so good.\\nRisotto--Not sure what flavors were combined to make this yummy goodness but it was on point\\n\\nGnocchi--With RABBIT.  Yup, I ate rabbit.  First time ever folks.  The gnocchi was excellent.  The rabbit was tender and flavorful.  It was not doubt gamey but blended well with the other flavors.  It was a table favorite.\\n\\nSteamed Bun--This one has the most hype around it but it wasn't necessarily our favorite.  The pork was so tough and the flavors were ok but it wasn't THAT great.\\n\\nMussels--My first time trying Mussels!  I don't have anything to compare these to but the others were loving these mussels.  They were in a green curry sauce and they were served with soft, warm, naan.  We all started dipping the bread in the sauce afterwards...and we even ordered more naan.  It was very good!!\\n\\nPork tenderloin--Another group favorite..so tender, full of flavor, served with a soft piece of cornbread.  Very good!!\\n\\nWe wrapped up our pigfest by grubbing down a brownie served with biscoff icecream.  The brownie was warm with chocolate chips...it was thin, not very moist, just okay in my opinion.  The icecream was very creamy.  We licked the plate, don't let me fool you.\\n\\nOverall--great experience.  Atmosphere is loud and crowded but energizing.  I love the hustle in this place.  People are eating well and are satisfied!  Prices are a little high but the quality of food makes it worth it.  I'll be back no doubt!\n\nAnswer:",

Words hardly exist to describe our experience at this place.\\n\\nThis was the third place on the list for our limo to take our bachelorette party, because I'd heard that it was only to be visited while trashed. Also, they had a mechanical bull. Additional bonus: I was told we were likely to be the hottest people in the place. \\n\\nHow could this go wrong? Well, being the hottest group in a place is simply not all it's cracked up to be. Other reviewers mention being completely freaked out by everyone around them - this is entirely true, and a diplomatic way of saying that beer goggles cast no positive light on the ugly mugs surrounding you.\\n\\nI'm all about the common person getting their party on. But the common folks as a group usually include some average people, some below-average, and some above-average. The crowd at this place made it seem like there were bouncers at the door who kept out anyone who looked average or better.\\n\\nOur group came in costume - 80's clothes from the Prince era - and when we might've looked like a hot mess at other places, we somehow didn't stick out at all in this joint. \\n\\nCreepy men - ones old enough to be my dad - asked me to dance and actually proposed to me on the dance floor. One guy with such heavy vodka breath practically spit all over me on the dance floor and incorporated a move I've never experienced before - he grabbed my glowstick necklace with his teeth and shook it around like a dog with a bone.\\n\\nThe \\\"normal\\\" people were kind of like folks you'd see at a work function or company picnic - in khaki pants with pleats down the front and tucked-in polo shirts and cell phone holsters on their belts.\\n\\nThe 80's room dance floor is shaped like a circle and has 2 cages. When they're populated, they're usually up to some silly over-the-top 80's or 70's dance moves. It is really fun when some strange people are totally into it and have the \\\"up with people\\\" vibe with such enthusiasm. Think of a dance floor full of girls like the \\\"Flight of the Conchords\\\" biggest fan.\\n\\nIt's about as harmless as a gay bar in there, except that's where I was proposed to, so you do have to have a sense of humor. The wierdest part is the 50 year-olds, with very bad fashion sense, booty-dancing with each other. There was also a man who looked to be about sixty who was spastically running in place in a cowboy hat and tennis shoes while his face went through epileptic siezures. Many folks like this were there - people who decided they would be \\\"hip\\\" by wearing John Lennon sunglasses with reflective lenses or something. If you stand too close, one of them will fixate on you and begin dancing in your direction.\\n\\nThe hip-hop room is a rectangular room with four cages on each corner. An orgy was occurring in one of the cages. Three girls who looked like they were from Scottsdale (somewhat thin, in designer jeans and holding Gucci bags) decided to go ASAP - As Slutty As Possible - and grind on each other in the cage. This was going as you'd pretty much expect, until it took a turn for the worse.\\n\\nA tall white-trashy looking girl, who looked like a very cheap stripper, was hanging out below the cage. She had long wavy, frizzy blond hair and glasses, and was wearing an uber-short pleated skirt and black tank that showed her midriff, and a thong. She decided to reach her arm into the cage and started rubbing one of the girls' crotches over her jeans from behind, before she decided to jump into the cage.\\n\\nShe jumped in the cage and began VERY aggressively grinding/bucking on the girls - because she was so much taller than them, they were easily pushed around. I watched one of the Scottsdale girls talking to her friend about \\\"How to get out of this\\\" while she was being essentially banged from behind by the stripper chick. They were knocking into each other, stumbling like dominoes in the cage.\\n\\nAt some point, the Scottsdale girls reluctantly and slowly caved in until the stripper chick threw one girl's back up against the wall and started jackhammering her like a dog on a leg. By now, the cage was surrounded by guys who could no longer keep it together, and hands started reaching through the cage and grabbing anything they could grab.\\n\\nThis scene continued on for about 20 minutes and escalated until a large body builder guy with a shaved head jumped in and took off his shirt and sandwiched himself between them all. He had a large asian-font tattoo across his back that said \\\"JESUS.\\\"\\n\\nSecurity showed up to break it up ... only because the guy had taken off his shirt.\\n\\nMy friends were propositioned by dad-aged men, some of whom would invite them home by standing behind them and staring, wordlessly touching their arm repeatedly until the bar closed. Since it seemed so normal, it made me wonder if it's also normal there for a girl to respond by jumping in the stranger's car after the last song.\\n\\nIt was more like an anthropological experiment than a normal night out on the town.

I never have high expectations for a restaurant in an area with few alternate dining options.  No complaints about the service.  Our server was very pleasant.  \\n\\nWe started with the FIlet Tips as an appetizer.  As you'd expect with filet, the meat was tender.  The meat wasn't really hot nor did it boast a lot of flavor, but the port wine sauce and the creamy horseradish helped fill that void.  All in all, not a bad dish, although it could benefit from a bit more creative plating as it was just a lot of meat on a white plate.  \\n\\nI played it safe and ordered the BBQ Kobe burger.  Though the meat was slightly undercooked, it was juicy and tender.  However, the bacon had a beef-jerky-like texture, as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp since breakfast.  It was tough to chew, so I removed all the bacon from the burger.  The fries tasted like they had been frozen, just lacking anything resembling freshness.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the Chicken Angelo.  This wasn't a bad dish, but it wasn't great either.  The chicken was fine, but like the burger, I question the freshness of some of the ingredients used in the dish.\\n\\nAll in all, the meal wasn't horrible, but it definitely did not live up to it's name.

However a recent visit to try their lunch buffet was a different story. The first thing that stuck out was the cheap plastic plates, disposable plastic eating utensils, and styrofoam/plastic cups for water and soups/sauces. I have been to many Indian lunch buffets, but this was the first time I've seen such cheap dining ware being used. While they had several vegetarian offerings, they only had a couple of mediocre meat dishes: chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken. There was a huge tray of naan which looked overly doughy and dried out so I didn't even bother trying it. The subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit. The halwa dessert was extremely dry and just gross. My friend and I commented that the only thing at the buffet that they seemed to do pretty well was the basmati rice.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, I was in for another shock. $12.95 for an Indian lunch buffet?!? That has got to make this the priciest one in town since most are in the range of $9.99 to $10.99. Now if this buffet was one of the best, I probably wouldn't mind paying a premium price. Come to think of it, if they lowered the price to $8.95, it still wouldn't be worth it. There are just too many better places in town, i.e. Taj Palace or Mt Everest., to waste your appetite on this one.\n\nAnswer:",

Every time we come to OH, I say I'm going to eat something different, but alas, it never happens. There are three OH, one down the street from the other. The original is the one we've gone to the most, but the new location has mimosas and beer. Simple things my friends, simple things, especially in the morning after a very, very long night.\\n\\nThe lobster omelet is phenomenal. Real lobster, avocado and Jack cheese. I am particular about my omelets and how they're constructed (yes, omelet snobbery exists), and OH puts a ton of lobster, avocado and cheese stuffed into the omelet instead of sitting on top of the omelet doing nothing. I strongly dislike lazy omelet makers that put main ingredients (other than chili, chile verde, etc)on top of the omelet only instead of inside the omelet, so OH does everything right. There is nothing like cutting into the baby Lobster Fest omelet (which is still massively large)and getting a supple chunk of lobster, cheese and avocado in every bite. The homemade chips that come with the omelet have a great seasoning on them that makes it easy to devour them in one foul swoop. \\n\\nMy fiance has tried several different dishes. So far, his favorite dish is the lobster eggs benedict. I don't know how they make their hollandaise sauce, and I don't know if I want to. There are some high caloric foods that I don't need to think about when licking the plate. Picture a beautiful piece of lobster resting under a perfectly poached egg drowned in hollandaise sauce. Somewhere on the plate is an english muffin, but that's not as important as what's rocking out on top of the muffin. Some people don't want their EB drowned in hollandaise, so if that's you, ask for it on the side. I may or may not have dipped some of my chips in said hollandaise sauce just to ensure my arteries were clogged before working out later that day.\\n\\nAdvice: Get the baby omelet. They say it is a baby size, but the baby size is large enough still for an ogre baby, because its still hefty and fills up 75% of the people who eat it. If you're getting an omelet topped with chili or chile verde (which is pretty delicious, but doesn't have enough kick like I'm used to with chile verde), definitely go for the smaller size or you'll be hurting in the restroom for many hours following your meal. Come on. That many eggs can rarely do a body good. Also, get the banana bread. Oh dear God. Piping hot homemade banana bread smothered in real butter (margarine is a crime against the world)not only has one of the most intoxicating smells, but according to my fiance the taste of it is fantastic.\n\nAnswer:",

Seared Ahi is great, but seared whitefish?  I don't think so.  The Pinot Grigio was barely chilled.  The waiter poured almost full glasses so he wouldn't have to fill them again, I guess, then plopped the warm bottle on the table so it would get even warmer.

This place is an absolute shit hole with the worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life. I would not stay here again even if they paid me to. \\n\\nI looked on Yelp before I made the reservation here. Since most of the complaints and bad ratings seemed due to the construction at the time, I called the front desk to make sure that construction would be completed by the time of our arrival. I woke up to the sound of construction this morning. I work in construction so usually things like that don't bother me too much, it is just one of those things that has to be done. However, I am not talking about some guys hanging from scaffolding and banging hammers. I am talking about heavy equipment and large peices of metal being banged around first thing in the morning.  I'm really not sure what they're doing out there, but from the sound of it I would guess that they are errecting an actual sized replica of the statue of liberty. \\n\\nWhen we first arrived and could finally check into our room, completely exhausted after traveling way too early in the morning, we were absolutely disgusted. Not only are the pictures online taken at angles that make them seem a LOT larger than their actual size, but our room was dirty. The carpet had not been vacuumed, there was hair on the bathroom floor, stains on the pillowcases, and some absolutely disgusting I-don't-want-to-know-what on the side of the bed frame. \\nWhen I called down to the front desk to inform them of our problems, the woman who answered spent 10 minutes arguing with me before she sent up the housekeeping manager. I was informed that the person who told me that construction would be finished had been wrong and maybe I had called the wrong number because NO ONE there would have EVER said that. Then I was informed that these rooms were just gutted and remodeled, so there was NO WAY that there were stains on any of the pillowcases or that the room was as dirty as I said, but she would send the housekeeping manager up to check. Apparently the motto \\\"The customer is always right\\\" has been replaced here by \\\"Blame it all on the customer\\\". \\n\\nAfter the housekeeping manager came up, saw the room and fed us some story about a trainee cleaning it, we were offered a different room. Not a nicer room for all of our trouble, just a different room. With a worse view. The manager comped our \\\"resort fee\\\" for the three day stay (amounting to a whopping $70 savings). (I'm not entirely sure what the resort fee is for in the first place, since half of the amenities listed on their website seem to not exist.) At this point we asked if we could just get a refund and go to another hotel, or even just to transfer to another property owned by the same company. Apparently since we booked through Travelocity, that was not an option. We called them, they were rude and less helpful than the hotel, but I'll save that for another review. \\n\\nSo now here we are. Being held hostage in one of the crappiest hotel rooms I have ever had the displeasure of staying in, because no one can seem to figure out how to give us a refund, or an upgrade, or a transfer.  The room is about the size of a shoebox, with no windows that open to the outside. I'm not usually claustrophobic,  but I pretty much want to crawl out of my skin while laying here and I have a stuffy nose from the lack of fresh air. There is absolutely no insulation in the walls. I just listened to my neighbor pee. Also got to listen to him having sex last night. I feel like maybe I have to buy him a drink now or something. The \\\"remodel\\\" that they spoke of was a piss poor attempt at a lackluster cosmetic makeover and the bed is about as comfortable as passing out on a stack of newspapers. And there is no coffee maker. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE HUNGOVER PEOPLE WITHOUT COFFEE IN THE MORNING?????? \\n\\nI could continue,  but if you have read this far and still have any desire to stay here, then you are just dumb enough to deserve to stay here.\\n\\nPS- The neighbor just peed again. I have to know that, so now you do too. I'm really hoping to be dressed and gone before he has to poop.\n\nAnswer:",

In Naming Our Own Price and Saving (priceline, duh), we were able to secure a room at the Luxor for $39 -- especially nice since Leo doesn't believe in paying for rooms in LV. \\n\\nWe arrived and got a room in the pyramid, which is a nice novelty to say we've done. But the room is definitely outdated.

Now, however, the hieroglyphics on the closet don't make up for what the room lacks. Typical LV hotel essentials -- a safe and a luggage -- were missing. \\n\\nBut the room did come with something extra-special. The PLU sticker from a mango was found on the bathroom floor.

With the exception of telling us where to sit, photographer offered no direction.  Entire photo shoot lasted appx 10 to 15 minutes. While looking at the extremely disappointing images, the photographer left us no less than 3 times to take a personal call on his cell phone. Although a backdrop was used, in many of the photograph the studio itself was exposed. In other words the backdrop did not cover the entire backgrounds. Many of the photos had at least one member of our party cut off! Eventually we did settle on a package provided some editing and photoshopping be done. We were told it would take 15 minutes before our photos were ready. We came back an hour later and they still weren't ready. When we did finally receive our photos not one single edit or Photoshop process had been done! Clearly no quality control was done. 1 photo in particular that I ordered a 10 by 13, as well as several 8 by 10 of was clock so poorly bet the four year old in the picture had three quarters of her head removed and I had everything from my lower lip down cropped out . So you could only see the for your old one eyeball, and it looks like I was biting the bottom of the picture! When I returned I was disgusted. As I said none of this photo editing had been done at all. When the photographer attempted to fix his errors, he did it on photos that we did not order. There were so many issues it's impossible to relay them all on here. I spent over $200 on unusable photographs. I ended up returning everything. And now have to wait 5 to 6 weeks for a refund! Do yourself a favor... You go to Groupon and find a real photography studio. Because this place has proven the old adage you get what you pay for! And here, you get crappy customer service and very poor quality photos.\n\nAnswer:",

Food came out pretty quickly but we were the only ones ordering when we got there. The salmon pieces were big, but not the freshest tasting - and the seaweed salad was just average. Gyoza was mostly cabbage (more like an egg roll) and came with a cilantro dipping sauce that was thick and weird but if you like cilantro you might like it.

We were so happy after that first visit that we returned and took along another couple - who may be moving to our fair city - to introduce them to life as locals.  Our experience was less than stellar.  But I didn't update my review then.  On the second visit, I ordered the same salmon dish I had the first time, and it was so bad I had to send it back.  The waitress tried to explain that they use frozen salmon, and yada, yada.  Its replacement was just ordinary.  The other couple were split 50-50 in their opinions of their dishes.\\n\\nDuring our first visit we wanted to get more information about take-out, figuring that we'd be doing that on a regular basis.  We particularly wanted to know about the soup.  Our Tom Kha was fabulous, and it was such a big bowl that we couldn't imagine we'd get that much if we had it as take-out, but the waitress assured us it was a very big container.\\n\\nSo on this uncharacteristically rainy night, we opted for take-out from Noodle House.  My first disappointment was taking an ordinary Chinese restaurant-type plastic container out of the bag that was only three-quarters full.  It turned out not to matter:  the soup was so unbearably spicy that we couldn't finish it.  It also had half the amount of chicken that our dine-in portion had.  \\n\\nFour vegetable spring rolls were decent, but very greasy.  \\n\\nWe ordered our main dish, Pad Thai, as a chicken-beef-shrimp combination.  It had a \\\"generous\\\" helping of two rather small shrimp, chewy and flavorless beef, and some tender chicken.  This dish is usually very bland at other Thai restaurants, but this one was very spicy.  I didn't mind that, since it didn't cause smoke to come out of my ears like the soup did.  But the noodles were rubbery, and if it had chopped peanuts, there weren't enough to taste them.  A disappointment.\\n\\nI guess it was too good to be true, but we'll go back to the other Thai restaurants we used to go to before our hopes were raised by the opening of Thai-Style Noodle House, which is so much closer to our home.

The service was very friendly, but not very able.  We were starving so quickly ordered salads and bread.  They said they would bring out the bread first, the bread, the bread, Bueller, Bueller, anyone?  It did not go down hill from here, nor did it get better, it was just consistently mediocre.  So they bring our the salad and we are still waiting for the bread and they come around to give us steak knives, then they walk around the table two times and then walk away without leaving us the knives.  We finish the salads, right as they bring out the bread.  They take away our plates, and we wait for the steaks.  We ordered a Ribeye, a Porterhouse and a filet.  The steaks come out, with no sides.  Oh, remember that question about steak knives and if the waiter should place them on the table...not only do we not have steak knives we have no flatware, the flatware left with the dirty salad plates, just as they should have, but was not replaced until we asked for it, well after the steaks arrived.  Oh, and the sides.... they eventually showed up.  So let's talk about the food.  My ribeye had fantastic flavor, though a little over done - I ordered medium rare and it turned up medium, and I was enjoying it for the first half, until I got closer to the bone when what was medium turned into medium well.  Now, please understand that steaks continue to cook after you remove them from heat, so if I would have been able to eat the steak when it came out, perhaps it would have been okay, but remember earlier when I said we had steaks but no flatware, that may have made all the difference in how done the steak was.  So, I just left the second half uneaten, paid our bill and left.  $200 bill for three steaks, salads and sides, but no alcohol.  One of the worst dining experiences I have had at that price point - ever, it was just skating on the edge the whole way, never bad enough to really complain, but just bad enough to make it not an enjoyable meal.\\n\\nNo reason it had to turn out this way, I hope management reads this and addresses the issues.\n\nAnswer:",

Not to mention, the service was spectacular on both visits. \\n\\nOur group of 10 dined at Hash House twice for breakfast while in Vegas over Christmas. Staying at the Flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the Imperial Palace and up the escalator dedicated to Hash House. Getting to the restaurant before 9AM both times, the staff was easily able to accommodate our large group. The restaurant was largely empty that early, but did begin to fill up around 10AM. Our servers, on both occasions, were courteous, efficient, enthusiastic, and even charming. For me, that can really put a dining experience over the top. \\n\\nWhile the food was VERY good, being The Griddle cafe fanatic that I am, I cannot give Hash House 5 stars. Their pancakes (snickers) and french toast did not compare to the deliciousness that is The Griddle. \\n\\nBUT, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles is note worthy. Perfectly Fried Chicken breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best fried chicken I recall having (although I rarely eat fried chicken). The waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. This was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. The maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really highlighted the dish and I recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. \\nIt was just YUM! My boyfriend and I split the dish and it was perfect for two people. The next visit we split the french toast which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread. The banana was disturbing at first being black from the griddle, but was actually delicious and perfectly cooked. It went well with the french toast. \\n\\nMany people at our table went with the Tractor Special, which was well received and the most traditional style breakfast item they offer. No one tried their hash, sadly. \\n\\nAny meal on the menu, if you can split it with someone, DO IT! Our server was nice enough not to charge to $2.50 split plate charge. \\n\\nI do think that Hash House is a \\\"Must-Go\\\" while in Vegas. But, sorry, HH, you're not The BEST. xoxo\n\nAnswer:",

My boyfriend and\\nI made a lunch reservation to celebrate his promotion at work. We arrived and noticed the reservation wasn't necessary in the less than half full restaurant. Still, we were seated in a terrible table situated next to the kitchen doors and a server station and next to a large party. Not the quiet romantic lunch we had hoped for. It was all downhill from there. Our server was pushy and unattentive. Whenever myself or my boyfriend would order any item (and we ordered a lot-cocktails, appetizer,\\n2 entrees and dessert) our server would suggest a more expensive item and act agitated when we politely refused. At one point she simply refused to leave the table until we ordered the dessert she suggested even though we explained that we would really prefer to order our favorite. It was ridiculous! I understand that part of a servers job is to upsell but it was taken way too far this time.

I asked for a refill of my soda when the entrees were served but didnt receive it until after we got our bill and I had to ask several times.

I appreciated her getting back to me so quickly and her willingness to fit me into their schedule. That was about the extent of any positive experience I had with them.\\n\\nI was given an arrival time of 2-3 pm. At 3, the owner contacted me saying the girls were running about half an hour late...no big deal. At 4:15, no one had come yet. I was then called by the crew saying they had run out of gas and would have to reschedule. I said that would not be possible because the reason I needed the cleaning done that day was because we were moving in the following day. They said they would try to get on the road and figure something out. At 6 pm they finally arrived. The girls were very sweet but on top of everything that had happened, I was expecting a thorough cleaning. They did a great job on the bathrooms but I felt everything else was either brushed over or not noticed at all. One reason we needed cleaning was because the previous tenants had a dog with very long hair. At the end of our cleaning, there was still hair and dirt on the \\\"mopped\\\" kitchen floor, the inside of the fridge, freezer and cabinets had not been touched. I don't know if my experience was a fluke but it added a lot of anxiety to an already stressful week. My husband and I have spent the last three days cleaning what should have already been a clean townhouse. I still ended up paying what I would have if the correct appointment time had been kept and at the end of all of it, I received an e-mail saying if I did a Yelp review I would receive $20 off my next appointment. So here I am, writing my review. Although I do not anticipate using my discount because I will not be using this company again.\n\nAnswer:",

I stumbled in the front with my friend and tried to get a free shot because they were giving out free shots during the weekend. Security came up to us and said we couldn't have them.

I flipped him the bird and came back down 10 minutes later with a bottle of Jack and he still followed us out of the casino. \\n\\nWe got a smoking room. One of the people who stayed in the room didn't want us smoking in there so we smoked near the ice machine. Security kicked us out of there too.

In fact, the guy who checked us in was very friendly and actually upgraded our room . However, I was with a large group of ladies attending a conference, so we had several different rooms and everyone checking in separately . One member of our party was the last to arrive and was given a smoking room when she asked for a non smoking room . She went back down to talk to the people in the front desk and they told her that it was \\\" too bad\\\" and a non smoking room was not guaranteed . She explained how she could not be in a smoking room because of her eyes, nose , throat etc. and asked to speak to a manager . The guy replies \\\" there's no one here higher than me .\\\" Needless to say, after over an hour of arguing, they did finally move her . All our party was on the 5th floor with spacious rooms and a spa tub . She was given a tiny room in a completely separate tower on the 59th floor with only a shower- no spa tub . Also, upon arrival she noticed the phone in the room did not work - nice way to avoid a complaint to the front desk huh ?!\\n\\nUnfortunately, it doesn't end there . We attended the last day of our conference , which was IN Caesars and ended at 12. We all asked for a late check out . Everything went smoothly for everyone -except our person in floor 59! She went up to the separate tower to floor 59 to find that they had reset her key. She had to go all the way back down to the front desk and have them reissue a room key ! \\n\\nIt's such a sad day when a place whose whole existence is due to customer service and they can treat people so horribly !\n\nAnswer:",

Their shuttle buses are clean and well air-conditioned. Our driver from the airport was very friendly, and got everyone to their respective hotels very quickly and safely. \\n\\nThat's where the positives end. \\n\\nI wish our trip from our hotel back to the airport was as pleasant as the first. Alas, it was not. Our driver arrived on time (about the only positive), but once we were on our way, I thought we might not make it to the airport! He weaved in and out of traffic recklessly, jostling the 5 passengers in the bus worse than a wooden rollercoaster! He nearly clipped a stopped car as we entered the drive for another hotel so he could see if anyone was at the stop (they weren't - he sped away, over speed bumps and all!). When we finally arrived at the airport, he got our luggage out from the back. Two other passengers got their bags and were on their way. I was the first of our party of three to get my bag. I thanked the driver and began walking away. As the second person in our party got his bags, the driver began saying very rude things and even called us names!! I was appalled! The third and final member of our group retrieved his bags after this nonsense, and I can tell you the driver did NOT receive a tip as he so bluntly was looking for one. Try not to insult your customers before they're off the bus. \\n\\nSo, certainly, go with Executive if you A.) have a hankering to be insulted by the man providing the service for which you have paid, or B.) have your wallet out and ready, waving dollar bills in the driver's face so that he will not treat you thus.\n\nAnswer:",

But the food here is good and they accomodated a special request, so for that Copper gets high marks.  \\n\\nThe SAMOSAs are as expected.  Potato and pea wrapped in a nice fried crunchy dough. The chutneys are tasty.  Nothing out of the ordinary or that you couldn't get anywhere else (or make at home).\\n\\nCHICKEN CHETTINADU is not for the faint of heart (or palette).  My colleague was warned that the base was spicy, but she scoffed and said she loved spicy food.  Fast forward 20 minutes and there was sweat dripping from her forehead and her eyes and nose were watering.  I tasted the gravy, and thought it was great, but I didn't try to eat a bowl full of it.  \\n\\nAll entrees are served family style, with rice added to the table.  We also got a bit of naan free but ordered extra with the meal.  No salt or pepper on the table, but they're happy to bring it if you ask.\\n\\nThe ZESTY VEGETABLE BHAJI side was interesting.  Long julienned pieces of mixed vegetables, including beets, all mixed with a dry spice rub.  \\n\\nThe traditional vegetarian menu offers PANEER MAKHAWALA, which is a red gravy similar to tikka masala or butter gravy.  Very rich and flavorful but not too spicy. I asked to substitue cauliflower / gobi for the paneer, and the chef nicely complied.  Overall this was a very tasty and well balanced dish.  \\n\\nThe service was great, and the interior of the restaurant (located in a very old rehabbed house) is unique.  \\n\\nFor people looking for more Indian options, try the University area.  It's full of great Indian hole-in-the-walls.  My personal faves: Persis (everything is good, but the Gobi 65 is amazing), Tulips (varied weekend buffet and good a la carte ordering) and Passage to India (great gobi manchurian and weekend/lunch buffet).\n\nAnswer:",

At half price we definitely enjoyed the meal, but at $43 bucks regular price you could spend an additional $5 dollars and take advantage of the pre-fixe menu at any number of great dining options along the strip. Surprisingly, for being a Brazilian Steakhouse the steak was the disappointing part of the meal. The filet was way overcooked and the sirloin, while perfectly medium rare was also perfectly bland. The other items we sampled included the ham, bacon wrapped turkey, sausage and pork loin were all very tasty. Salad bar was solid with a variety of items to choose from. Only salad bar item that was off was the antipasto salad. We would return with half price tickets in the future.\n\nAnswer:",

No clue, I'm talking about the lounge/club.\\n\\nFirst, it wasn't very busy when we went on a Friday night, and the people who were there looked like they were not having any fun either. They probably got recruited by the various Mandalay Bay properties like the restaurants that promise you free cover if you bring the receipt, or the solicitors on the main floor handing out cards also offering free cover. Well no shit there's free cover, there isn't anybody inside! One of the staff approached us and offered us bottle service for a deal (forget the price) so we accepted, why the hell not it was cheaper than buying at the bar. We had our own little sitting area that was completely empty. This dude acted like he was doing us the biggest favour in the world to be sitting there. He later sends us some girls over who are just looking to get some free drinks from us. They were beautiful, sure, but seriously? I know it's Vegas and everything but come on! We shooed them away and off they went to the only other table in our area with people at it, who were hooting and hollering them over. They chatted with the guys, got their free drinks, then took off making out with various random dudes and getting free drinks along the way. Then off they vanished never to be seen again...

They have all different types of food to satisfy your tastes and the portions are large enough to keep you full for most of the day.

A lot of people opted to get the salad, soup, and sandwich combo, which gets you a lot for cheap. I got the chicken jambalaya, expecting pasta, but got white rice instead. it was still good, but tasted more Asian than anything else despite the spiciness.

At the suggestion of the waiter/cashier I went with the burger, fries and drink special which cashed me out at ten dollars and change.  Add a $1.00 tip in the jar and the total was about $11.50.\\n\\nThe timeliness of the service from order to eating was very good; however, quality may have been trumped for timeliness.  Once the burger was delivered I noticed the top of the bun was cool (which in this case may have been room temperature since I needed a jacket to dine here).  I then noticed the preformed \\\"Angus\\\" patty (which I can buy at Costco) between a store-bought bun.  \\n\\nAt this point, let me explain to all burger peddlers my Burger Ratings Formula.  All burgers start with a \\\"10\\\" rating (10 being the best).  If a burger is served with a  store bought bun, -2 points.  If the meat is a preformed, previously frozen, store bought patty, -2 points.  Cold or cool bun, -2 points.\\n\\nBack to Chicago Dogs........Unfortunately, before I even bit into this burger it had a rating of 4.......but, I was willing to be oooooooed and awwwwwwwed by what was between the sterile beef patty and the bun.  Again, unfortunately I was not.  My mouth met with dill pickles, dill peppers, diced (what I think was) bell pepper, one slice of tomato, and one lonely ring of onion.  If these are the type of flavors that \\\"blow your skirt up\\\" on a hamburger then more power to ya........but it wasn't for me.  Put these same condiments with a fresh ground beef patty and a warm specialty bun, and I may sing a different tune.\\n\\nThe fries appeared fresh cut and were quite good.  Unfortunately, when I grabbed for the ketchup for some dipping and mopping the greasy plastic red dispenser was empty. I glanced at the two tables next to me an noticed that the ketchup dispensers were also nearly empty.  This gave rise to the thought, \\\"How long has the ketchup been in these bottles?\\\"  I ate the fries dry.\\n\\nOn my departure, the waiter/cashier asked me how the burger was.  I mentioned that the bun was cold.  He replied, \\\"That's strange.\\\"  I wanted to offer more of my good information to help him and his business improve on this American staple but he never said anything else.  As I turned and began to walk out I said, \\\"Thank you.\\\"   He said nothing. I guess i hurt his feelings with the cold bun comment.  He need  not worry, I won't be back.\n\nAnswer:",

It's beautiful, it feels \\\"authentic,\\\" and I haven't had a bad dish. Plus, most of the staff is actually from Ireland and are all really friendly! \\n\\nI've tried a few dishes since each visit was with a large group and allowed for a greater variety of samplings. During this visit, I ordered the \\\"IRISH POTATO CAKES\\\" again and it was good. It had a mashed potato consistency with a nice crust and tasty seasoning. Great contrast between the sour cream-like sauce and balsamic reduction drizzle. I also ordered the \\\"UNIQUELY VEGGIE\\\" burger (housemade white bean patty, crumbled goat cheese, sun dried tomato pesto, cucumber, caramelized onions on toasted wheat) with a side of housemade chips. The patty was really great and everything came together well. The goat cheese was a tad too much, but that's just the nature of the cheese. It also needed a little more flavor or just salt, which is a simple fix.\\n\\nTheir bar is wonderful too. I ordered a Jameson + Ginger and it had a generous serving of Jameson, plus delicious. Ruben enjoyed a Guiness Foreign Extra Stout (very cool Guiness store next door!).\n\nAnswer:",

Pilates and Zumba are my personal favorites. There's a sauna, hot tub and pool, but I wouldn't venture in there because of all the people who think it's a shower.

I've had some good food there, I've had some mediocre food there. Their fries are great...It's bar food, really. There's nothing that sets Four Peaks apart from a culinary standpoint, but most people seem to fall head over heels for the beer.\\n\\nHere's my thing: I'm from Portland, Oregon. For anyone that doesn't know, it's an incredible place for microbreweries and amazing beer. In the state of Oregon there are dozens of independent breweries and hundreds of incredible local beer choices...\\n\\n(I realize at this point you're all thinking - \\\"Hey, asshole. Stop talking about Portland. This is a review about Four Peaks\\\" - I'm getting to my point, I promise)\\n\\nUpon my arrival in the Phoenix area, I kept hearing about how great the beer was at Four Peaks. Living close by, I checked out Four Peaks early on, and have been back a number of times since. I've tried a lot of their beers, and they just don't do it for me. I like the Kilt Lifter, and that's the end...The rest of their beers I am just not into. Specifically the Hef...It's the worst Hef I've ever had in my life. Forgive me, I'm a beer snob who likes what he likes, and most of the beers at Four Peaks are not my thing. With that said, everyone else seems to be in love with them, so maybe I'm the crazy one.\\n\\nThe other thing that sucks about Four Peaks is the wait. During peak times, you're waiting anywhere from 30-60 minutes for a table.\\n\\nPositives is the size of the restaurant (it's huge), and the ambiance. It's a cool place to hang out and watch a game, and it's a good place to grab a quick bite when the wait isn't too long. I'm sure I'll come back to Four Peaks, but it won't be for the beer.\n\nAnswer:",

So I called Duke Energy and spoke with them about outdoor lighting .\\n            They said the install was free and it would be x number of dollars a month I thought that was a fair amount so 2 lights where installed . All went well until about 4 weeks later both lights went out? I called and requested a service  call thinking it was the bulbs it did seem strange that both went out at the same time.\\n            Around a week later I called Duke and asked when where they coming out to repair these lights? After going threw 3 people or more I was told that the lights where turned off? I asked why? I was told that my power was scheduled for disconnect the next day? I asked why they said that someone? had called and said they where moving ? I said Oh really? i just moved here less than 6 month ago!\\n            To make a long story short it seemed that there was a road by the same name close by and the addresses where confused? I said you have 3 email addresses for me 3 phone numbers I was not called to insure this order was CORRECT  before disconnect AND who verified my information on the disconnect order? No one!\\n            SO...lets just say they cut my power off no one was home except one of my elderly parents that may have to have some sort of machine the runs on electricity ? That could have killed them! Not to mention if I had left for vacation everything in the freezer would have been ruined and those beautiful expensive fish in the tank more than likely would be DEAD!!!!\\n             So when I told Duke that I was never called nor was the disconnect order verified they told me\\\" They cannot contact everyone its would take to much time!!!\\\" Then I asked \\\"is this ever done?\\\" And was told well... no.

I had the Mulligatawny Soup, Garlic Naan, and the Tandoori Chicken.  The food was really good (awesome Naan!) and the portions were quite large.  The chicken was out-of-this-world and I could not finish it all. \\n\\nThe only negative was the service. I dined on a Tuesday evening at 6:30ish. It took a long time for my waiter to take my order. Though the place seemed relatively full. There were only two waitstaff.  When i arrived, there seemed to be several employees outside smoking. Also, My waiter was not of Indian descent, which is perfectly fine, but he did not speak English, thus my questions about the menu and what he recommended went unanswered. It also took a long time for my food to arrive. From the time I sat down to the time my food arrived was almost an hour. \\n\\nAll-in-all, I would go back again because the food was very good. I would have given 4 stars, save for the awful customer service.\n\nAnswer:",

We were seated quickly, waited for about 10 minutes for a server and no one came. We eventually had to go up to the bar to ask for someone to take out order. The bartender was very apologetic, friendly and took our order quickly. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, BF got a bacon cheddar burger and the little one got a cheese burger off the kids menu. \\n\\nSalad was very tasty with good portions and lot of different ingredients for a nice variety of flavor. BFs burger was bland, and they forgot his onion strings. It was a couple dollars extra for the burger meal to be upgraded with sweet potato fries. They were decent, all 15 of them. The kids meal burger was incredible tasteless with a stale bun. She took 3 bites and refused to eat the rest. \\n\\nAll in all, we will not come back. We were offered a free desert for the lack of service, which was good and a nice gesture, which warrants 2 stars.\n\nAnswer:",

It wasn't bad, but for half the price I had the same thing at The Original Pancake House  this morning and enjoyed it just as much or possibly more.  Granted, I could have ordered something with a little bit more imagination, but if a restaurant can't handle simple things then I have to wonder whether or not it can handle more complex items.  \\n\\nThe hummus appetizer we ordered arrived with sesame seed covered pita for dipping.  Unfortunately, I can't say much for the hummus because it was completely overwhelmed by the flavor of the sesame seeds on the pita.  I'm not a fan of sesame seeds, so I took one bite and left it at that.  My companion ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad and really enjoyed it.  He also enjoyed the hummus more than I, but he likes sesame seeds so....\\n\\nThanks to a $30 gift certificate from Groupon, our lunch tab was only $18.00.  (I paid $12 for GC and left $6 tip.)  Without the GC, our tab would have been almost twice as much.  I'll try Terrace Cafe again because I have another gift certificate.  Hopefully next time I'll be as pleased with my meal as some of the other reviewers.\n\nAnswer:",

Well, the Belgian fries are nothing more than thick-cut fries.  Apparently, they've changed their policy a bit since previous reviewers were there because you now get 2 sauces with your burger .   I had no idea I didn't get to try a little of this and a little of that...and the guy behind the counter was really snippy with me that I can only try two.  (he didn't tell me there was the option of buying more than two.)  Oh...and although they advertize that they have 20 sauces, they actually only had 14.\\nThe burger for $8 was fine...nothing special.  The fries for $3, also nothing special.  It was all tasty...but nothing above average.  The sauces I tried were an ancho chili sauce and an olive sauce - both were good.  I'd eat here again but I wasn't impressed with the sauce dude.  I realize that in Vegas, they don't have to worry about repeat business and therefore, they can be as snippy as they want.  They know that they don't depend on repeat business.\n\nAnswer:",

My daughter got a free kids meal coupon at a Halloween event and when we went to use it we were met with ignorance and disdain. She ordered a taco kids meal. When she went to tell them what toppings she would like on her chicken taco, they advised that the rice and beans on the side were all that came with it. Seriously? She got a corn tortilla and some grilled chicken and that's it for her taco? The lady advised it would be extra $ for any toppings which I elected to pay. I ordered a grilled chicken salad and got the skimpiest little salad I have ever gotten at a Chipotle. Were they running out of food on a Sunday? I don't understand how the salad I got from this location was literally a third of the size of the one I normally get from the west Sahara and/or the North Durango locations.

Most of my reviews consist of me bragging about how unrealistically hot I am, how even my cheapest article of clothes costs thousands of dollars, how awesome my hair looks, and how your personal opinions are WRONG and my opinions are Scientific Facts. If I were a Buddhist, I would chose to be reincarnated as myself. Though it is true that I have too much money to spend and an extremely high opinion of myself, what I am practically trying to do is exactly what the \\\"heel character\\\"(aka the bad guy) does at the Pro-Wrestling shows. I talk sh!t on every onlooker until they can't stand it anymore and send me tons of death threats, insults, and angry messages. Sometimes I wonder if I have Oppositional Defiant Disorder, because I seem to get high on annoying and pissing people off.  But, I promise that this will be my last Schtick review.....maybe..\\n\\nNow on to the review....\\n\\nPeople in Las Vegas are pretty stupid, but people in NW Las Vegas are even worse. Las Vegas is like DUMB and NW Vegas is like DUMBER. So practically what we got here is a city full of Harrys and Lloyds. So, I can understand why some people would give this place a low-rating because they don't have the intelligence, class, and sophistication(Like I have) to enjoy such a fine bowl of Vietnamese Pho.\\n\\nThe Pho itself is extremely oily. This is natural! You really want to see oil rise to the top of soups like Pho and Tonkatsu Ramen. Why? Because that is the first visual indication that the broth is made from boiling bones for over 16+ hours.  If the soup has no oils rise to the top, it means that either the bones were not boiled long enough or they used a powder mix to make the broth.  The only times I ever see anything more greasy and oily than Natural Pho is when I have to look at the profile pictures of the Elite Yelper's faces(Of course not counting the Elites who are on my friends list, who are all like extremely hot like myself).\\n\\nThe Steak they use at PHO ROSE is very tender, soft, and lean. I think they might be using sirloin.  Just a note: I know that most of you NW Vegas residents live paycheck-to-paycheck. I know most you guys barely make enough money to pay the bills. I also know that you are used to eating Grade F Low Quality beef from Walmart. But, Sophisticated(like me), wealthy(like me), and Upper-Class people(like me), eat nothing but Organic Sirloin and Filet everyday. So unlike you guys, I know a good piece of steak when I see one. And, PHO ROSE has some good quality meat. \\n\\nOkay...the portions here are not as big as the places on Spring Mountain. But, the prices are a bit lower. Also, lets factor in the convenience of not having to drive 30 minutes in bad traffic to Spring Mountain and Valley View.  You know, if you have to complain about a $7.50 bowl of Pho being too expensive then you shouldn't be eating out at all. You should be saving your welfare checks to pay rent at your weekly-rate roach infested apartments.  So maybe next time, don't blow your paycheck on your gambling addiction, and don't spend so much money getting drunk and stupid at bars...... and maybe you won't have to complain about $7.00 being \\\"too expensive\\\". \\n\\nOkay... I noticed my Yelp Friend Mike C gave this place a 1-star review. I respect his review. I noticed he last ate here in 2010. I think he should give this place another try because I think they have made a lot of changes.\\n\\nSo, I would eat here again on account of the food, service, and convenience.  The only thing that might keep me away is the fact that this place is located near Summerlin. I don't know why, but every time I come back to Summerlin, the people just keep getting uglier!  Does a privileged and good looking guy like me really want to lower his standards and eat amongst the obese alcoholic bottom feeders of Summerlin? \\n\\nAnyway...PHO ROSE gets 5-Stars for being the best Pho in the NW.\n\nAnswer:",

We  signed in OK, when our pager light up, we went up to the hostess stand expecting to be seated.  No, that was just to tell us to stand in a different spot. I have a hard time standing so I had given up my seat while waiting, If we knew we had to wait again, I would have stayed where I was!! Then we passed up several empty tables and booths to be seated in the back by the kitchen.  They then took forever before our waiter came over and another 30 minutes to get our sodas and lemonade. Then it was an hour before we got our food.  At one point, our waiter did come over and we were talking to him and the people at the next table called him and he turned around and waited on them.  We were mid sentence and he left us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was so incredibly rude!!!!  Then when the other table left and they were cleaning off the table, the busboy stacked the glasses so high that the bottom glass shattered from the pressure.  There was glass all over and they only cleaned up part of it, my husband was trying to point out more glass and they obviously DID NOT like it being pointed out.  So he got up to go find the manager and told him what all was going on. He did come by our table for about 2 seconds and said he would go check on our food. That obviously upset the kitchen.  One son ordered a BBQ bacon burger and it was so dry and bland (no BBQ sauce on it and burger itself was dry and flavorless) that he could not eat.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it also was dry! I only ate about a quarter of it. My other son is usually ravenous and eats anything. I gave him half of my sandwich and he only took 1 bite and said no thanks.  Anyway, that gives you an idea of what we thought of the food.  And the table with the broken glass, well we kept pointing out where more glass was and they finally finished cleaning BUT there was still more broken glass under the table.  I hope that whoever sits at that table with sandals on and cuts there foot sees this so they know it was pure negligence on the part of the restaurant!!!!\n\nAnswer:",

For a somewhat renovated hotel, it is what it is, and would probably be worth staying at again for the value.  But, since all of us Yelpers base our reviews on the entire experience, let me expand why the Trop only gets two:\\n\\nMy sister and I were celebrating our birthday weekend in Veags (we're twins) and had booked a Saturday night at the Trop via an online deal.  Excited, since we've never stayed there before but knew it was this famous place on the strip, we looked into good food around the area, and what else we can do that was close.  Having stayed at other hotels not in the middle of the strip before, discovering that the Tropicana was much more south than what was ideal, we made the most of it and understood there would be some travelling in the car.  Okay, no problem.  We made dinner reservations further up the strip and booked show tickets at Planet Hollywood.  We were set.\\n\\nWe arrive in Vegas around 1:30pm, and decide to have lunch first before checking in, since it was too early to do so and our lunch reservation was North Strip.  After lunch and some games, we head down a little bit after 4pm (check-in begins at 3), and that's when the trouble starts.  4pm, and our room wasn't ready?  Hmmm, okay, how long, we ask?  About 45 mins to an hour.  Ugh.\\n\\nSo, we take whatever is available, which is a smoking room (we had reserved a non-smoking one), and as the woman is giving us our keys, we hear the party checking in next to us getting keys for their NON-SMOKING room.  What???  We ask, are there no other non-smoking rooms left, even if we upgraded?  No, she said.  Nothing we can do about it... can't wait an hour for the other room because we had show tickets... so we headed to our smoking floor and our smoking room.\\n\\nWhich, brings us back to the beginning.  Smoking room wasn't bad.  Had a bit of a smell but once you get the air going, it didn't linger.  The room was clean and the beds were comfy.  And the HD TV actually had an HD signal.  Awesome.\\n\\nSo, next time, when you book, call ahead to see if the room is ready, and if you are doing things in the middle of the strip, stay closer to where you'll be.  The Trop, as cool as it was to actually stay there, isn't worth the trouble (or the trouble parking in the small garage), and you'll most likely think you're getting your money's worth elsewhere.\n\nAnswer:",

Their food is excellent and so is the service.  This particular trip to FEZ was slightly disappointing, but I can say that I will still return.  Let me set the scene....\\nMy mother met me at work to take her to lunch for her birthday.  It was her and I along with my grandmother and Aunt.  The older ladies were a bit put off by the menu, but got the cheeseburger and LOVED it.  My mom and I shared the shrimp kisra.  I was disappointed that they did not have the $8.95 lunch special advertised on their website, but the kisra was very good.... until... we found a hair.  It was blatantly not one of our own and so we beckoned Candace, our server, to replace the plate and she did promptly.  The second kirsa was not as crispy as the first, but is was sans hair so that was fine.  All in all we enjoyed lunch, but the experience wasn't that great.  The manager, who was supposed to bring us dessert, comped the kisra instead and never stopped by our table, which I thought to be a bit classless.  However, Candace was wonderful and understanding.  She worked quite well in an awkward situation and because of her, I will be dining at FEZ again in the future.  Just hopefully there will be no unwanted extras on my plate.\n\nAnswer:",

It is right in the center of the Las Vegas Strip.  You can walk to Caesars Palace,  The Bellagio, The Venetian and even the Fashion Show Mall.  When I visit Vegas again,  I would not mind booking another room here.  Our room was not fancy but it was quite comfortable and it was cleaned every day.  The elevators worked well, which was great, because we were on the 19th floor.  The hotel did have a few cons. Of course, just like most hotels on The Strip, \\\"The Mirage\\\" has an imperative resort fee.  It was kind of unfortunate because I never used any of the amenities.  Oh, and try really hard to not grab anything from the mini fridge.  The items were expensive!  My friend was really thirsty and she grabbed a small drink from the mini fridge.  It was around 3 bucks!  Just ignore the cons and you will still have a great time at this hotel.  Before you leave Vegas, make sure to check some attractions at The Mirage.  Listen to the live music at BB King's Blues Club, get a Mocha Mudslide Milkshake from BLT Burger and watch the free Volcano show outside.  The Mirage also has the Cirque du Soleil: The Beatles LOVE show.  I did not have a chance to see it but there is always next time!  :-)\n\nAnswer:",

I've been going to clubs in Vegas since RA in 2002 several times a year. Ive always called up a promoter and made a reservation for a table earlier in the day and get hooked up. The last few times I have been doing LAX with the same guy and its always smooth. We wanted to hit up Rain this time to see Fabolous so I made the mistake of booking and paying $580 online in advance on Tuesday and was told I would be contacted soon. I never was and waited until 2pm on Friday to look into it. \\n\\n Big fucking mistake. Don't do it. I wasted 2 hours of my afternoon Friday trying to track down someone who could confirm my reservation. Was bounced back and forth between n9ne group, rain, and eventbrite. The women on the phone from rain were rude as fuck.\\n\\nI had figured that once they had your money they wouldn't give a fuck what happens next which seemed to be true. Finally got squared away and was seated in a \\\"VIP\\\" area to the left of the stage but the area had a bar in the back that was open to everyone. I'm not some asshole that needs to be behind velvet ropes but if I pay 600 bucks for a table I don't want anyone randomly sitting at it. The whole night there was random people popping up at our table, asking for drinks, asking for smokes, even putting their stank bare feet on the table... We threw our bouncer a 20 for holding it down and he was real cool about it.....our waitress was real cool too. We bought a second bottle for about $520 and were having a good time. Dave Fogg threw down a sick ass set dressed up as Jason (Friday the 13th)....Fabolous was cool but the set was super hard to hear for some reason.  \\n\\nWhen the club was shutting down we were told we couldn't  bring the last of the Vodka out of the club but the bouncer said if we pay him we could!  Fuck that....We already spent over 1100 on 2 bottles and tipped him 20 bucks to do his job.  Ended up taking the bottle and no one said shit...Rain sucks for the whole VIP set up. Too much of a hassle and not worth the nonsense. I would go again but never pay in advance and would hope we wouldn't be subjected to a fucking bribe.

Overall, food I would give 3.5, service 4, atmosphere 1.\\n\\nIt was just SO LOUD the entire time. This place is more bar than restaurant. I've never been to a nice restaurant where it is appropriate to YELL to your friends. It would be one thing if the bar and restaurant were separate but they are not. Also, the lighting was constantly changing on a loop. Bar area fine, but right at our table? The whole table glowed red, orange, yellow, green, blue, red, orange, yellow...... the ENTIRE time. It got annoying after a little while.\\n\\nWhen we first arrived we had to wait, which was not a huge problem. It would have been less of a problem if I wasn't 7.5 months pregnant and forced to stand in the doorway while the party crowd spread out in the lounge and bar area. I don't really expect people to move for me just because I'm pregnant, but in this case there was plenty of room - your purse doesn't need its own seat. I don't blame the restaurant for that, though it would have really been nice if one of the hostesses or bartenders could have offered up one of the empty seats. Though to be honest, I didn't really want to jump in the middle of all the yelling.\\n\\nOnce we were seated the experience was better. The food was fairly good. We ordered the cheese plate for an appetizer, which was OK. I would recommend some nuts and maybe some pears or other less sweet fruits that would complement the cheeses instead of the blueberries and strawberries which didn't go with the plate. I ordered the Spring Salad, which was excellent. My husband got the gumbo which he really enjoyed. He ordered the dinner special, which was a filet and lobster tail. He said the filet was a little overdone, the lobster was OK - nothing special. I ordered the chocolate raviolis, which were good. They were covered in a thick, rich, cream sauce. Tasted very good, though there was nothing healthy about it! For dessert we split the banana cream pie sundae which was by far the best part of the meal. SO GOOD. \\n\\nOur server was very attentive, constantly filling our water and asking if we needed anything. He didn't seem to be fully knowledgeable about the menu - had to ask about the cheese plate and didn't know how big the filet was - but his service and attentiveness was excellent. He did a good job.\\n\\nWhen I made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything and I told them that it was our anniversary. They didn't acknowledge that, which was fine, but why ask?\\n\\nI would rate this place higher if they would ditch the looping neon lights and make the dining area quieter so you don't have to yell at the person next to you just to have a conversation. It's definitely not a good place for a romantic date. Maybe I should give this place another shot when I can drink again.\n\nAnswer:",

The cashew chicken was nice little shreds of grilled chicken, but was \\\"not as good as other places\\\".

I had never been into the establishment that was here prior, but I've been told that it's basically the same layout. It's much larger than it looks from the outside; it has four separate dining areas and an open bar area that is just all-around inviting.

Oh, and they have a bad ass digital jukebox music player thing in the bar area, very cool.\\n\\nWe had the opportunity to sample a few of their dishes, however, I feel that I can't fairly judge them on mass production or catering/buffet-style (when they're not meant that way). Overall, everything was good. We tried their pasta with meat sauce (pretty sure it was Bombardoni pasta), meatballs in marinara, Italian sausage and peppers, three types of pizza, calamari, mozzarella sticks, Antipasti, and desserts. The pasta was good, but I didn't care for the meat in the sauce. Same with the meatballs and the sausage (although the sausage was better). Marinara was good and complemented the fresh calamari. They did completely different types of pizza, but common was the yummy dough. I liked the thinner crust version better and one had a sesame bottom like a hamburger bun that was actually fun and yummy! The desserts weren't exciting, but I did really enjoy the apple turnover.\\n\\nGreat experience, however, the food was just okay for me. I definitely like the location and the atmosphere.

The food was dissappointingly mediocre, with one exception (the miso black cod which was quite good).  I sort of expected that.  What I didn't expect was the horrible service.  The waitress kept leaving the table after taking one persons order without allowing the rest of the party to order their dinner.  We had to keep stopping her and telling her to come back for the rest of the order.  We had only ordered a few appetizers previously so I'm not sure what she was thinking.  We waited 30 minutes for one of our pre dinner drinks and 30 min for a hot tea I ordered after dinner.  She forgot one of our rolls.  And she never seemed the slightest apologetic or embarrassed.

He got off on the wrong exit and took us up some more surface streets.

It was probably the most tastefully decorated hotel room I've ever stayed in. Even though the room faced the \\\"wrong\\\" direction (towards the north), it still provided an amazing view. The bed in the room was the best I've ever slept on. The layout of the room is very efficient, but you won't be able to comfortably fit many more than the prescribed number of people in it (as opposed to the Palazzo). Housekeeping was extraordinary; not only keeping the room immaculate, but also finding fun and creative ways of organizing your daily aftermath of Vegas debauchery.\\n\\nThe common areas: Absolutely magnificently decorated. As tacky as it sounds, attention was given to literally every inch of this hotel. Throughout our 3-night stay, we constantly caught new details of each area we passed. It is literally unlike any other place I've been and makes the Venetian/Palazzo look like a tacky mess.\\n\\nThe restaurants: Ate at the Buffet, Le Cave and Tableau. The buffet is probably the best one you can get in vegas. Le Cave was very mediocre. Sunday brunch at Tableau was the best breakfast I've ever had in my life (no exaggeration). Generally, the prices were reasonable by Vegas standards.\\n\\nThe pools: Most of our time was spent at the European pool, which was absolutely great. It has great decor, music, drinks, and a topless-optional policy for the female guests. There is also a quieter family-friendly pool not far away too, which provides a great chance to relax. If you only take one piece of my advice: Avoid the Beach Club like the plague.\\n\\nThe clubs: It's a shame; a lot of time/money was obviously put into developing these clubs, but they are managed extremely poorly (especially regarding security). The security at the clubs are either too lax (XS) or downright fascist (Beach Club). If you want to go to either club, read my specific reviews on each in order to know what you're getting yourself into.\\n\\nLe Reve: On this trip, I saw Ka, Crazy Horse, Love and Le Reve. Of the four shows, this one was #3 (Crazy Horse being the best, Love being the worst). The acrobatics were impressive, albeit repetitive, but the story is very simple and, at the same time, hard to follow. It wasn't a bad show, but not worthy of its high price-tag, in my opinion.\\n\\nThis resort is truly a gem. However, you'll need to research each part of the resort that you plan to visit, as there is a surprising lack of consistency from one place to the next.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm a no-frills coffee drinker, so I've never tried any of the specialty/blended drinks. Judging by the menu they're up to a dollar cheaper than most coffee chains; a lot of other reviewers seem to love them. That being said, the coffee and espresso, while not the best I've ever had, is VERY tasty - I could probably drink it black, though I usually ask for a little bit of cream, just so it cools down quicker. The chocolate covered espresso bean that comes with every drink is a nice touch too.\\n\\nThe baristas are super friendly, helpful, speedy and always remember what you prefer, even if you only show up once every couple weeks (I'll admit that it doesn't hurt that all the baristas that have served me here are pretty girls with cheery personalities). My first time there, about a year ago, they explained their punch card and specials - there's a double punch day (Wednesday), you get a free drink once the card is full and I'm pretty sure they have a happy hour, I think it's from 4-6.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that I don't live very close to this location any more! It was really convenient on days that I didn't have time to make my own coffee at home. I wish they'd open more locations. Lucky for me, my mom still lives in this area, so when I visit her I always make a stop.\\n\\nBottom line: Convenient if you're in the area, great staff, fast service and damn good espresso.\n\nAnswer:",

He opted for the Deep Tissue Massage with Traci and I had the Therapeutic Massage with Kelly. It had been a log overdue treatment for me and Kelly was AMAZING. She was gentle yet firm in areas that needed to be worked through and my body felt like butter after it was over. I was also pleasantly surprised that she asked me if I wanted the oil removed from my body. Yes, please! She spent an extra 5-10 minutes cleaning me off with a hot towel and even that process was gentle and massage-like. We will definitely return again soon!\n\nAnswer:",

I've heard amazing stories about Marquee in NYC/ the newer Vegas location and I was so excited to see the Vegas version. We were all ready to shake our booties and get down Vegas style. However, even with after pre-gaming a bit,  I guess our first mistake was coming in on a Thursday night. Half of our group (the Vegas regulars) swore by Marquee and decided this was a good first stop for our Vegas trip. \\n\\nUpon entering, the club closed off it's other levels and only the \\\"basement\\\" was open. It was so small and only two club dancers were performing above the dance floor. It was so crowded on the small space and apparently they let anyone in tonight because I saw woman wearing sweats and sneakers? and guys who look like they just got in from going to the gym or something... really? This type of attire doesn't fly in NYC or nice restaurants. You don't need to be dressed to the 9's, but come on, sneakers are a absolute no no. How can people dress like that to a club? After that shock,  a lot of people, like us, went outside to chill on the balcony. \\n\\nTo top off this experience, we wanted to order shots but many of the liquors were sold out. We peaced out after 30 minutes even when the guys just paid to get in. I was told this isn't an accurate depiction of Marquee LV... let's hope they rarely have these off nights because it was very disappointing. I think I'll just stick to my usual Vegas spots...\n\nAnswer:",

Took this company's cab from the airport to a hotel on the Strip. The driver who don't talk at all just asked us if we are on vacation right before the sign for the freeway. Being local here and working closely with tourists, I knew what he was doing. He was checking to see if he could steal from us. After finding out that we are local, he slowly merged to the lane he should have been long time ago and ended up taking the right way instead of cheating the route. \\n\\nHe was not friendly at all and didn't say a word. I didn't need him to be over friendly but I could just see him thinking \\\"this isn't going to make me money.\\\" The attitude was there all the way. I ended up tipping him a little bit more than 20 % and he reluctantly counted in front of us and shook his head with a sarcastic expression on his face like we are cheap customers. So later that night, when I needed a help from a lock-smith company, the gentleman was so helpful and friendly. He ended up getting $20 from us just by showing up. \\n\\nI hope the company cares about all these bad reviews. This driver made the company look like they just want money even if it means dishonest operations. It is very sad that this type of drivers is the first point of contact to welcome tourists and business people from all over the world.\n\nAnswer:",

BC offers also snacks such as catfish with fries, chicken strips, chicken wings and lemon pepper, regular or cajun fries too. per tray is about $6 to $8 and they were yummy, bun and I might get this every time because you can mix and match what fries you'd like so you can get the best of best worlds ^^\\n\\nThe bill was interesting -- because the total for BC was about the same as HnJ, BC was about $45-$50 with tip because my server was awesome and HnJ was about $40 with tip.

I'm always up for an all night dance party so I gladly paid ahead of time for a ticket to Calvin Harris on Saturday night. Although I know it's possible for girls to get in free pretty much anywhere in Vegas, to me this ticket was totally worth it to not have to worry about standing in ridiculous lines or bribing bouncers. \\n\\nThe entry was confusing, as there were several different security and promoter people who kept herding us to different areas and telling us different things about what we needed - should we have our printed tickets out? Is an email pulled up on a phone ok? It took a while for everyone to finally get in the door because of all of the confusion. \\n\\nOnce in, I have to say I was surprised that the interior wasn't more exciting and over the top. I expect big and bold and beautiful from Vegas clubs, but what I saw was more like what an 80s nightclub would look like in movies, with black everywhere and somewhat cheesy neon lights. I also thought the layout wasn't smart, as everyone is naturally directed to this one staircase to get to and from the dance floor and bars, which of course meant that everything got extremely congested. I know this is a hot club right now, but the crowds were ridiculous... I could barely move the whole night. \\n\\nThese kinds of crowds also encourage theft. Four girls out of about eight in my group of friends got their iPhones and/or wallets stolen. Now we're not talking about people carelessly leaving their purses in booths and wandering away. These purses were on shoulders, and one or more a-holes were obviously using the crowd as a way to bump into people and dig in their bags. Several girls all around me that I didn't know also fell victim. It was really hard to dance my booty off when every few minutes I heard some poor girl scream 'my phone's gone!!!' Clutching my purse tightly to me, I told several security guards, all of whom nodded vaguely while avoiding eye contact. I knew they weren't telling anyone. And of course no one returned our calls when we called their number that night and the next morning. We were no longer their problem! \\n\\nI know in Vegas it's not really about convenience but about the wild night and the scene you're a part of. For that part of it Hakkasan did what I expected. But when it comes to treating your customers right, ones that are very likely to spread the word and come back and spend a lot of money if treated well, they unfortunately failed miserably.\n\nAnswer:",

Maybe the hotdog on a stick, your favorite store, or maybe you just really enjoy build a bear... It's okay you don't have to share your secrets with me. Anyways, Galleria is the mall that we go to when we need something, It is definitely not anything to write home about, only something to write to an online reviewing site about. \\n\\nThe mall has a great selection of stores with some of the larger department stores as well as many different boutique type stores. They also have a full food court as well as full service restaurants with Chevy' and Red Robin attached to the mail. You can also grab a quick car wash from the guy that sets up in the parking lot for 14.99. How can you resist that offer, an Orange Julius and a tire shine is simply perfection on a Saturday afternoon right?\\n\\nThe bottom line here is that it is definitely a mall, it houses all the stores you need to find your outfit for that hot date or some prank gifts for that jackass buddy you have that you really don't want to buy a gift for but if you don't you will then be the jackass...  If you are looking for something and are in the Henderson area this would be your place to get it.\n\nAnswer:",

To me, this place unfortunately took all of the character out of what was once my favorite coffee shop in the city. Furthermore, I thought that this place was actually a Tree Roasters, but when I walked in to buy a bag of coffee for a family member for Christmas they said they only brew the coffee and do not sell it. The bagels are cheap and pretty good- but they always are way too liberal if you ask for butter or cream cheese on them. Every time I get a bagel, the bag is completely soaked in butter by the time I walk the two blocks to work and I have to scrape off a layer from the top. On the inside of the building, the setup seems too forced, the lack of seating at the bar limits interaction between customers and workers- it just seems like they paved paradise and put up a parking lot.....\n\nAnswer:",

Its right around the corner from Chase Field, and neither of us had been here before.  We had an excellent time together at Coach and Willies, but I think we both left with a feeling of something to be desired by this place.  Here's my take on the place:\\n\\nI dont think this place is bad.  I just think its not the greatest.  Scott and I did enjoy our time here, BUT, I think we both found the same things annoying about it.\\n\\nFirst, I feel like theres a conflict of decorating.  I feel like theres two completely different themes going on here, and they both clash with one another.  Part of it seems like it wants to be a nicer resturant....the other part wants to be a sports bar.  Neither one compliments each other.  \\n\\nWhen you walk in, theres a great patio area for dining.  Loved it!  But, then when you walk in, and kind of walk around, it shows signs of trying to be a sports bar.  The bar itself is set really low.  Lower then the tables themselves.  Heavy marble looking bar tops, with chairs.  \\n\\nAt one point Scott and I counted 15 (YES 15!) flat screen TVs!  I will say, there was one particular TV in our area that I noticed that had amazing reception.  It was probably one of the better flat screens I have seen!  \\n\\nTo my benefit, I ordered the half nachos.  The server ended up bringing me out a full plate of nachos (bonus!) and I was happy!  Food here is so so.  \\n\\nI feel like this place is a place I would probably bring my parents to, but it really didnt blow me away.\n\nAnswer:",

May it be from me ordering a Chicken bowl online, then to get home and there is no Chicken. Or I order a Chicken bowl and the Chicken is burnt to a crisp, not just seared or chard but burnt. \\n\\nThen there was the time that rice was still kinda wet, so it was more of a burrito soup bowl.

I eat it all in one meal, and am still hungry. \\n\\nWhen I order a bowl at Chipotle in Peoria, Prescott, Salem Or, Covallis Or... etc... It is always, and I stress always two meals. \\n\\nThis Chipotle is so bad, I will drive to Peoria all the way down Bell Rd to get Chipotle vs. Going to the one in Surprise, the customer service is always rude, rushing, don't smile, and don't conduct business how they should.\n\nAnswer:",

I appreciate their healthy take and their vast vegan and gluten free options.\\n\\nI have been to Bombay about five or six times over the course of the last year, and have eaten some of their items at Yelp events. I have never disliked any of the items I have tried, but there have certainly been a few items I found less than flavorful (vegetable lentil soup, cauliflower, spicy veggie curry).\\n\\nLast week I tried the seared tofu, and it was absolutely amazing. It is an appetizer, but comes with five or six good sized slices of tofu, and I would eat it as a meal. I also fell in love with the DELICIOUS tofu masala. I couldn't be happier with either of those selections and highly recommend them. \\n\\nI also like that you get to choose two menu items and have it served in a variety of ways (plated with rice, lettuce wraps, roti taco, etc). It gives a little extra variety depending on your mood. \\n\\nOne complaint I have is that they do not know which wines are vegan. To have a separate menu focusing on vegan entrees and to not know what complimentary drinks are also vegan leaves me a little dissatisfied.\\n\\nOverall, Bombay has good service, a good location next to Whole Foods, progressive menu items, is moderately priced, and has a good variety of items available for vegans and carnivores alike.\n\nAnswer:",

From the outside it may not look like much but upon entering the dark exterior you immediately find that this is quite the popular lunch spot! \\n\\nMy friend, Jillana, and I ventured into this hot spot at around 12:30pm on a Thursday. The tables were packed and there was already 6-7 people in line ahead of us. Despite the crowd our food was served in a matter of minutes and the owner, operating the cash register, noticed that we were new customers and offered up drinks on the house. A rarity for today's economy! The owner was extremely helpful and attentive (readily changed our order from din in to to-go and made sure we had plenty of napkins and plastic-ware before he sent us on our way). \\n\\nThe place itself is rather small but has a rather fun, lively lunch vibe to it. I always love the 80's posters of the attractive Greek bushy-eyebrowed brunette enjoying a big gyro :-) Not sure how busy it is around the dinner hour but it seems that this place will certainly not be going out of business anytime soon. \\n\\nMy friend and I both opted for the classic Greek gyro, costing only $7.30 after tax. Great prices! The sandwich was quite tasty. The meat was well seasoned, packed with flavor. The fries were quite good and my friend thoroughly enjoyed her Greek side salad. The only drawback was that the meat was a tad on the greasy side for my taste. However, this would not deter me from frequenting George's. Next time I would ask for extra tzatziki, there was some on the sandwich but I would have liked a bit more. Plus, I love dipping my fries in the rich creamy goodness as well. \\n\\nOverall, quite a good experience. Price, good. Service, good. Food, goooooood.\n\nAnswer:",

The main selling point of this hotel is probably its location. It's just a short walk away from Guy-Concordia station on the green line as well as Lucien L'Allier station on the orange line. It is close to the Centre Bell, in case you want to watch a hockey game, the Gare Central VIA rail station, and the Centre Eaton shopping mall and surrounding shops and restaurants. \\n\\nIn terms of the hotel room, it was pretty standard/basic. We stayed in room 610, which was on the 6th floor - apparently that is the executive floor. The room just looked like a regular room though with two beds, a flat screen TV, and a really tiny washroom. At least it was clean though, and the beds were pretty comfortable. It's not the most glamorous looking hotel, but it's alright and gets the job done for about $107/night on a Saturday night. A few things to note about our room: our safe didn't work, there was a handle missing from the closet door, and I found a towel with a small stain on it.\\n\\nThe staff at the hotel was pretty friendly and helpful for the most part. We had a slight hiccup on our first night when we went to check in around 3 pm, which is the standard check in time, and were told that our room wasn't ready yet and they were still preparing it. We ended up having to sit in the lobby for an extra 10-15 minutes until they finally called us over to give us our key. While it wasn't a huge deal, I wasn't impressed with the fact that the room wasn't ready for us when it should have been - it's not even like we arrived early or anything. Also, unfortunately for us, our room was right across from the elevator doors. It made it convenient to get to/from our room, but also made it so it was quite loud with all the people coming in and out. The walls are not super sound proof or anything, so we could hear people in the hallway late at night.\\n\\nThere is free unlimited wifi here. However, it was really slow and kept cutting in and out.\\n\\nOverall, I liked the location of the hotel and wouldn't really have a problem staying here again in the future for like one or two nights.

But that doesn't mean it's anything really special.\\n\\nThis place is always packed, probably due to its location & small size. They have 2 floors, but I've only really stayed upstairs (I hate underground bars). The set up just seems all wrong to me, but maybe I've just been here too late after mayhem has taken its toll. The bar is located along the back wall, & it can be tough to grab a beer if it's really crowded, but that's pretty much anywhere. The thing that irks me is the inability for you & a group of friends to really stand around & talk. There isn't much room to do anything, unless you love standing in really close quarters with your friends. Like I said though, maybe the mayhem of the night has already take its toll & screwed up the arrangement of things, but I think it's mostly due to the setup of the place. \\n\\nBrick & Barrel always has a line with people clamoring to get in, to become crowded amongst other people they don't know. Maybe if they didn't allow so many people inside I would like this place a little bit better, but on a busy night I try to stay away from here.

She didn't eat it because she was all, \\\"What'd you order that for...I don't eat red meat.\\\" \\n\\nOf course she doesn't. But I do. So I winked at the guy and he slid her plate my way. \\nIt was a good half burger. When I was numb, I went downstairs to La Fontanella to eat a bunch of Italian food. \\n\\nAnyways, oh yeah, The Little Woody is fun when you can have it all to yourself. Otherwise, get ready to do battle with the chick next to you, hoping to get the bartender's attention. Good luck. As if he's going to notice you when her thong is hiked up to her ear lobes and she's wearing a low cut top.\\n\\nDon't forget to limp into work Monday and remember, you've got ten toes.

Let's start...\\nArrival- there were a few people waiting when we got here, put our name in and were told about 10 minutes.  After 30 minutes of waiting, a party that arrived after us, and was a larger party, was seated. I went to ask the hostess how much longer we would be waiting and she said we were next. I pointed out that the people that arrived after us had been seated and the \\\"manager\\\" said \\\"yeah, if a smaller party is waiting we sometimes seat them first.\\\" I said, we have 4, they have 5. Her response was \\\"oh, well they were probably here before you, you just didn't see them.\\\" Nope.\\nSeated- finally get a table and there are waitstaff everywhere but no one is approaching us. At this time a party that arrived 15 minutes after is is seated next to us and is immediately approached for drink orders and given chips and salsa. We still have not even been greeted. At this point we realize why, the waiter that has been visiting with the party at the table next to us, we could hear him address them as \\\"mom\\\" and they are obviously family, comes over to take our drink order and leaves.  He returns and leaves our drinks. It's another 10 minutes before he takes our order. After he leaves again, we flag him down as we still do not even have chips and salsa.  Meanwhile our server is leaning on the host table chatting with hostesses and other waiters. We had to get his attention for refills after drinks were empty a while.\\nFood- well a bug was flying around and landed on my half eaten food, what I had was good, not great. My husband had carne asada and it was chewy, and burnt so bad the edges of the steak were curling up.\\nWe will never be back, and I know we are not the only ones.

I came here with a group of four people on a Saturday night around 12:30AM. This is prime time people. The Groupon I bought earlier the same night is what brought me to Vanguard.  \\n\\nPros: There's no cover charge.\\nCons: There's no cover charge, so the place is even more so infested with hoodlums. \\n\\nWhen our group walked in, we were immediately turned off by the music that was playing (hip-hop) and the plain, unattractive layout of the bar. The place was empty-ish, but after about 30 minutes a tidal wave of partiers entered. The place was so packed that we were constantly being bumped into. I had a mild panic attack as we were leaving because I had to squeeze, push, and fight my way through the dance floor to get out of the club and breathe some fresh air. Did I mention I'm slightly claustrophobic?\\n\\nVanguard is in a great location. It's located smack dab on the main Fremont drag next to Insert Coins and the Beat Coffeehouse. It's convenient to stop by if you're bar hopping along East Fremont, but the centralized location is pretty much the only positive thing about Vanguard. \\n\\nService at the bar was okay. We were served relatively quickly considering how busy it was. I ordered 4 Irish Trash Cans (A Long Island with Blue Curacao and Peach Schnapps). The total came to $48. I was peeved at the $12 a piece price tag, especially since the drinks were served in dinky little plastic cups. I mean, c'mon, I could go to the much classier Wayfarer bar across the street and pay the same amount for a drink that tasted and looked a million times better. \\n\\nThere's nothing going for Vanguard. I definitely won't come back. Everyone in my group thought the place sucked. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1 is that the bartenders were quick and they didn't hassle me about my Groupon.

Let me preface that I am from LA and have been eating my way through all the fusion food trucks when the craze started. You can say that I've had the standard, the grail to which I will judge all others heavily. Oh, and I know how to pickle, brine and kimchee with the best of them and I have done fusion tacos all my life being part of a blended family (filipino adobo tacos, ethiopian tibbs tacos, duck confit tacos, \\\"bahn mi\\\" tacos, BBQ pulled pork and beer slaw...yeah I go there with my food). \\n\\nEven if I didn't have \\\"experience\\\" in this food genre, there was something off about the food. Not trying to be the \\\"expert\\\" asshole, but just saying, I know what kimchee should be like and what is good fusion since that is my style of cooking. Though the kimchee had a right amount of spice to set off the food but not  be overwhelming for meek palettes, the flavor was off and was going in a sort've bitterish, weird flavor that threw off all of us. That is my main shtick is the fusion part of the taco was not good- that is not how kimchee is supposed to be. It can be savory, a bit sour, a bit salty/briny, but bitterish and odd flavor I can't place is a no go. Best way I can describe it is if you were to botch up or have a spoiled batch of kimchee. I had a bad jar once and later found it wasn't not only sealed loosely, but my dad ate pieces out of it with the spoon he was eating lunch with contaminating it hence the off fermented spoilt flavor. So the tacos are fairly big flour tortillas but it was mostly filled with lettuce. The pork was cubes, not the usual shredded, and was soft and juicy and nice on their own, but sparse. The Tofu Egg had a lot of tofu egg in the taco compared to the pork.. It was mashed tofu mixed with the egg and with the very wet kimchee made for a soggy texture that just wasn't working for me. Also, the wetness made it a bitchfit to even eat the tacos because they were stuck to the paper container and ripped holes into my taco so it was then a \\\"bowl\\\" instead of a taco. I think it needs a \\\"heavier\\\" fry to stand up to the wetness of the kimchee (I personally would do crispy/fried tofu cubes and shredded omelette instead of blended together) or drain the kimchee a bit better before putting on the taco to avoid a large amount of the sog factor. The BF left this Tofu&Egg alone after a few bites and that guy kept saying \\\"I'm soo hungry\\\" in the car after we decided to skip \\\"lunch\\\" at 1, go to errands and go eat later here at 4. Apparently not hungry enough to down his taco. \\n\\nFries were yummy- crispy, not greasy and a good amount of seasoning on them. Crazy dough was good- it was crispy and doughy and not greasy at all, but it definitely needed more sugar coating on it (I dipped them in honey at home). \\n\\nI think Vegas needs street food since every great city has great street vendors so I give kudos to anyone who wants to get into the food stand/truck culture and start this city off. For that, I gave it a very fair 3 stars (being VERY nice) and for the fact that my fries and dough were tasty. However, I can't just live off dough and fries alone as a meal and I'm afraid as the way the cards fall that's all I'll be ordering and only if I'm at Lee's already feeling like having a snack. They were doing some sort of promotional stuff at Lees and even had a Hanshik raffle so very well an \\\"event\\\" can boggle things up.  I will come back maybe in a few months and try one taco again to give it a fair chance, but as it stands it's something I hesitate ordering again. The BF does not want to go back, he says he was really disappointed.\\n\\n I was set to go to Blue Nile Ethiopian food for lunch, Crown bakery for dessert  and dinner at the Slider Truck then the BF got the idea to go to this instead to bring to his mom and grandma food who weren't feeling to well. Yeah, today I feel I got shafted out of a good eating day at three places to go to one place that didn't live to the hype....I was pretty pissed I starved part of the day to eat w/ the family instead at a place near them. I have to resurrect it myself by getting in my kitchen late tonight and doing up something Chef worthy. It might have been an off day for them and everyone can have that, but shit it made my seeming good day off. It wasn't their fault we chose to come at that day and time, but we expected something worth giving up my day for and that leaves me bitter as the kimchee.\n\nAnswer:",

I've been there twice and there were several old worn out bar patrons that probably occupy a stool every day.  That is the biggest turnoff for me  Once behind the door to the small restaurant, it's quirky to say the lest.  The service was very good and friendly.  The food was good and arrived quickly. i had a patty melt and it was delicious and juicy and served on marble rye.   I am a loss to figure out whey when there are so may choices in LV for restaurant and folks would choose to go to Four Kegs.  This confirms that there is a lid for every pot an it takes all kinds of places to make the world happy.

Had been searching for Thai Elephant because of yelp reviews, but gave up and got desperate and actually located Thai Rama.  The servers were all clearly ASU students and several were working on homework. We came in at a really random pre-dinner hour on a Sunday so we were the only people there, but that was alright.  Prices were reasonable, and service was obviously fast... however, I was deciding between the yellow and panang curry, chose the yellow eventually but was served the panang.  It's okay, though because it was truly delicious... but she didn't really listen to me.  My curry was substantially better than my friend's pad thai, which was very hot, as she requested (two-star \\\"thai hot\\\") but kind of had a strange flavor, different than other pad thai we have tasted.  It wasn't awful by any stretch, but paled in comparison to my awesome panang curry.  The flavor was second to none, and panang curry is one of my favorite comfort foods.  The restaurant itself wasn't special, though the ambiance wasn't too bad.  I'd come back for an inexpensive date night or to have a quick bite with my friends... not to impress any Thai connoisseurs, though.\n\nAnswer:",

The beer selection doesn't look all that extensive, though I suppose you'd like it if you're big into craft brews.  The food is somewhat pricey and from what I had, I could think of a few other places where I'd rather eat for the price I'm paying.  \\n\\nThen again, I'm weird and this is just me.

We went on opening day so there is room to grow but it was very well run for an opening day. \\n\\nCustard was good, but Rita's is better. Freddy's is more ice cream consistency and the flavor was refreshing though. It is piped down a long chute and is then scooped versus a softer serve style like they have at Rita's. The sundaes are pretty creative. Kids had the dirt and worms, brownie sundae, and their signature Turtle sundae. For me, I prefer to start out plain because if you can't get the basic, it doesn't matter what toppings you put on it. So, plain-Jane custard cone for me.

Thus, six months later I returned with friends and ordered a pork tenderloin sandwich. The waiter got busy and I could see the food in the window so long that they took the fries away and replaced them with another batch. Eventually, other waiters brought our food to us. The sandwich was good but the portion of pork seemed smaller and the fries were not as good as I remember.

The buffet is a lot smaller than before even with the items that are ordered from the kitchen. The filet, sea bass, lamb chops & lobster was lukewarm at best. The lobster didn't have any flavor & were tough (same as it was 4 years ago). The popovers probably would have been good had they at least been warm. The French toast was the hottest item from the stations & it was really good. I will give them 4 stars for the presentation but not the food or service. The wait was long to get plates cleared & he kept forgetting items from the kitchen or brought the wrong ones. The caviar is good & you definitely need to order a double amount since it comes from the kitchen (and in case you get a slow server like we did). I recommend the lobster Benedict from the kitchen. The king crab legs were very good albeit I had to use my napkin to hold onto them to crack them since the waiter kept forgetting to bring me the crackers. The rest was just ok.

Imagine my surprise to discover it was under new management (I should have read the recent reviews first). I was a fan of Kampai because it was possibly the most authentic Japanese restaurant in Phoenix.\\n\\nThe decor hasn't changed (which, frankly, could use some refreshing, like the seat cushions in the booths are sagging, but overall, is still quite serviceable and even charming), but the menu has changed radically and now includes an almost encyclopedic collection of \\\"maki\\\" sushi (sushi rolls), most of which seem be to calculated to appeal to western tastes. Think Philly and California rolls (along with Caterpillar rolls, Arizona rolls, etc.). Yes, you can still get sushi by the piece, but not sure if I'd bother, they didn't even have tamago (egg omelet) and the surf clam (both nigiri) we had fell apart. Perhaps they should stick with chirashizushi instead of nigiri. I also didn't think the sushi rice was well prepared or that the fish was properly chilled (it seemed a tad warm). I was not impressed.\\n\\nAlong with the sushi we also had a cucumber and seaweed salad (actually, sunomono) which was surprisingly good.\\n\\nCompliments, however, to the wait staff as they were exceedingly attentive and food and drinks were served with a smile and promptly. The staff is probably what stopped me from leaving too quickly (the staff under previous management was always warm and welcoming and I miss them).\\n\\nNow for the food coming out of the kitchen: Another delightful surprise, it was well executed. It was obvious to me that the tempura recipe was slightly different than previously, but it was well done and not greasy. A few details were off-putting, though, there was no gobo root in the vegetable mix and far too many slices of potato, and this time, pieces of chicken, too, which were a little stringy, I'd rather have had an additional shrimp (the large prawns were cut in half lengthwise and served in individually making the serving seem more generous than it was).\\n\\nAlso since the new management, the prices have risen rather steeply: Una-ju (eel over rice) is up sharply and several other items went up as well. Given recent economic times and the rise in restaurant prices, I'm not sure this is entirely fair, but some of the prices went up rather surprisingly high. It is easy, with drinks, to run to over $30.00 per person.\\n\\nThe new restaurant menu is all over the place: It appears that the new owners have tried to keep the core menu, but other additions make it seem disorganized, as if they are trying to please too many. The new menu has Fried rice, bulgogki, tempura, nabeyaki. Fried rice? And, yes, something like an encyclopedia of sushi rolls (2 pages worth).\\n\\nI went to Kampai because it reminded me of restaurants when I was in Japan. It was not striving for fusion or pan-Asain cuisine, or tons of novelty - a new dish now and then, fine, but was a solid example of quietly typical Japanese cuisine; quality classic food and an intimate atmosphere rather than catering to western ideas of what sushi and Japanese food \\\"should\\\" be or giving into food fads. I was always gratified to see members of the local ex-pat Japanese community eating there. And now I don't know where to sate my addiction to Japanese cuisine. Any recommendations greatly appreciated, as I don't know if I will be back to the new Kampai.\n\nAnswer:",

I took a seat at the bar and ordered a much needed coffee.  I decided to order the Biscuits and Gravy which, from what I was told, is one of the newer additions on their menu. Food came out promptly. It was a total of two in house baked biscuits and a mini pot filled with the gravy. My first thought was that the plating was different from what I've had at other places, but I did think the presentation was very nice. The gravy was very rich and thick. It seemed to have bacon in it. I'm not certain. Overall, it was a pleasing dish and the bartender was attentive and polite. I'll be coming back, but I plan on trying their dinner menu.\n\nAnswer:",

The restaurant is a very typical eat-in/take-out joint, with a nice lady coordinating the kitchen and taking the orders. As always, my order was the classic American-Chinese takeout standby of General Tso's Chicken. The food was ready in the promised 10 minutes, and I was happy to see that its container was practically bursting with chicken, broccoli, and fried rice. A good start!\\n\\nOnce home, I eagerly unloaded a mix of victuals onto a plate and began to chow down. Unfortunately, the experience from here on was a bit of a disappointment. The meat was not at all spicy (despite the cute little chili pepper next to its name on the menu), and the flavor was more bitter than I'm used to. Maybe that's what they're shooting for, but the peculiar bitter/salty aftertaste didn't jibe too well with my taste buds.\\n\\nGranted, my opinion here is based entirely on one experience with one style of food. That being said, I've definitely had better. I'll see how the leftovers are after a night of sitting in the fridge, but the next time I have a craving for the good general's fried nuggets of fowl, I'll probably be looking elsewhere.\n\nAnswer:",

I also had several coupons from Target for their food products, so I wanted to use them.  My first quest was to buy some grapes.  The coupon said $1.00 off for a pound or more.  I didn't see a container holding a pound of grapes,so I asked a young man who was working in that area and he said they didn't have pound containers, but they do have 2 pound containers.  I didn't want 2 pounds, plus of course, they cost more.  Okay, forget the grapes.  Then I got a 3 pound bag of apples, which was fine with the coupon for another dollar off.  I just sliced one of those apples this morning and the damn apple was brown inside.  It looked to me like all fruits are already packaged (I could be wrong), so you can't pick out what you want.  I was expecting cheaper prices, but with sales, I'm sure Fry's and other stores are about the same.  I know people who complain about Fry's produce, but I'm not going to, they are far better than Target.  The only good thing I can say about their new food area is that it is very neat and clean.

However the service was lacking quite a bit. \\n\\nFirst, when I got there I was the first to arrive out of my group, my event coordinator didn't get in that early and was not there to greet me or show me around, nor did anyone else bother to show me to the event room or how to get where I was going. I take that back, the girl at the front desk handed me a map and pointed me in a somewhat vague direction that didn't help much. I was told I would have easy access to the room to unload my car at, well without any employees to show me the access door I had to hoof my boxes from the parking lot around the building the long way. I did not find that back door until long after the seminar started. The room we were scheduled in was changed last minute for some reason, I believe  it has something to do with the final head count that we gave them. The room we ultimately in was a bit cramped for the number of attendees we had. \\n\\nI had to introduce myself to the catering manager and chef. No one came in to remove the places and trash from breakfast until almost 11 a.m. nor did they check on us. The boxed lunches weren't made right, only upsetting a few clients, but still.... I had to pop into the kitchen myself a few times and track someone down to help me. With the amount of money we were paying, it should have been perfect. For a cheap continental breakfast and a mediocor box lunch it was about $40 per head, kind of a lot. \\n\\nOver all my seminar went well at the hotel, but there were some behind the scenes issues that I really wish I did not have to deal with throughout the day.

I've been about half a dozen times now and I've had a consistently tasty product. They have various pre-made pizzas, and then they stick the slice(s) in the oven once ordered. Sounds cheap and \\\"not good,\\\" but let me tell you, IT'S GOOD. I love their flattened meatballs and their large pepperoni slices. Hell, it's all good. The crust is really what helps make this pizza way above average..crunchy yet a bit chewy and dusted with flour on the ends. Again..yum. Plain pieces of cheese pie run $4.50, and each topping is $0.50. My meat-lover's slice I had in December ran $6 but it was so worth it. \\n\\n\\nTIP: This place's peak hours tend to be when all the drunkies leave Marquee post 1 or 2 AM (uh...guilty). Be prepared to wait maybe even 30 minutes for that late night snack to soak up all of the alcohol you may have just imbibed in Marquee. \\nBeware: You want a soda?

Perhaps that added to the weird.\\n\\nThe front desk clerk was not very nice, I mean, technically, nice but the policies were pretty lame and she wasn't very polite about explaining them to us newbies.\\n\\nThey ask you to leave a deposit equal to somewhere in the range of $125 per day pre-charged on your credit card to be able to charge anything to your room and apparently, one of the promotions they were running with a free buffet a day was tied to this deposit.  Since we were there for 6 days that was TOO much money to have tied up in one place for us so we opted not to do that. It made getting the promotion a huge pain, the cashiers at the buffet had to call the front desk each time.\\n\\nI would have likely spent much more $ if that deposit wasn't so steep. We ended up paying as we went, which isn't good for them, that second $25 drink by the pool (granted, they're HUGE) would have seemed a lot easier to order if I was just signing a bill rather than pulling out cash or a card.\\n\\nThe rooms, however, were really nice and the beds are as comfy as previously reported. Shower set up is in front of a large soaking tub, with the sinks and mirror in front, toilet to the side behind another sliding glass door. Figuring out the remote is tricky for the first day, then it's fine.\\n\\nThe pool area is great though, just stay away from the one near liquid as it gets WAY TOO LOUD. I also found that by the weekend, it was too 'Jersey Shore' party central at the back pool for my liking, from about 11am and on, it was too crowded and trashy for me.\\n\\nThe rest of the hotel is fine and good, the decor is a bit manic, but the stand out employees were the bell staff and the pool security guy, both of them were AWESOME.\\n\\nStill, there was an additional charge of about $30/day to use the spa area - hot/cold pools and such- since we normally stay at the Red Rock and it's included in the daily 'resort charge' this seemed lame. There's still a resort charge of $20 a day but it's just a glorified tax, it's not like it's optional.\n\nAnswer:",

It wasn't THAT complicated of an alteration either and I'm not all that picky.  The dress had a 'sash' around the waist and when I had to get the dress hemmed, in turn the 'sash' needed to be brought up so it was the same length as the dress.  Despite 2 attempts to get this point across, the alteration was never made.  Additionally, the way the 'sash' hung in the back, when the dress got taken in on the sides the first time, nothing was done to adjust the 'sash' and then I had the thing hanging way to the left, almost on my side instead of hanging straight down my back.\\n\\nOk, maybe the 'sash' thing was complicated?  But beyond that issue, the hem was done terribly.  It was a tee length dress and the hem was done so poorly that it was 'bunched' weird in several locations so that it didn't lay flat.  Not to mention when I picked up the dress, there were still white fabric pencil marks all over the bottom of it where they marked the hem and never bothered to remove it when they were done.  \\n\\nI also specifically had to ask for the dress to be pressed when they were done.  I wouldn't have really expected to have to do this and i would not have cared that they didn't except that with the hem not done well, before pressing it it looked horrendous....at least pressing it helped to sort of make the hem lay flat.  \\n\\nBasically, I didn't feel like any of this was done well and even though the lady seemed a little embarrassed that her help didn't do a good job on this dress, she also didn't seem to care very much either.  She acted very annoyed that i needed additional alterations after the first attempt...when second alterations were mostly only necessary b/c of the bad job they did the first time.  \\n\\nMaybe this place is fine for simple stuff like hemming pants and the like, but i wouldn't trust a dress for a wedding with them again!\n\nAnswer:",

She could tell I was having a hard time making a decision and recommended the avocado eggs benedict. So I got it, even though I've never had that before and I love over-medium eggs. My partner got the chicken-fried steak. By the way, you order at the walk-up counter. \\n\\nWe got our drinks and sat down. The food came out really fast! The pancakes for my partner were going to take a bit they said, which was no problem. About two minutes later, a man told us they had to make the batter for the pancakes so it was just going to be a bit longer and asked if we'd like some biscuits while we waited. We said sure, and he brought out two small, hot biscuits. THEY WERE DELICIOUS! And surprisingly really filling! He also brought some strawberry jam too. I don't even LIKE jam and I thought it was so good! And seriously 5 minutes later they brought out the pancakes. Not a big deal at all to wait at most 5-7 minutes for a side when your main meal is already out. But to bring some complimentary and delicious biscuits? EXCELLENT customer service and attentiveness all the way around. \\n\\nThe chicken fried steak was really good and had some great flavor. The sauce especially had some nice seasoning to it. The hash browns were browned and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I personally would have liked them a bit more done, but it was no problem and really could be the difference of being cooked 30 more seconds. So, consider that my petty personal preference. Since I've never had eggs benedict before, I have nothing to gage my judgement against. So take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt: the first few bites were good. But after awhile, everything was a bit too soft and a bit too bland, even with salt and pepper. It makes sense; you have a smooth sauce, a poached egg (also my first one), a soft avocado, soft tomato slice, and an English muffin (evenly sliced and while warm, not toasted that I could tell.)  That's a lot of soft food with mellow flavors all at once. Not my favorite, but I could see how someone else would like it. Like I said, since it was my first one, I have nothing to compare. I ate about 1/2 of it, and since I had hash browns and that biscuit, you can see how I was full! Considering the chicken fried steak was delicious, I think it's just my preference that I didn't care for the eggs benedict. The only true compliant I'd have about it was that there was a bit too much hollandaise sauce. I would ask for half the amount. \\n\\nOverall we'd go back again, and try new things. They had some yummy sounding French toast and other solid breakfast staples.\n\nAnswer:",

After seeing the menu on the outside of the door, we were anxious to see if the food was as good as it sounded. \\n\\nOn first approach, the hostess was extremely pleasant and very kind. She sat us immediately at a booth along the wall. Our waitress, I think her name was Hayleigh, came to our table to take our drink order and my fiance and I both ordered drinks from the bar. I ordered the white sangria and he ordered a Manhattan. Our drinks took approximately 20 minutes to come to the table and when the server brought them out to the table, she made an excuse about the bartender being new and walked away. This did not bother us much except for the fact that we probably would have ordered 2nd drinks if they had not taken so long! \\nBefore she brought the drinks, the server asked if we were ready to order and seemed inconvenienced when I mentioned that we would like to order an appetizer. However, we ordered the mussels and they were really delicious. Our food came out before we were finished with the appetizer. I ordered the Lobster Rolls and my fiance ordered the RIbeye. My Lobster Rolls were delicious. i cannot express how much I loved them. Definitely a must try if you happen to want to try this place out. My fiance's ribeye was cooked well, however the potato wedges that came with it were cold and soggy. By this time, both of our waters have been empty for a good 15 minutes. Once we finally got our servers attention, she was annoyed when we explained to here that the wedges were cold.\\nDuring this time, the table in front of us was complaining to the manager about their food taking a long time, and the manager was a complete jerk about it to them. Both my fiance and I are servers and we have never witnessed worse customer service. The manager was rude and condescending and told the table that they were lying about their food taking a long time, and said \\\"What do you want me to do about it?\\\" \\nFor this reason, we chose not to speak with the manager because of how rude we saw him being. We then asked our server, who we have seen only 3 times all night to box up our food, because we just wanted to leave. \\n\\nWorst service I have ever experienced. I will never go back.

When we entered the restaurant lighting was very dim, there were some small private rooms to the right, and were only like 5 tables eating. I was waiting to try the Halibut with ratatouille, but unfortunately it wasn't on the menu. From that point I almost wanted to walk out and go to Fiamma Trattoria for their lobster and dumplings, but we were sooo glad we stayed. Furthermore, I figured almost all the restaurants in Vegas have shortened menus from what they have on line. For the price the food was remarkable, outstanding, very awesome. Yup you should definitely try this restaurant. The only down side was out waiter was standing very far away doing nothing....he didn't even refill our water. The other servers were much better than ours....it just depends on your luck. \\n\\nFood 5 stars \\n\\nComplimentary San Francisco Sourdough- The large loaf of bread was cut into large pieces and cooked in olive oil. My parents said it tasted great, but I was saving room for my entree. \\n\\n1. Chicken and dumplings- My dad was very bold to go for this item and he succeeded. He said it was the best piece of chicken he had ever tasted, and he talked about throughout the whole weekend. He said the chicken was very tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. It was flavored just to his liking. He even like the gnocchi which was surprising, because he usually doesn't. It even came with a small side of creamed broccoli and carrots which complimented the dish very well. \\n\\n2. Striped bass- Good thing I didn't get the same reaction as I would get when I eat sea bass. I always get a stomach discomfort every time I eat sea bass, so I was I glad I left with a happy tummy. The fish was cooked so soft and without a fishy smell there usually is in striped bass. It came with a side of beans which I usually hate, but now I love. I guess there is always a time to try something new. \\n\\n3. Salmon- It looked absolutely beautiful. It was a thick and square piece of fish and lightly pink in the center. It's texture was cooked perfectly and it wasn't rare. My mom cooks the best piece of salmon in the world and she said that it tasted great. Unfortunately I didn't get a bite. \\n\\n4. Brussels Sprouts- I wouldn't order this again the next time I come back. Way to much fatty bacon and oil in this dish. Good thing the entrees were very pleasant.\n\nAnswer:",

Just by chance I called the restaurant to see if we could arrive a half-hour earlier.  Much to my amazement and disappointment, the hostess informed me that something happened in the kitchen earlier that day and they were closed for the rest of the night.  I would think that for paying top dollar at an upscale restaurant, the least they could do is inform you of this prior to your arrival...clearly that was not the case and, in my opinion, unacceptable for a restaurant of their prestige.

All of the staff is friendly and interested in the dogs.  I had only scheduled one night, and our plans changed.  I called on the morning I was supposed to pick my dog up and asked if I could leave her a second night and they said that was fine.  It really opens up some spontaneity for me.  Also, I asked how my dog did the first night, and they said she did great, and based on their comments, it was obvious to me that they had checked in on my dog.\\n\\nThe dogs are kept in separate, large cages.  There was enough room that I was able to bring a travel crate and my dog's bed.  This worked well for my dog.  Lots of kennels that i checked out in the area have the dogs spend hours together in a playtime area.  But you never know how well the dogs will be supervised.  I liked that this place is not set up that way, my dog likes to feel safe in her own space.  That may not work for others, but it is a great setup for my dog.\\n\\nThey are up front with their prices and drop off/pick up times, so there were no surprises.

Unfortunately, the day we decided to go, we were in a bit of a rush. We thought getting a quick wrap or salad to go would be quick. Unfortunately, it took over 30 minutes to get three wraps to go.\\n\\nThe menu is a bit difficult to navigate as it is so wordy. Whoever wrote it felt an entire narrative on the execution of their dishes was necessary rather than just a breakdown of what was in it.\\n\\nI got their Teriyaki Wrap. It was OK, but definitely not worth the wait. The sauce it came with was advertised simply as a teriyaki sauce. They failed to mention the inclusion of a wasabi cream mixture placed in it, an unfortunate combination for those like me who do not enjoy the taste of wasabi or those who do not like spicy foods, especially if they are not warned of its existence. That was the worst error of all for me. This lost my trust in their menu and i will not be coming back.\\n\\n*Edit* After an owner/worker posted a comment, I realized I missed an important point. Had the restraunt been busy with lots of people in front of us, I could have understood the wait.

You can't beat the gorgeous layout with it's plush seating, high quality stripper poles, tall ceilings, state of the art lights, and large dance floor. I also love that in the warmer months, the club's back wall opens out onto the beautiful pool which comes complete with beds, tables, and private cabanas. Of course, the bars are huge and full of overpriced quality. The DJ is always top notch playing the best mixes. The go-go dancers are always hot and have the sexiest outfits on that I want to steal off their shaking bodies. \\n\\nNow granted I am a girl... er, woman (some might even say attractive woman), so I am able to get a lot of things that many people can't. Women, listen up: make friends with promoters to get you out of the ridiculously long line that starts at 10 o'clock and get you in for free. Actually, just make \\\"friends\\\" with anyone that can get you into the club without waiting whether it be promoters or rich married men who want to feel young standing next to you or Ryan Seacrest. It doesn't really matter! It's Vegas. Because XS is so big, you can ditch them once you're inside. It sounds harsh, but they know what's up. You're not obligated to hangout with a stranger just because they expedited your entrance... Please. Drinks on the other hand is a different story since like any club in Vegas, drink prices are more ridiculous than a strip club in New York! Make nice conversation and only have a drink if they give you the option. Don't bogart their $500 bottle otherwise you'll look like a lush and some other not so nice words. Men, just pray that you'll get in eventually and be prepared to stuff some Benjamins in somebody's pocket the rest of the night.\\n\\n\\nOn an interesting yet fun side note, I heard there's a $10,000 drink option at XS that comes with a cocktail and a strand of black pearls.

I got a more younger crowd vibe and there was an excessive amount of weed smell in hallways and elevators. The elevators were a NIGHTMARE. I am not exaggerating when I say we waited about 30 min for an elevator. There is a long line to get on and when the elevator passes your floor, it's already full. So I suggest a lower level. We ended up sneaking into the employee elevator because we were on the 12th floor and were carrying a lot of stuff. The rooms are decent but I did feel skeptical about sleeping under the covers. I suggest bringing also your own pillow case. We ran out of towels and housekeeping brought us some within 10 minutes. It doesn't have central AC but the one they have worked just fine.

It's a smaller store with less animals, but the ones they have looked healthier. The baby sulcatas especially looked to be much healthier. This is probably because there were less of them in a larger cage. They also had a couple baby monitors that were very cute. The bearded dragons also looked healthier and had better coloration.\\nOne last note; this store is in El Mirage, not Surprise, like one of their ads said and you cannot get to the store directly from Grand Ave. You have to pull off before you get to the store and drive around to it.\\n\\n*Edit\\nPratt's in Surprise has taken to keeping different species of animals in the same cage with each other. The last time I was in the store they had captive bred Sulcatas and Bearded Dragons in with wild caught Green Iguanas. Not only is this dangerous to the lizards, because they could injure each other, but the Iguanas could have parasites that could be transferred to the other CB lizards.

The unexpected touch was the amaranth seeds, which contributed a wonderful crunch that made this dish memorable. It was so tasty and refreshing that we contemplated a second order.\\n\\nChilaquiles: These were not the casserole-style chilaquiles I am used to, but it was a welcome difference.

I understand that it costs a restaurant a fair amount to obtain that many different vegetables, and I certainly don't mind paying for that...but this dish just had no punch! Many of the vegetables were indistinguishable from one another, and the dominant taste was soy sauce. It was beautiful to look at, but that's the best I can say. I much prefer the $6 fried rice I can get at my favorite sushi place back home.\\n\\nTacos: The tacos, unfortunately, were a miss. The chicharron didn't bring anything to the party on my Cochinita taco, and I didn't care for the aftertaste either.\\n\\nBottom line -- China Poblano is worth a visit for the ambience and certain dishes, but you can definitely skip the tacos.

I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and decor, but the food was lacking. It seems like I remember it being much better in the past, but now it's completely forgettable. \\n\\nWe had the Nachos as an appetizer, which were good - how do you mess up nachos? I had the coconut shrimp, which was overcooked. The dipping sauce was supposed to be guacamole based, but it tasted mostly like sour cream so I skipped it. The veggies as the side order came out colder than the rest of the food, and were limp and mushy. The seasoning was overbearing, as all the flavor had been cooked out of the vegetables. One person had the cheeseburger, which they said was delicious, loaded with greens, and cooked perfectly to her order. Another person had the fish and chips, and the fish was over cooked and chewy. Both of them raved about the french fries. Another person had the catfish, which was over salted. It was served with rice, and for some reason I guess we were expecting white rice - but it came out with Mexican style fried rice - which just threw us off, I suppose. The menu just said \\\"rice,\\\" though, so who knows. She had the same complaint about the veggies as I did. The last person order the Enchiladas Two Ways, which actually comes with three enchiladas. He said they were okay but nothing very special. \\n\\nIt seems like they've trimmed their menu as I remember more items in the past - and they were delicious. Maybe they are focusing more on \\\"bar food\\\" type items, which is fine, but even those weren't executed very well. We all left full, but not satisfied. The service was mediocre...she was pleasant, but did the bare minimum to get by. The place wasn't that busy so I'm surprised she wasn't a little more attentive. \\n\\nI've been there later at night when it's a bar scene, and it's fine. Once again, nothing special.

I can say that Delica Bistro does have a European feel to it, especially the pastries. I had a delicious croissant made with orange, sesame and Thyme that was just delicious and the sampler shortbread cookie I tried, wonderful! As for the coffee beverages, I had a double espresso for $2.50 (quite reasonable), made with Lilly coffee, which seems to be the Euro brand of coffee. My neighbors, also along for a local bike jaunt, had crepes, that were just lovely! I strongly recommend you check this place out and due to its location by the area off Mill near the AMC Centerpoint theaters, feels like you are on a piazza. \\n\\nBe advised they just opened and are still working out some operational bugs. My friends crepes took a bit of time but someone came over and apologized so they know they need to work some things out (they also came by a short time later with the option to sample a shortbread cookie so de nada). I did get my espresso in a small paper cup and hopefully there is  the option to also get it in a small cup. I do like that there are free cups for water for the taking at the register when you pay for your food and other drinks. They are also supposed to have baguettes available for purchase - a bit on the high end at $3 but hey, a Euro style bakery option in walking distance of my house so I'm not complaining.\\n\\nIt also feels strange that their espresso does not come with a side of sugar so if you want it sweeter, get it off the side area (though they only had non-sugar substitutes when I was there but once again, newly opened). I'll be there at least once a week for a morning pastry and coffee drink so I'll see them work it out.\\n\\nThe one thing I hope they are working on is a liquor license as it is a shame not to sit out on the patio, near the piazza style area with a nice bottle of wine and maybe, if someone from there is reading this, until then they will provide a BYOB option with a corkage fee?  \\n\\nOther than that, a lovely place that I think will only grow in popularity and its nice to come back from Europe and find a little slice of Euro style living, right in my own backyard - Viva la Delice Bistro!\\n\\nUpdate - went back today - service is still a work in progress as the owner works on developing the operational flow for the place but I did buy a whole grain baguette and it was amazing - little poppy seeds throughout that added a wonderful nutty flavor and the crust was chewy and crisp - I will definately buy them on a regular basis.\n\nAnswer:",

Terry, the owner, mixes solutions to create the perfect golden color for your own skin tone. I don't like to tan in the beds or out in the sun, so this is the best alternative. People constantly compliment me on my tan and are so surprised when I tell them it's a spray. It's the closet thing to a real golden glow and it's much better for your skin. The spray lasts about a week, so once it begins to fade, I scrub as much as I can off, and get another. I get a spray every week & I am completely satisfied with the results every time! I typically get a spray at night, so I can sleep on it and take a shower the next morning. The spray smells a little, but I would rather have a light scent than wrinkly skin when I'm older.

Rising over 1,200 feet from the valley floor in a short 1.2 miles you can experience a strenuous and difficult hike without driving to a national forest. The views are fantastic as you ascend, and the views at top are second to none. You can see 360 degrees with nothing higher from many miles in all directions.\\n\\nSo why only four stars? It is not the mountain that is a problem - it is the park service and the community. They work together to make the trails as difficult as possible to access. The Echo Canyon trailhead has a parking lot but it is very often full, especially on the weekends. If you can get a spot there you will not find legal parking anywhere in the surrounding neighborhood as they have restricted all street parking to prevent hikers from parking in the area. You will have to park over a mile away.\\n\\nThe Cholla Trailhead is much worse. There is no parking and it is illegal to even drop hikers off. You will have to park over a mile away and walk to the trail. If you have a bike you can ride your bike to the trailhead.\\nGreat hike! Parking sucks!\n\nAnswer:",

I went in yesterday with a friend to finally try their ice cream and after asking for the manager all of the girls working were staring at me and gossiping. I sampled the red velvet, coffee fudge almond, salted caramel, and peanut butter cup. All of the flavors were under developed and a few didn't taste like the flavor advertised. The red velvet ice cream was basically an icy vanilla ice cream with red velvet cake sprinkled on top. I was expecting cream cheese ice cream with red velvet cake mixed inside or some type of rendition of a red velvet cupcake. The coffee almond fudge ice cream tasted like a very strong coffee with no hint of fudge or almond. Salted caramel was the best of the 4 but it was too sweet. We didn't want any of the ice cream but the cookies in the display case looked good so we ordered the snickerdoodle cookie. Instead of taking the cookie out of the case, the girl working took out a prepackaged cookie from below. The cookie was hard as a rock and was much smaller than the one in the display case. Everything about the cookie was suspicious so I returned the cookie and when I was getting my money back I saw ants crawling on the floor. I told the male manager at the register and he says \\\" thanks, I know\\\" with an attitude. If you know, why aren't the ants being cleaned up off the floor? Sprinkles Cupcakes employees are extremely rude and the ice cream is sub par. I will never step foot in this location again.\n\nAnswer:",

Came for lunch and was very disappointed. Our service was awful. There were about 4 other tables in the place when we got there. We were seated and then we waited....and waited. Multiple staff members walked by us, other tables were being helped but not ours, manager was at the bar watching tv, for 10 minutes we continued to wait. Our less than stellar waiter finally showed up. He took our order, delivered it missing items, disappeared for 10 min at a time and overall made us feel like we were bothering him. He didn't once ask if things were ok, if we needed anything further etc. Pretty crappy for a lunch that requires additional small orders for the ayce sushi. The tables around us, all with waitresses, were being attended to politely and in a timely matter which only made it more apparent how much our service was lacking. As for the food...wasn't very impressed with that either. The spring rolls and garlic noodles were nothing i hadn't had elsewhere. The sushi was okay.\\nAlso, has anyone else seen the bathroom in this place? The hallway to it smells like piss, the sink is hanging off the wall and the furnishings include busted ikea furniture.

Hyperbole inducing spasms may commence from those who insist their spot is better.  Maybe you're right, so, let me try to convince you:\\n\\nTwelve wings is a MEAL here.  They provide equal amount of wings and legs, which are sized bigger than what you find at your typical spots, even those that specialize in wings, like say, Famous Wings.  We tried the Spicy Garlic.  Pretty typical selection, but these wings had fresh (browned) minced garlic actually sprinkled ON TOP of them.  They were spicy, but not palette wrecking or over-the-top as a method of proving their wings are the hottest around.  You actually want to finish these, which I find pretty rare for me because usually I'm just wishing for the pain to end.\\n\\nWe also ordered the \\\"chips and salsa\\\".  When ordering these, something pretty unusual occurred.  The bar manager (who is a 5-star, all around GREAT guy himself) actually called out for his chef to \\\"start some chips and salsa\\\".  When was the last time you heard someone request to \\\"start\\\" some chips and salsa.  I was eager to discover what he meant by that.  Five minutes later, we were graced be FRESHLY MADE in-house tortilla chips with light (and delicious) seasoning in a smoky and firey house salsa.  It was perfect, and worthy of a class Mexican restaurant.  \\n\\nSpokes, as it turns out, is actually more of a bar than a restaurant despite its flare for the amazing presented on its menu.  They have very cool and unique selection of beer.  I had two pints of Drop Top Ale and my gf had a Moose Drool and finished with the Drop Top as well.  The manager also mentioned that he replaced his Guinness tap with Strong Arm Stout because it tasted much like the grandaddy of all stouts, was more interesting, and well, had an awesome pull tap.  I agreed.\\n\\nSpokes has a full bar with an experienced bartender making them.  Today, they had a specialty drink with Madori, Captain's, Malibu, and pineapple juice for like $3.  He also mentioned several themed nights if you're into that.  Personally, I'm not, but its a superb place to day drink on a Sunday after hiking South Mountain.  This place picks up a lot of that, as well as cyclers, hence its name.\\n\\nThe experience was awesome and its cool to find a local Valley bar that hits all the right notes, including the previously mentioned manager/bartender.  He was probably the friendliest and most helpful I've experienced in the Valley.  He also insisted we sample different beers before we made a decision.  All class.  \\n\\nJust when you think it couldn't possibly be more charming, he discounts our tab 30% to commemorate his favorite holiday, and pointed to his Marley tee-shirt.  Just one cool f'n dude.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place, especially if ya wanna get out of your neighborhood for a pint and wings.\n\nAnswer:",

I finally asked the not so nice lady about where I could find a comb...annoyed by my apparently dumb question she pointed to the box on the counter that I guess sanitizes 3 brushes for reuse....The brushes had hair on them still and well it was a hard decision to figure out whether or not I wanted my hair knotted in a ball or brushed to look somewhat decent...\\n\\nThe seating was uncomfortable, but if your tired enough I guess you can nap as one woman did...lol and the water dispenser was broken so they provided bottled water for you.

I got food poising from eating the Italian wedding soup. It was the first time that I had ever eaten it, and I decided to try something new. I didn't get to eat my eggplant Parmesan which is what I normally order cause I got full off of the soup.  I work on call and got called into work. I left the restaurant around 4 pm. I arrived at work around 7pm. My stomach started bothering about 30 minutes before, but I didn't feel totally bad so I went to start my shift. around 7:15 pm I started throwing up and didn't stop until the ambulance showed up at my job and gave me anti nausea meds in an IV. \\n\\nThe next day I called the restaurant to report what happened. I call to speak with the manager after spending the night in the hospital to voice what happened and my first call was ill received by the waitress that took my first message. After I called three days later to speak with the manager. I got blown off saying that they would have the owners contact me and they never returned my call. Since I wasn't insured. I missed a night of work. The hospital and ambulance is billing me for $5000. Needless to say I will not be eating there again. \\n\\nBut since no one that we know of reported getting sick but me. It was an isolated incident, and one I won't forget. What I was hoping for was an apology, and at least an offer to find out what happened. They didn't even ask if I were alright, and if I had any info from the hospital on what happened, and if they should be concerned.\n\nAnswer:",

Come here for a bowl of hot pho, not for a local dining experience.\\n\\nWaiters legitimately do not want to talk at all. A guy came by to take our orders and asked if we were ready, then proceeded to not mutter another word even when he didn't understand what we wanted. He managed to mime out hand signals that let us know to clarify what number or order we wanted. Mind you, the guy speaks English very well. When he returned with our food, we asked him to remove appetizer plates and he literally froze for a second before turning around to walk away without muttering anything at all. Then, when I was standing in line to pay, another waiter decides to take a shortcut between me and the guy in front of me and steps on my shoes without apologizing at all. I was the last person in line at the cashier and there was plenty of space behind me and only a narrow gap in front of me.\\n\\nSome of the best local restaurants in Phoenix thrive because they offer a great customer experience along with their great food. Pho Thanh fails horribly at offering any customer experience. Each customer is simply another $6 bowl of pho that needs to be moved along promptly. I would've gave them 3 stars if their Pho was good but it was not as good as in the past. The beef felt tough and noodles did not seem fresh. I've had better from them before but I always prefer Da Vang. \\n\\nFor having to put up with shitty staff and get barely above average Pho noodles makes me not want to return here.\n\nAnswer:",

Bar Marco has a cool, laid back vibe.  I loved the feel inside with the brick walls and beautiful ceiling.  We started with their bread basket appetizer.  The bread come out warm and wonderful.  The strawberry jam that came with it was so yummy!  There were 4 kinds of bread and all were delightful.  I chose the Rosemary French Toast - WOW!  I also got a side of grits.  The grits were seriosly seasoned to perfection and they were the perfect consistancy.  The hubby got the grits too and LOVED them as well.  He chose the buttermilk pancakes for his dish.  They were delightful as well...light and fluffy perfect.  And the bacon that came with them, great maple flavor!  I had a cocktail because I read the reviews and it looked as though everyone noted the cockails are terrific.  I chose the Blue Moon and it was light and delicious!  All in all Bar Marco is a wonderful little place with a cool vibe, wonderful food, and terrific cocktails!\n\nAnswer:",

It was seafood night.\\n\\nFortunately enough, my aunt went there first and waited in line.  By the time we walked in, she had already gotten us the table.  As you walk into the Buffet, the lighting is a bit dim and dark.  However, you can see and navigate.  The atmosphere is laid out like a safari or jungle.  Imagine the RainForest restaurant with no animals.  Unless, you think the large buffet people are hippos, elephants, or tigers grazing on the buffets...hee hee...\\n\\nThe wait staff was not that great.  For some reason, it looked like the casino has cut back on staff.  As a result, the service was a bit too slow for my taste.  Also, some of the utensils (i.e. crab breakers/nut crackers) were not available.  Need to stock up people!\\n\\nAs for the food, I headed straight to the king crab claws and was sorely disappointed, they were a bit frail and thin.  boo hoo... shrimp was okay... and I don't want to really talk about the oysters.  Let's say this, one look at the oysters and I had to sadly walk away.  It was puny and a bit too old for me.  \\n\\nOn the flip side, they had a great pasta layout.  But, it was the various \\\"creole\\\" sauce that stood out for me.  They had a clam sauce, a shrimp etoufee creole sauce, and another light creole flavor sauce.  It was pretty good.  The salad bar was okay.  However, the desserts and the fruits were very sweet and good.\\n\\nOverall, the price per person is about $18 on seafood night.

Between you and me day drinking isn't one of my strong suits and has to be justified for me to do it.\\n\\nA great happy hour not only starts early but allows you enjoy well priced libations and food at great prices. That's when great happy hour specials come into play, such as at the recently discovered 5th and Wine in Old Town Scottsdale. Opened by the same owners as the fantastic Humble Pie and the new Living Room Wine Bar in Chandler, they create a space that's welcoming, relaxed and comfortable. Service is polished with an attractive and eager staff that seem genuine and friendly.\\n\\nDay drinkers can delight from 3pm-7pm daily, including weekends, with 5th & Wines great happy hour with glasses of wine priced at $5. The deals don't stop there, also offering a short list of fantastic draft beers and well drinks both at only $4.\\n\\n5th and Wine also offers several well priced appetizers to pair up with one of their amazing wines. Salty cured meats always taste so good while sipping drinks, and the Prosciutto Wrapped Breadsticks ($4) filled the ordered perfectly. They take long thin bread sticks then wrap them with thin slices of cured pork and finish them horseradish cream, incredibly addictive.\\n\\nServed with crunchy jicama and ranch dressing for dipping, the Spicy Chicken Drumettes ($4) might be the best deal on the menu. In total there were 12 plump and meaty drumettes that were cooked until tender then slathered in a spicy vinegary wing sauce, basic I know but executed perfectly.\\n\\nThe center piece to all of the eating and drinking were definitely the Bruschetta ($9.95 for 6). Starting with a thick slab of toasted artisan bread, you choose from 8 different preparations ranging from mild to sublime. Standouts included a tasty peppercorn crusted steak with dollops of nose clearing creamy horseradish and for the wine centric, apples with brie and fig jam which was then drizzled with honey and agave syrup. After trying so many, my absolute favorite had prosciutto, mascarpone cheese, figs and tomato jam. Salty, sweet, creamy and chewy, this touched on everything I love about well prepared Bruschetta.\\n\\nAt these prices you can easily put together a hearty meal but why stop there? 5th and Wine also offers a great selection of salads, sandwiches entrees and daily specials on their regular menu.\\n\\nNot to be missed, the 5th and Wine Burger ($11.95) starts with all natural ground beef then is topped with Cambozola or White Cheddar, caramelized onions and organic arugula. I opted for the addition of an organic fried egg for only $1.50 more which added the creaminess of hot egg yolk to each beefy bite. Almost as good as the burger, the 5th Ave Sausage ($10.95) uses Schreiner's sausage, caramelized onions, roasted peppers, arugula and whole grain mustard on toasted focaccia. However on my last visit, like the burger, the sausage was served on tender flaky brioche, a perfect substitute.\\n\\nJust think in the time it took to read this another happy hour started.\n\nAnswer:",

I pretty much go there to buy a few necessities and a 12 pack of soda or what have you and pretty much every time I leave hating that place even more. First off, the parking lot is a total clusterf*ck. The front of that store is a damn near death trap. There's always a ton of people trying to cross the one lane in front of the store that's barely two cars wide. Then you always have cart collectors pushing carts everywhere and even if they have full time cart gatherers, there's always carts EVERYWHERE! \\n\\n   I think this is the oldest and smallest Wal-Mart in Las Vegas and it pretty much shows. I think the population has since exploded from the time this place opened to now, and this store is not equipped for it. Plus this area is pretty ghetto and there's always a few bums standing in front of the store asking for change and there's always that one family with 5 kids that make going to Wal-Mart a field trip and clog up the already congested aisles.  \\n\\n   The selection here is pretty basic. They don't have a full grocery section so you're pretty much left with all packaged stuff like chips, sodas, breads, canned stuff and cereals. The electronics section is pretty basic also. The got a wall of tvs, a small case of 3 laptops they might be stocking, three or four cases for the games, one aisle of dvds, and they don't seem to have a designated blu-ray section. The only Blu-Rays are usually in a display stand outside of the electronic section. Clothing, men's clothing to be exact, is pretty bad. They pretty much have a few basics like khakis, polo shirts, and some athletic stuff but that's pretty much it. I remember I wanted to buy some wife beaters once and I went to the section and couldn't figure out whether or not they even carried them. I remember it looked like there was some Haynes display and they broke that down and just threw them on a shelf with no prices or anything.  \\n\\n   I usually try to go to the self-checkout when I'm there but those usually take as long as going to a regular line. It usually because people freakin' try to ring up 75 items at the damn self-check, and half the time people don't know how to use the damn machine. \\n\\n   Customer service is non-existent, but it's Wal-Mart and you should expect that by now. If you want to go to a Wal-Mart, go to any one but this one. Really, the only people that go to this one are people that live near by it like myself.\n\nAnswer:",

It amazes me how a night can be going so well and how you can rate your experience very highly in your head until in one split second the manager ruins it all for you.\\n\\nUnfortunately that was our experience here.\\n\\nI had plans to come to Deville with a few girlfriends last week and was so excited to try it out because the reviews looked great.\\n\\nWe were seated, and right away you could feel a funky vibe from the diner with bright purple lights and cool oldschool booths lining the space. After looking at the menus, we were told that the mango mojitos were the special of the day so we went with those and they were pretty good.\\n\\nWe then ordered our mains (I had the Adam's Ribs) and received our food in under 20 minutes. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious, the cornbread sweet but well made, and the coleslaw was good too (not too smothered in mayo). I wasn't a fan of the matchstick fries, but that's just me.\\n\\nOthers at my table also really enjoyed their food and overall experience.\\n\\nOnce we finished dinner, we asked to see a dessert menu and were approached maybe 5 times by our server asking if we had made a decision. This was a little bit annoying because he was hovering but even then, I wasn't mentally taking any stars away from my review. We ordered the apple pie ice cream sandwich to share which was also very very well made.\\n\\nBy that point, we had been at the diner for about two hours to 2.5 hours and had been chatting as most people do (9:30pm on a Thursday). We paid around that time also and proceeded to continue our conversation. Around 10, the manager came to our table pretty much kicking us out saying that she had reserved our table for another couple who had been waiting over 35 minutes for us to leave, and that she could seat us in a corner (our booth had access to the TV) because they wanted to watch the game, or we could just leave.\\n\\nNow you can imagine our disdain....no one had said anything to us about our table being reserved. We were paying customers who didn't really overstay their welcome in terms of going out for dinner, drinks, and dessert. And you can't just kick people out because they've paid their bill and now someone else wants our particular table (which was nothing special by the way).\\n\\nSo, as you can imagine, the three of us left with a very bad taste in our mouths, and although I was really excited to bring other friends and family to try out the food here, it's safe to say that I will definitely not be back. There are tons of delicious options in Montreal with excellent service as I've mentioned before in another review or two. Bad service or being spoken to as we were for no reason is really not acceptable in a city where competitors are a dime a dozen.\\n\\nBut to those of you reading to see if the food is good, it is. The service was quick and the decor is well done. Before the manager came over, I was planning on a 4 star review, but two stars removed for this unneccesary action on her part........\n\nAnswer:",

It has been too long to compare Tana's food to Abay's, but it was absolutely delicious.  We each got a sampler (one meat and one veg) and shared.  The service was excellent - our waiter was very friendly, attentive, and gave tasty recommendations.  We came in around 6 on a Weds and didn't wait at all.  The neighborhood isn't my favorite, but we were both able to park right out front which was nice.  The reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the location and the prices.

The food has been consistently good each time, and the service, consistently awful.  Our visit began today with the hostess telling us we would have a few minutes wait.  When she finally led us into the dining room (only about half full), she brought us to a dirty table, then realized it was dirty and walked us back out of the dining room.  Even though there were so many other open tables.  Okay, mistakes happen.  They clear the table and we finally sit down.  The server greets us several minutes later, and we order coffee.  Several minutes later, it arrives.  Warm, not hot.  We order crepes to share.  Many minutes later, the crepes come.  They are good, but covered in what seems to be canned whipped cream (the ridges in the cream kind of give it away.  I could be wrong, but that was our perception).  Server returns, asks if we would like to order anything else.  We do, as well as order more coffee.  Then he clears the main plate, but not our sharing plates or dirty silver.  Coffee takes even longer to arrive this time and is cooler than before.  Second course seems to take eons.  Server never checks on us.  Eggs Benedict is good, not great, and the potatoes that accompany taste like they were made at 11 am and held on a buffet for 3 hours.  Getting the check takes forever, but by now I am not surprised.  George's has atmosphere, and very good (not great, food) but repeatedly absent service has finally turned me off for good.

We had a 2 hour wait but you can leave and they'll text you when the table is ready.\\n If you have the casino members card, you get $1 off each menu item. So while you're waiting for your table, go get the players card. \\n\\nThe restaurant doesn't have tables for groups larger than about 4 so you would have to split up. We had a group of 7 but they sat us in a area about right next to reach other.\\n\\nCustomer service was spot on. Very friendly and informative waiters. \\n\\nHere was what we ordered:\\nShake #4 creme brulee pudding + Oreo shake + Oreo cookie = best shake ever!!!! LOVED IT since I love both of those, this was a perfect combo! The drink isn't super thick and milky surprisingly but more creamy. I couldn't stop drinking it. It actually made me full from eating my burger lol.\\n\\nHoney pig bao buns - roasted pork belly, pickled cucumber and radish, cilantro and honey hoisin sauce. It was good but I did wish the roasted pork belly was crunchy. It was soft though. The bun was very moist and soft. Overall, I liked it because of the pickled toppings that went with it. \\n\\nFarm burger- duck breast bacon cheddar and fried egg. This was one of the best burger I have had in a long time! They egg yolk was perfectly cooked to how I like it, runny. The duck breast bacon was good but a little too salty but still good. The hamburger buns were very fluffy and compliment the burger meat well. It did not overwhelm the burger. \\n\\nMy husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was very spicy but he loved it. The avocado was delicious with the burger. Meat was juicy and the burger was very flavorful. The bun on this burger was the same as the farm burger. Fluffy and went well with the burger.\\n\\nMy siblings got the Hog Burger and enjoyed it very much so. Juicy, cooked to perfection of medium rare with the awesome bun. \\n\\nWe would all come back here again next time. Totally worth your money!\n\nAnswer:",

But the worst part was my husbands sandwich bun was moldy, it was a couple patches, but enough for someone paying attention to see. This happened a couple of months ago.

You could be so great, but you lack a lot of the pizzazz that your Vegas club-siblings possess.  Like size, style and oh, I don't know, non-skeevy people?\\n\\nAfter a rough night at Pure, we decided to check out Sunday night at Moon.  I walked in and thought, \\\"Eh.  I've seen better.\\\"  I was surprised to Moon was so small!  The dance floor is pitifully tiny.  Most definitely not enough space to accommodate a Vegas-sized crowd. With only 2 bars and a handful of bottle service tables, Moon didn't strike me as a very high-class establishment.\\n\\nBecause Moon is located at the top of the Palms' Fantasy Tower, the entire roof opens up so club-goers get a burst of fresh air throughout the night.  Good in theory, but because the 2nd floor of the club is VIP-only, the regular folks get the poor-man's view.  Boo-hiss!\\n \\nI also had an issue with the music.  It was SO gangster.  I'm a hip-hop fan, too, but honestly, this was pretty hardcore.  It didn't have a great beat, was hard to dance to (especially when you've landed a cute Navy cop!) and didn't exactly have the crowd going crazy.  When the DJ switched to Tupac and Snoop, things took a turn for the better!\\n\\nFinally, the clientele isn't the greatest.  Maybe because the Palms is off the strip, or maybe because the Real World filmed there however many years ago, but something is kind of tragic about the folks that hang out here.  It's like being in a suburban club when you live in the city... Or maybe I'm just snobby.  =)\n\nAnswer:",

Place was packed and parking insane!! The parking was unbelievable. Stereotypes fit here. Fast, not courteous, not confident driving dare devils with attitude. After a 15 minute wait was seated in a dirty table, and after another 5 minutes was cleaned and the rice and noodle pieces left on the table top just thrown on dirty floor and seat. The place is not clean by outward appearance, but an A is in the window so hopefully the kitchen is. The restaurant is tiny, old and worn. The place appears to be beat up from all the traffic. Had KungPao chicken on recommendation from the hostess who was very nice. It was good, nothing amazing. The rice included rib, shrimp and chicken. It was delicious.

We had these in TJ, and they taste pretty much the same, so authentic!  In TJ, they make their horchata from scratch though...not here :(\\n\\nAnyways, if you have never been, one word : ADOBADA.  Adobada is a marinated pork awesomeness that is fire grilled on a rotisserie like setup.  This is why this place is awesome, so if you come here, you owe it to yourself to try it.  Try it MULAS style, which is essentially a taco, but with another tortilla on top with cheese in the middle...quesadilla style.  Try it on the fries...can't go wrong....it is awesome.\\n\\nBesides that, I have tried some of the others...the beef head and regular asada is great, but it doesn't shine a light to the adobada imo.\\n\\nBesides the flavor, you can't beat the price.  Tacos start at $2, and although you will need a few to fill you up, I find it difficult to believe you will find anything this good to eat 24-7 especially on the strip.\\n\\nThey just expanded, so it is much easier to find a seat and the lines are shorter...but still be prepared to wait a bit to order.\\n\\nGo see for yourself!\n\nAnswer:",

That being said, the food/ service was a little haphazard. \\n\\nI ordered the combination pho and it came out very quickly.  In my mind pho is all about the broth. Broth is a make or break thing and a good pho will have those amazing multiple layers of anise, coriander, fish sauce etc. this broth was missing something. Couldn't put my finger on it, but the broth did not have the flavor explosion I am accustomed to in pho. I wasn't bad per se, but I've had waaaay better pho. Bland. \\n\\nThe service on the other hand was terrible. I almost walked out of the restaurant because the server helped two other tables that came in after me and still had me sit there for 5 minutes after. He failed to bring out my spring rolls and then hassled me when I asked to have my nonexistent spring rolls removed from the bill. \\n\\nKudos for them being open 24/7, but there are at least 5 better pho joints with .5 miles.

I went with Vegas Ticket Fix because they had an ad and the fee was cheap. However when I got my letter from them I had to pay the fine AND I have to go to traffic school! WHAT?

I was given a voucher to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn free of charge. My stay was pleasant enough (the only reason why I think the hotel deserves 2 stars) - the rooms were nice and the breakfast was acceptable. When checking out, I was assured multiple times that my card would not be charged for the room because the voucher explicitly stated US Airways would be billed directly. \\n\\nAbout 3 weeks later, I see that, of course, I'd been billed for a night's stay at the hotel. I promptly called customer service, who couldn't even find my name/reservation and insisted that I provide my reservation # and receipt (neither of which I saved, since I didn't think there would be a need to save it for almost a month). They couldn't find my name in the database for 30 minutes and, after being transferred to another less inadequate rep, was told the charge was done in error and would be reversed. \\n\\nIt was reversed a week later, but then sure enough, 3 days after that I was charged for the hotel again. I then called customer service a second time and spent about 30 minutes convincing the rep to reverse the charge. They assured me that yes, I should not have been liable and they didn't know why I was charged again. They said I would be refunded again within 3 days. 12 days later, I had yet to receive a refund and I emailed customer service to follow up for a THIRD TIME, fully explaining the situation. A few days later I receive an email from customer service saying that the hotel in question refuses to reverse the charges (despite the fact that the hotel itself ASSURED me I would not have to pay). They didn't give any explanation for why they wouldn't reverse the charges. \\n\\nThe email provided me with the phone number of the general manager, Ken Hammac, saying to contact him with questions. I called him a few days afterward in mid-August and left him a voicemail explaining the situation, asking him to call me back. A month later, I had heard nothing from him. I called him for a second time last Tuesday (it's now Sunday) to follow up and have still heard nothing from him (ironically, his voicemail says \\\"we speak success\\\" - as much as I want to believe him, I must beg to differ). \\n\\nThe fact that I've had to reach out FIVE times over the course of 3.5 months to be refunded for a hotel I never should have had to pay for is absolutely unacceptable. I would go as far as to say this is the worst customer service experience I've ever had in my life. I have never been so disappointed with a hotel and will do everything in my power to avoid staying at Hiltons in the future. If you represent the hotel and have any questions, please reach out to me and I would be happy to discuss. \\n\\n-Adam\n\nAnswer:",

Like most people, I love to have that first cup of coffee in the morning to get me going. But I also like to have a cup in the evening sometimes as well. We are not limited to the same old coffee flavors anymore; in recent years there has been a real jump in the numbers and kinds of flavored coffees available. I think that the best selection of flavored coffee can be found at Starbucks, which has become one of the best-known coffee brands in the United States. Of course, their reputation was built on their quaint little coffee shops. Unfortunately, these shops are limited in number, and many of us have to settle for a tiny coffee bar in our local Barnes and Noble store. The company has recognized the value of its' brand, and has branched out by selling their product at major grocery stores and on the Internet. Starbucks online is a nifty place to shop for this unique Seattle product, whether for yourself or for gifts. \\ni really enjoy going to this Starbucks. The barista women there were so friendly and they definitely acted like they actually cared about how my day was going. We had casual chit chat ask where i am from and the service was very quick and above average. The drink mocha frap no whip was prepared exactly like i asked.\n\nAnswer:",

I had no problem getting and staying at the front, even after leaving to get a drink, but the dance floor was packed and everyone was having a blast!

I'm almost afraid to write this because I don't want this place getting too crowded (for selfish reasons), but I also want it to stick around because it's some of the best BBQ in Phoenix and one of my favorite places. \\nAll the BBQ is quality and Tuck matches it's sauces with the type of meat to create the perfect marriage of sauce and smoky meat goodness. The Turkey Breast, as mentioned by the Phoenix New Times IS a stand-out, but mostly because of its uniqueness. Turkey isn't always seen on a BBQ joint's menu, let alone with its own citrus sauce that compliments the rich, smoky flavor of the Turkey. \\nI love that they have $2 \\\"good\\\" beers which include hipster favorites such as PBR & High Life. You can pay more for \\\"great beers\\\" but $2 beers is a cheap buzz that I usually take advantage of! \\nThe back patio is tranquil and I can imagine all the future hipster weddings happening here. \\nMy only complaint is the potato salad. I want to love it, I really do. I order it every time- partially because I love potato salad and BBQ (the cooling effect of the cold mayo is in perfect contrast to smoky BBQ'd meats). The flavor is above-par and has gotten rave reviews from the New Times and Yelpers. However, the potatoes are usually under-cooked, which is so sad. However, when it comes to potato salad, I'd rather have my potatoes a bit more soft, than hard, so maybe I'm in the minority. However, the potato salad is my reason for 4 stars instead of 5.

I gave this place a chance when I first moved here from CA per a recommendation from my old dermatologist. I called and scheduled an apt with Dr. DelRosso. Not knowing there were 6 different locations, I assumed it was at the address that was listed with the phone number that I called. The man that took my apt over the phone not only was extremely rude but failed to tell me about the numerous locations. Therefore, I was late to my apt and had to drive all the way to Henderson from Centennial Hills to be seen. Here's the part that pissed me off the most. The dr looked me over and said thank you, and walked out. I asked the nurse what was going on and she said that I have to come back in two to three weeks to get everything I need done. Are you kidding me?! It gets better.. They had me pay a copay when I clearly showed them that I do NOT have one. Got that reimbursed from my insurance due to their incompetence. Now I'm here, three weeks later. I check in and they tell me that I now owe $100! Excuse me?!? I called the office YESTERDAY to confirm and let them know of new insurance and they said great see you tomorrow. And now I get a surprise of the $100. After patronizing me for the money acting like they know more about my insurance than I do, they called them and what do you know, I owe nothing. The Dr will DEFINITELY be hearing from me. Who knows, it's probly going to get worse when I get back in a room. But with the 45 min I've already been waiting, it might be a while.\n\nAnswer:",

This is a vegetarian restaurant that does a range of chinese food dishes with fake meat (gluten). If you are a vegetarian that doesn't care for food that tries to be meat, then there are plenty of other dishes on the menu. All good. I'm vegetarian and don't miss meat but was curious to try things like crispy ginger beaf, lotus cakes, lemon chicken. Tasted great! My meat eater friends said that they came close to the real thing!\\n\\nThe staff are really, really sweet. Very happy and engaging! The owner check in to make sure you are happy. \\n\\nWe were in vegas for three nights and ate there for two of them.\\n\\nThe decor and setup of the restaurant is very clean and simple.

Food is horrible.  Customer service is even worse.  Place is dirty, and not taken care of.  Lights are out, fans don't work.  Everything is filthy, menu's (if that's what you want to call them, they look like a three year old did it) are crumpled dirty pieces of paper that looks like it has been dragged behind a boat, tables, chairs, floors, bar, condiment caddy even the books the bill comes in, all filthy, filthy, filthy.  Garbage dumpsters are located right outside the restaurant and are stacked full of garbage that stinks like you would not believe and is full of insects and I am sure rodents as well.  I was unfortunate enough to pay for their \\\"breakfast buffet\\\"  which consisted of nothing, everything was empty and the little bit they did have made me sick the entire day. My husband went to get me a glass of water and black chunks of grime came out in the glass.  Shows that filth runs ramped and laziness is the norm.   This place is in desperate need of an owner that cares and a staff that knows customer service and professionalism.  They should be ashamed.  Until this changes I would warn all to stay away.  Unless you enjoy paying for watered down booze, filth, bad food, food poisoning and no customer service.  Someone call John Taffer from Bar Rescue!

There were 2 full rooms of lines, I repeat, 2 rooms! I was in a group of girls. So after lining up for about 25 mins (still staying in the 2nd room), we were asked to step to the fast line meaning straight to the cashier and to the club! If you are in a mixed group or group of guys, have fun waiting in line. Maybe make some new friends while wait? \\n\\nVenue: It was huge but packed! I was like in a maze of humans and trying to find my way out to the pool. The indoor/outdoor thing is kind of cool. They even have some gaming tables to play. I was surprised the outside was not hot at all...I wonder how they keep it cool. The design theme is supposed to be a female body, so expect to navigate in a slightly curved space plan and see some nude sculptures hanging on the walls. Seating is plenty and bouncers are not obnoxious at all, they won't yell at you if you sit down at tables. But if it does happen, just go dip your feet in the pool. I saw many girls doing just that.\\n\\nDrinks: The bartender was a little bit slow but I was in my happy mood. As long as I got acknowledged that I would be served soon, I was fine. I had LA water and it was big and strong, compared to those served at other clubs. \\n\\nDance floor: It is fairly large (my cab driver told me it's the largest one thus far in vegas?). Great visual on the big screens around the stage. Lighting pumps with the music and they use coffetti canon instead of the CO2 canon which I hate.\\n\\nMusic: IT WAS AWESOME! Diplo was the headliner but he didn't start spinning until 1 or 1:30. The guy before him was kinda blah, but once Diplo started, I couldn't stop dancing! \\n\\nCrowd: I would say... there were a lot of men. I think the ratio was like 10 men to 1 woman. It was crazy. Thank God most of them were not obnoxious or fratty. Those I met were classy.\\n\\nBonus tip: Apparently, if you are in a group of guys and would like some girls at your table, the bouncers would go out of their way to bring girls back. Pretty is not guaranteed though based on my observation.\n\nAnswer:",

I was a little shocked at some of the prices (in particular the Croque de Fruits) which is yogurt fresh fruit and Quakers Croque Matin. But then the bowl came and I can see why! It was on the side gi-mongus and could have feed a few people. I could only eat about half of it before I had called it quits. \\n\\nIt was amazing however that we got seats straight away (considering it was 1130am on a Sunday) My friend who dislikes breakfast food was disappointed however, that they do not offer any of the lunch options on the weekends. So she ended up with a grilled cheese sandwich that comes with fruit and potatoes (which was surprising a good deal for all that). Lastly my other friend got a regular eggs, toast, bacon, sausage and potatoes. \\n\\nEverything was good, coffee refills were speedy, and overall a decent breakfast place for sure. The only complaints: they opened the door to the patio a bit, and someone was smoking outside, and it came straight inside ruining the smell of breakfast; bathrooms are single stalls, which caused a pretty large lineup of people. Other thing to note: if I get this again, I will ask for the Croque de Fruits without powder sugar on top (unnecessary IMO) \\n\\nI would eat here again if asked. :)\\n\\nPS: They gave out roses to the ladies because it was mother's day!\n\nAnswer:",

She said we were trying to be smart and didn't have money, and she was wasting her time...Even though we tried to be polite, she was rude and unprofessional the whole time because we didn't fall for her scam. Some of her lies & sales pitches were ridiculous and made me wanna laugh.\\n\\nThe two bedrooms that she showed us looked nice when you first walk in. But when you pay attention to the details of the rooms, you can tell they used very cheap material.

Do you really need to be THAT unprofessional? At this point I just wanted to laugh at her again...\\n\\nI saw some people did purchase the timeshare from them.

Best thing was the salt and pepper shaker claw (simple pleasures); marginal crabcakes, adobo shrimp taco was good, french fries (actually very good). Las Vegas fresh fish was bad. Fishy. Lobster roll was so poor our partner did not even finish. They were overwhelmed; very cold if you know what i mean.either frozen and thawed out or just plain.. I would bet because of the reviews (are they for real?); they do take reservations. Very busy with outside that jammed up the seating area and made for poor atmosphere.

I love their salad and the soup is homemade and well worth mentioning. Our favorite thing on the menu is the meatball sandwich. The meatballs are excellent. The portions are pretty generous and the service is fine. There is a good cook here, not someone out back using a micorwave like some places.\\n Just a note it's loud and very sports themed, which is fine if it's your thing. I don't come here often because of the noise or choice of music but that's just me I get nervous ( Think I am getting old..).\\n The owner is super nice and almost always there. If you want to hang out locally and like good food this place is worth a shot. You can eat healthy here, the salads are well done... but beware you get tons of tempting fries with sandwich orders..

I can't complain about the price because it was free since the hotel did not have our room ready although we checked in at like 8pm and we were totally pissed cuz it was the wraparound balcony suite which does not come cheap ya know?  Anyhoo, I was sooo excited to eat this much-raved-about-on-YELP vegas buffet.  It was supposed to be special, different than all the rest, as the reviews told me...I was beyond excited and positive it would be a culinary dream.  But, no.  The food was terribly underseasoned and lacking in variety.  For one, I expect EVERY buffet to have a salad and fruit bar, thats what I live for.  Where was it?  All they had here was 2 pre-made salads already portioned, caesar and oriental this time, already SOAKED in dressing and limp and sad.  Um, no when in Vegas I expect fresh crisp veggies at my buffets, mmmkay?\\nAlso, the dessert bar that was raved about was totally lacking in choices and not exciting or delicious in the least bit.  Overall, I was underwhelmed by the meats, cheeses, veggies, desserts, and everything else at this buffet.  I thought this one for sure would take the crown from The Spice Market buffet @ Planet Hollywood, but no it still reigns supreme...at least on my palate..:-)\n\nAnswer:",

I used to come here when it was Agave and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so I was a tiny bit apprehensive. I'm glad we decided to give it a go!\\n\\nI will have to leave an update for this restaurant because we didn't have THE BEST experience, but it wasn't awful either,...so just the 3 stars will have to do for now. First of all, the seating on the patio is much better than it was under previous ownership. They have more tables outside and it feels more open. I've always loved that patio, but now it is a much more comfortable feel.\\n\\nWhen our server mentioned to us that we were there for brunch so we receive a complimentary cocktail if we would like, we were all about it. We took advantage and my hubby ordered a blended margarita and I ordered a Bloody Mary. I ended up having to send the Bloody Mary back because it tasted like peppered tomato juice. They had no problem substituting it though and I replaced it with a mimosa which was delicious. \\n\\nThe part that bothered us was that after we ordered our complimentary cocktail, we then found out from the server that our drinks were only complimentary if we ordered from the (very limited) brunch menu section. We were already half way through our drinks so we had to stick to that menu and there are really only a handful of options. Had we known this, we would have forgone the drinks and ordered from the lunch menu. \\n\\nWe ordered the breakfast quesadilla, one without bacon for myself, and we waited about 20 minutes after we placed our order and munched on the trio of salsa's in front of us. For those who don't like spicy food - STAY AWAY FROM THE orange salsa. My husband can't handle spice and he mistakenly thought that might be a mango salsa and he was wrong. It was incredibly spicy even to me and I loooove my spicy food. We were both pleased with our meal and the portion siize of these quesadillas are enough to feed 2 people easily. \\n\\nI will be back mainly for the lovely patio, but I also want to give their lunch and/or dinner menu a try.\n\nAnswer:",

It's great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and has a good vibe. Sure, it might be a bit $$ for some sandwiches, but I don't mind because I know they keep it local, in season, and I've had nothing but good service here. There is indoor and outdoor seating (with misters outside so get it in before the temps hit 100's) with a mix of long family style benches, regular seating, and bar seating. There are a few items for sale here, including some local olive oils and knick knacks, nothing like the old Public Market used to be, but I think that's why this place is far more successful than before. \\n\\nMy favorites include the Del Real sandwich, the lentil curry coconut soup (a mouthful to say, but damn tasty), and the Mediterranean Salad. It's a solid spots for your crazy vegan, gluten, dairy free friend. Also, always ask about the special of the day. I've had some amazing sandwiches from some crazy pork belly to mozzarella flat breads. The pork chile verde pot pie is also tasty, but can sell out quick some days. \\n\\nHappy hour starts at 3PM every day and doesn't end until the places closes. That my friends, is how every happy hour should be! $5 house wines, $5 pitchers of select beers on tap (seasonal rotation) and $3 well drinks. I believe there are also some $5 cocktails as well. Basically, come after a long crappy day, get buzzed, eat solid food and enjoy yourself. \\n\\nExpect a crowd a lunch, there aren't many non-shit places downtown to grab a bite to eat, so they office drones come out in herds.

I order an mimosa $8.00 and an a create your own omelette $13 +cheese .89cent. Once again it did take a long time about 35 minutes for my food to be served to me. Once I did get my food I had to send my omelette back because it was still juicy and not completely done. Once my food was served back to me I ate it and it was ok, I wouldn't say the best but at least I actually got food this time so for that I up my stars to 3 starts instead of one.\n\nAnswer:",

Hopefully management makes a few changes because I really want this place to do well!\\n\\nBefore I list my feedback I do want to call out that this place just opened, and it's their first location in Phoenix so they may just need to work out some of these kinks.\\n\\n- Ordering/pick up process is terrible.  just terrible.   The layout of the restaurant is confusing, unorganized and downright uncomfortable.  It's hard to explain but once you order your food you have to wait in this tight, long hallway next to the kitchen where servers run into you to grab food and bring it to some of the tables. At one point the line was so long to wait for food some of the people I was next to had to step outside because it was hot and making them claustrophobic.   Honestly I didn't blame them.  I snapped a quick photo after they had just stepped away which doesn't quite show how tight it was but it will give you an idea of the space I'm talking about.\\n\\n- Quality of my food was less than epic.  I ordered a pick 2 (soup and half sammy).   The most disappointing part was my \\\"French onion\\\" soup.  Normally FO soup comes topped with cheesey goodness and some crunchy bread.   I literally got watery brown broth with onion strips.  Nothing else.       Either they forgot how to make it or ran out of ingredients?  I was in a huge hurry after having to wait so long for my food that I didn't have time to hunt someone down to correct it.   \\n\\n- Napa chicken salad sandwich was dry :(   Not even sure how a chicken salad sandwich could be dry but this one was.  Bummer.\\n\\n- Chocolate chip cookie was good!  I have lots of faith in their bakery section.   Will definitely try more next time.\\n\\n- Server who took my order was very pleasant!\\n\\nOh, Panera.  I want to love you so badly.  I'll be back sometime to give you another shot, and I hope to update this review for the better :)\n\nAnswer:",

I really wasn't blown away with this location.  \\n\\nThe flavors are okay...I liked the NSA flavor best, which is unusual when it comes to froyo. Most disappointing was the oatmeal cookie--my go-to flavor. It was WAYYYYY too sweet and had a slimy consistency after it quickly melted.  I think they were trying to outdo it with the cookie flavor and doubled up on ingredients. Not such a good outcome. My tummy didn't thank me. \\n\\nThe toppings bar is expansive.

First, our hotel room was broken into, and all of our items worth value, were taken.  Our laptops, purses, cash, car keys, jewelry, and liquor all gone!  We reported it to the hotel security immediately, and after their \\\"investigation\\\" they said we were at fault.  So, they didn't have ANY cameras in the hallway, to actually see who came into the room.  We know for a fact that we did not leave the door open, to just let people come in and take our stuff.  It had to have been an employee because you need a key card to get into the building, let alone the room.  The security guard then discouraged us from filing a police report.  Speaking with the Director of Security, and Hotel Manager, they felt that they did not need to reimburse us for anything!  After long arguments they agreed to pay us back $38.  That's nothing!  I'm pretty sure we didn't rob our own room, just to get out of paying a hotel bill.  The employees here are absolutely ridiculous!\n\nAnswer:",

This is so sad because I want to love them and I keep giving chances almost weekly! All summer I have been going there, but more than 75% of the time they are closed during hours that their website and yelp state should be opened.  This is beyond frustrating as they are across town for me and also I have tried to bring a few different friends from out of town only to get there and have to find another place.  \\n\\nusually when I get to eat there, the food is phenomenal; however, I have noticed portions getting smaller and smaller and when the owner is not there they always \\\"run out\\\" of gluten free bread (which is made to order so read: don't feel like mainf it).  Finally, I went yet again today to order my favorite thing, the \\\"BLT gluten free\\\", which I have ordered for four years now, and it was literally about a quarter of the size that it used to be.  I could have eaten it in 3 bites and it was $12.50!! I never usually complain but I did ask if I could either get more or be charged for a half order, since that is what I got.  They were nice and gave me another micro mini sandwich but they both were completely undressed and very different from the usual deliciousness.  They were mediocre at best.  I'm really disappointed and after 4 months of really unfortunate disappointments, not sure I want to keep giving chances to this place... Ugh there goes one of the few vegan options I have... Really hope they get it together Bc I miss 24 carrots!\n\nAnswer:",

The problem is really threefold.\\n\\nOne is that there are so many options.  Even if you get the \\\"full creation\\\", with which you can get any of the throw ins, it's rather overwhelming.\\n\\nTwo is that they aren't presented in a way that the options are easy to understand.  the full creation comes with any of the thrown ins, while with the junior creation comes with a set amount (four, I think) and you pay for each additional one.  That's easy enough, but then you pick lettuce, then you pick the throw ins, then you pick a protein (extra choice, even if you choose a full creation), then you pick a dressing, then you choose if you want it tossed or chopped.  It's just too much!\\n\\nThree is that the options add up (in price) really, really fast.  If you don't like the full creation ($6-9) and go for the junior (approx $2 less), you can easily make up the difference in throw ins - just four will make up the difference in price, not to mention the size of the salad itself.  There is also no simple explanation of size difference (you can ask to see a bowl, but it doesn't really help visualize the difference).  To top it all off - literally - if you want chicken or something on your salad, you're adding to the cost no matter which salad you ordered.\\n\\nThey also have paninis and wraps, as well as soups, but let's face it - you went for a salad, right?  That's like going to Subway for a salad, or ordering a pizza from a sandwich shop.  Hmm.  Guess that does happen.\\n\\nWhat they need is a model more like Subway and less like you're going to get picked to death on every little thing you put on the salad.\\n\\nWhile the quality of the salad itself is pretty decent, trying to figure out the menu board and what goes with what without just getting bowled over (sorry) by what you can order without being taken is too much.\\n\\nThat said, the staff is friendly, and the double-pizza-cutter that chops up the salad is neat to watch - probably worth ordering yours chopped just for that reason.  I just wish it was a nicer experience all around.\n\nAnswer:",

We got to \\\"The Buffet\\\" and there wasn't much of a line at about 6 pm. I have to admit I got a little worried as some of the reviews were not so positive. But let me say, once in and away I went. Sampling just about everything (except the usual filler products such as salads and mashed potatoes) The hit was the Alaskan snow crab legs! Piles and piles of them. They will steam them if you wish but I prefer mine cold. The seafood selections were fabulous. The beef selections were just as great. Great flavored prime rib, Kobe beef, etc. Finishing it all off with fine selections of desserts. We've cut down lately on our intake. We usually try to split a meal but this was an all out shove as much as you can down the throat evening! We left wondering if we would ever desire to eat again.

It's a smaller club, but we really liked it!  Here's my list of pro's and con's of the place.\\n\\nPROS:\\n-Free front-of-the-line entry for girls before a certain time (just look for a guy in a suit in NY, NY hotel handing out free wristbands for the girls). I'm pretty sure he can give you a discount for cover charge for any guys in your group.\\n-Awesome music (top 40 music from the last 10 or so years). Plus, they play music videos on a giant screen that wraps around the entire club, it's fun to watch!\\n-For those who drink, free bottomless champagne for the ladies from 11-12 with your wristbands.\\n-Friendly down to earth crowd, classy guys (and ones that actually understood married = not interested).\\n-Dress code is not strictly enforced (at least on a Thursday night), because I saw people there in jeans.\\n-Not too crowded, there was enough room to actually...dance.\\n-Couches that you don't have to be VIP or order bottle service to sit in! :) Not many places in Vegas have this!\\n-The music wasn't too loud, so you could actually carry a conversation with someone.\\n-Bodyguards are good at keeping the crowd classy and not trashy\\n-Bodyguards did an excellent job of keeping the floors clear of spills, broken glass, etc. They constantly surveyed the dance floor with little flashlights to make sure the floors were clean.\\n\\n\\nCONS:\\n-They do not give you water for free, not even tap water! They make you buy a bottle of Fiji water for $5! (I just used a drink glass after my friend was done to fill it up in the bathroom...but the bouncer tried to convince me it was dirty water so I would buy bottled water. Obviously, he was lying. I told him I was fine with drinking their \\\"dirty\\\" water and went on my way, he just shrugged and let me walk away with my tap water :)\\n-Soda is also $5! Why so expensive, ROK?\\n\\nNote: The bathroom is co-ed. There is a bathroom attendant to assign you a stall for your gender.\\n\\nVERDICT: We had a blast dancing at the ROK and would definitely go back here again next time we are in Vegas. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they charge $5 for bottled water or soda, with no option of getting tap water (and the bodyguard/bartenders were a bit of a jerk about the whole water thing).\n\nAnswer:",

That did not happen.\\n\\nI went in a week later to pick up my pillow covers and they brought out a plastic garbage bag with my pillow cover literally in \\\"pieces\\\".  They said they were going to call me to let me know but just hadn't gotten around to it. I told them this was unacceptable and they said  \\\"We cleaned them just the way you asked us to\\\".

Being close to so many bars and clubs means they get freaking mobbed at 2-3 when everyone is drunk and hungry. They manage to turn tables pretty fast though so the wait isn't terribly long.\\n\\nThe service on the other hand is horribly slow and inattentive. Though this may be because they are packed tighter than sardines in a can. I had to ask three times before I could get my empty water refilled, some of our orders were totally wrong, the bill was wrong as well, and we were ready to order for about 10 minutes before our waitress appeared again. The poor girl looked positively frazzled though and apologized quite a lot so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. After reading Jane F.'s review, I suspect it's because they gave her tables on opposite sides of the restaurant.

I like eggs, but I don't like the deviled egg.  It's not that it detracts from anything, I just didn't really care for it.  It's something like adding lettuce and tomato to every burger that comes out at a burger joint - I'd so much rather have the option, like at Five Guys or Counter.  You know?\\n\\nOn the menu: When you look over the menu, your mouth typically waters.  At least mine did.  Everything races through your mind and your taste buds go mad.  Then the gears start spinning and you have to figure out what to order.  That's when the wheels of the car start to come off.\\n\\nAt this point, I typically either go with the special or ask a server for advice.  When I asked for advice, I was given absolutely no help.  The problem that you run into with the pretty people is that often they have no real-life experience.  A good server will be able to steer you in the right direction.\\n\\nI've even been in situations where diners flat out say \\\"surprise me\\\" and a good server will do just that, with no direction at all.

That's a problem when everything sounds good.\\n\\nOn the food: It is utterly average.  For someone who isn't from the South, then the comfort food of Dish might be fine.  But for someone who lives here, it's decent, but nothing special.  A chicken and dumplings special, for instance, barely stayed warm enough to eat, and had no flavor (both things that have been mentioned by others).

It was hot inside, so we moved outside. There's a small patio on the corner with a few tables and some decent shade. After sitting outside for a few minutes, the owner came out and explained that due to a licensing and ordinance issue, he wasn't able to serve us outside. \\n\\nApparently the city has been giving this place some trouble, and that's a true shame. This corner has seen more than its fair share of businesses come and go; I'd love to see someone anchor-in and launch a truly successful venture here. But if the city and urban development committee are going to be sticklers and uncooperative, it seems destined to struggle. (end of editorial rant)\\n\\nWe moved inside and grabbed seats at the bar. The barstools were pretty cool - they featured old-time tractor seats and were nice and comfy. We browsed the laminated, single-sheet menu and opted for the Bucky Bites, and the Badger Feast. Beer selection was limited to bottles; Ranger for me, Blue Moon for my friend.\\n\\nAfter a minute or two the owner reappeared and apologized for the heat. Apparently the air conditioner had been on the fritz; it was since fixed, but the building was taking a while to cool down. Totally understandable, and not a big deal. We appreciated his candor.\\n\\nBucky Bites arrived - a soft pretzel cut into bites, fried, and served with a small ramekin of nacho cheese sauce. I gotta' say - these were unique and tasty. A guilty pleasure for certain. Well worth the $3.50 price tag. . \\n\\nAs we were eating the bites, round three of bad news came: they were out of chicken. They offered to provide extra portions of the other items, to which we accepted. Not a big deal.\\n\\nThe plate arrived after a short wait, along with sides that included baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad, and a large piece of cornbread.\\n\\nFull disclosure: I'm not a fan of baked beans, potato salad, or most coleslaws. I sampled them all, however, and shockingly liked the potato salad best. It had hints of mustard, and I appreciated the scallions. The beans were slightly sweet, slightly bacon-y, and pretty decent for baked beans (again, I'm not a fan, so I don't get excited by them). The slaw was ok. Portions of the sides were huge - more than enough for 3-4 people. Why they gave us so much is beyond me. On to the platter... \\n\\nBrisket: thick slabs of brisket with a bit of sauce spread over top. Very moist; our pieces consisted of some fattier pieces and some leaner pieces. The fattier ones literally melted as you ate them. The lean ones were still moist. Unfortunately, I didn't detect any evidence of bark or smoke. They were super moist, but I want some bark and some smokey bite. I weren't sure if the brisket had been smoked or roasted; the owner confirmed the brisket was smoked for around 12-hours, which is fairly standard. Unfortunately I didn't pick-up on the smoke (or the rub/bark). \\n\\nRibs/Rib tips: by far the star of the show. Excellent smoke ring, nice rub, and good mix of meat and fat. These definitely tasted as if they had spent some time on the smoker. Very few bones - I think we must have received more of the rib tip than the spare rib section. \\n\\nHam & bacon: these struck me as interesting, because I'm not used to seeing them on a BBQ menu. The ham was a bit dry and tasted like ordinary ham. The bacon was a bit fatty but really tasty.\\n\\nPulled Pork: I was so disappointed. Like the brisket, there wasn't any hint of a smoke ring or a rub, nor any real smoke flavor. I inquired as to whether or not the pork was smoked, and the owner again shared info about the technique, which included the use of a pressure smoker. Super interesting, and it was certainly very moist, but the smoke, rub, and bark were absent. \\n\\nDining friend had a few bites of each; I polished off the rest of the plate, so it wasn't bad BBQ, it just wasn't bursting with any of that smokey goodness. And while I can pack away food with the best of them, I didn't feel like the plate was \\\"overwhelmingly big.\\\"\\n\\nWe had an opportunity to chat with the owner and found him to be extremely passionate about BBQ and his business, as well as very interesting and incredibly friendly. To hear about the effort he's gone through with the business was both inspiring and frustrating at the same time. It really sounds like he's getting nit-picked by the city over things that absolutely shouldn't matter.\\n\\nIt also seems like we were there on an a-typical night, so we'll be back to give them another try. I wish them the very best of luck in this spot - Madison needs a good BBQ place, and I'm hoping they can fit the bill!\n\nAnswer:",

It was newer and fresher then.  We had a corner suite, it was nice & quiet, furniture was in great shape along with everything else in the suite.  We had no complaints.

Our room was ready early, the young lady at the front desk was very nice and the bellhops were ready to accommodate.  They gave us our keycards to get into our room and up we went.  When we arrived at the room it looked as if someone had thrown a HUGE party in it and all of VEGAS was there the night before.  Now I know Vegas is all about parties, however, this is now my room and all your partying should have been straightened/cleaned up by the cleaning crew.  There were stains on the wall (yes the wall had a very large stain on it), the couch, and the floors.  The lamps were broken, they were literally leaning sideways, the lamp shade on the ceiling light was turned sideways??? Really housekeeping, you didn't catch that.  Their were pubic hairs in the Jacuzzi tub......EWWWWWWWW.  Not for real!!!!\\n\\nI will say I called the front desk and they did transfer us to another room, but this is a building of SUITES only.  You are supposed to have excellent accommodations and expecting your guests to stay in a room like that is just disgusting .

LVCS is located on Fremont Street on the second floor above Hennessey's. There's a small banner advertising the Saloon but if you didn't know what you were looking for you'd probably miss it. LVCS is a great music venue that caters to niche markets in music. The venue seems to host a lot of metal, punk, and hip-hop artists. I just recently went to see Nile at LVCS. \\n\\nThe stage at LVCS is small but allows for a more intimate experience with bands. The drinks are expensive,  but are on par with the prices you'd pay at the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay or the Pearl at the Palms. There was a promoter who was passing out 2 for 1 drink passes that we were able to use at the bar inside the venue. Since my husband and I are accustomed to paying $10+ for a beer at concerts, we were pretty stoked we could catch a break for once. The bartender was awesome! She was slammed but we never had to wait longer than a minute to get our beers.\\n\\nLVCS has a great view of Fremont from the concert area and the outdoor smoking section, so there are plenty of opportunities for people watching. The bathrooms were clean but I almost slid off the toilet because the seat was unhinged- but no worries because this is a freaking metal venue! \\n\\nSecurity lets people get pretty rowdy in the mosh pits, which is cool.

The staff are always sitting around doing nothing. It really sucks to go in the restaurant. Their \\\"hibachi\\\" is a freaking joke. Do not expect to get normal hibachi dinners here, in fact, expect absolute crap! Their \\\"regular\\\" Asian menu is joketasiticly inferior to many of the other Asian choices in Squirrel Hill and cost almost the same. The staff seem nice, but jump when any customer walks through the door as if they are not expecting anyone. Now (and please excuse any conceived racist under tones. I assure you I am just stating pure fact), I have had my order screwed up over the phone almost every time I order from Sakura. I understand that you do not need to speak fluent English to take a delivery order, but you should know the menu. Yesterday, My wife and I ordered from there (very inexpensive for a weekday meal) I ordered my sushi correctly, even going over my order 3 times with the woman on the phone. When the food arrived(promptly), our bill was for $70!!!! And as if fleeing from the scene before we could find out, the delivery guy didn't give us a receipt. Upon opening my order, I found that they had quadrupled my order AND CHARGED ME FOR IT!!!!! I called to complain and the woman, who I could barley understand refused to accept that she made a mistake. I became a bit belligerent and she called over her manager. All I could hear was him explaining something in Japanese and the phone girl going \\\"OOOHHHHHH?!\\\" over and over. She DID make a mistake and I was awarded free sushi and my money back. Still, when I said I would be there tomorrow to get the proof of the credit to my card, she initially refused!!????? The manger in the background must of shaken his head or something because she finally agreed. All I want is my damn food for crying out loud!!!!!!!!! But...\\n\\nTheir sushi lunch specials are the best I have ever seen. for $3.99 you have your choice of 6 different kinds of rolls; great for a late day snack (you can order up until 3pm). But...\\n\\nThis is another sushi place that claims to have tuna rolls when they are Fatty tuna rolls, but charge for regular lean tuna. Also order early or you WILL get stuck with day old, been-sitting-around-all-day, hard fish. But...\\n\\nGet them on a good day or early in the day and you will have adequate sushi for a competitive price.\n\nAnswer:",

Being a non-carnivore, I did not have a burger, or even a veggie burger, but opted for the Cobb salad. It was pretty good - I'd probably order it again. It would have been great but I didn't really care for the vinaigrette dressing, although I think that the dressing definitely made it feel a bit lighter, which is a good thing in Las Vegas. I did try the fries, onion rings and sweet potato fries and all were very good. I really enjoyed the sweet potato fries. They're served with ketchup but if you ask for a side of ranch dressing, they'll gladly bring it to you, and the ranch went nicely with the sweet potato fries as well as the onion rings. I also tried the vanilla milkshake and it was pretty delicious. The service was friendly, it was easy to get in for a late lunch, and the prices are not outrageous. I'd return.\n\nAnswer:",

One of the bartenders gave me a VIP card to the joint. He told me, I will have 20% off my bar tab, retail, and no wait in line for me and my friends.\\n\\nSo, this past weekend, I decided to take my little VIP car off on a maiden voyage. We were celebrating a good friends birthday and my friend wanted to check it out as a potential spot for her husband's dirty thirty. It was Saturday night and the line was looong. I had a group of about 8 with me. I go to the front of the line and show the bouncer my card. He asked how many and I told him there were 8 of us. He tells me then, the card is only good for me and a guest. Are you fucking kidding me? I asked, \\\"Where does it state that on here [the card]? And every time I've come before, I've never had an issue with the number of people I brought with me.\\\" He made me lie to kick it (especially since the group before me had like 6 people on one card).\\n\\nHe \\\"graciously\\\" stated that he'd let it \\\"slide\\\" this time. When my sister approached, he wouldn't let her in in her powder puff jersey. She took it off and had a wife beater on and said those weren't permitted. Are you kidding me? We are downtown, not at a club on the strip! He told her should purchase a t-shirt. The shirt was $25 dollars (and it was lame), we didn't purchase it.\\n\\nWhile waiting for the pricing on the t-shirt to come through (it took about 15 minutes), my friends and I noticed several girls in wife beaters and several dudes in them as well. We told this to the long-haired, rat face, just got out of prison looking douche at the door. this; after seeing a very buff black man, he said, the dude was wearing a man-tini. What the fuck is a man-tini?\\n\\nRegardless, this is NOT how you treat your VIPs who have dropped several hundreds in your new establishment and have brought and introduced many people to this venue. If I wanted to be treated like shit, I'd hang out at TAO or LAVO.\\n\\nInsert Coin(s) missed out on my friend spending a minimum of 1000 for her husband's birthday and the few hundred we would have spent that night.\\n\\nSo, IC, if you want to be a club, be a club. Post a dress code. Sneakers and torn up tees are okay, but middle class white girls in wife beaters are clearly gang members and cannot pass? Check yourself or soon, it will be: GAME OVER.\n\nAnswer:",

At the end of our meal he requested some coffee (which is something MANY people drink after dinner), and the waiter informed us that they weren't serving coffee anymore because he had already turned the coffee pot off.  (Keep in mind, the restaurant was open for another hour, AND there is a full espresso bar there)  My friend's father asked if he would really in truly prefer having a customer go to the gas station across the street for coffee, and the terse response he got was, \\\"You can go anywhere you want for coffee, you are just not getting it here.\\\"  The only reasoning I could have had at the time was that it was because my friend's father is South African, and they just don't like dealing with tourists, but after the other night, it's official, THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST SERVICE EVER.\\n\\nThese people need to understand who gives them a job, whether or not the company as a whole is treating their staff like crap, and they're all disgruntled, i'm not sure, but they were definitely not overworked either time that I went in recently and received terrible service.\\n\\nTheir Flaco Torta is great, but that's why I gave them two stars.\n\nAnswer:",

Not too expensive (and BYOB helps).\\n\\nWe headed in after 8:30 on a Friday after encountering a long wait list at D's; Cibo could seat us right away so we went for it. They were out of a few menu items, which I think is acceptable for a small place just a few weeks in. \\n\\nThe menu has a small variety of items - starters, soup/salad, and entrees (including several pasta entrees). I was tempted by the veal but since I've never yet had good veal in the US I decided on the Vongole pasta. It was way spicier than I expected but the preparation was otherwise good. (I also had the \\\"surprisingly spicy\\\" problem at La Cucina Flegrea, where Cibo's chef trained, so that's consistent!)\\n\\nHighlight of the night was the arancini balls I ordered as a starter - really good, mild cheesy flavor, good texture with a slightly crispy outside, and dressed with beautiful fresh tasting tomato sauce. (I haven't tasted sauce that good since Roberto's moved out of town.)\\n\\nRough edges: \\n- The plates are too big for the tables. We had trouble fitting all our dishes on our 4-person table and there were only 3 of us.\\n- It's awfully loud. (Legume had the same problem in a really similar space, and they dealt with it a few months after opening.)\\n- Service was good but seemed uncertain about what they should be doing. There was a lot of conversation and confusion over things like when to clear plates. Could be opening month jitters.\\n- Beans & Greens - the version we had was way too salty, and the greens were left too long for how stringy they ended up being. The salt was overwhelming. They use meat in this dish, which the server warned us; could be that the salted ham they used that night was just too much, but still, they really should have adjusted.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a decent place with some great dishes and lots of promise. Will definitely be back.\\n\\nP.S. The waiter said Cibo is pronounced chee-bo, in case you never studied Italian and were wondering.\n\nAnswer:",

I read the reviews and got an AMAZING deal from Orbits ($45/Night) so I figured even if the worst review was true, it would still be worth the Super 8 Rate I was paying.  \\n\\nWhen we walked into our room (7207) I was immediately reminded of the review that said the room \\\"smelled like a dirty diaper\\\". I had completely forgot about that, and honestly if i hadn't experienced the same exact thing, I probably would have chalked it up to a nit-picky reviewer. I mean, rooms can't smell like dirty diapers!? How is that possible?  Oh, but it is. When i saw that his room (7211) was in the same little room cul-de-sac as ours, I knew we basically had the same experience.\\n\\nIn retrospect I really wish I would have asked to change rooms, but we checked in late and really had to start getting ready for dinner so I just hoped it would be one of those musty smells you get used to and forget about.  I wasn't too pleased with the fact that the first decision of our vacation was whether we could get used to the funky room smell or not.\\n\\nOther than that, everything was pretty nice. I liked the look of the room, the ceilings were wooden with horizontal beams which gave it a kind of cool rustic effect.  Also, the bed faced the huge patio doors, which made the room seem big and open.  The prices everywhere, including the minibar, were reasonable. We didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't say anything about that, but both bartenders we had at the bars were really friendly.\\n\\nThe cookies upon check-in were so good!  That may have been the highlight of the stay.  Not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. Overall, for the price I paid I really can't complain. However, If I would have paid more, I probably would have knocked another star off.\n\nAnswer:",

I almost gave them 4 this time around because a manager approached us as we were having dinner and of course noticed that we had to get up twice to ask if our order was almost ready.

If you have a lot of reservations set up for that day, why wouldn't you schedule more workers?  There were all of 4 when I arrived and the line was easily a dozen folks.  And the line was painfully slow.  I know it's a process & takes time, but good grief, I think I skipped over a birthday or holiday or something while I stood there waiting.  Not a great way to start the experience, I'm afraid.\\n\\nOn the bright side (which is why there is a 2nd star up there), the guy who tended to me was awesome.  He found an extra discount for us and made sure we had one of the newer vehicles.  He was in a great mood & joked around, but was still efficient.  Once he got my information, we were done quickly & on our way.  No delays there!  The vehicle we had was nearly new & very well taken care of, thankfully.  It got pretty good gas mileage and was comfortable for us and the mass amounts of baggage we brought along.  Thumbs up on that portion.\\n\\nSadly, the return service sucked majorly.  While there are signs on where to go to return your car, once you're there, it's not marked very well.  We pulled up & no one was around, so I parked in a spot instead hoping to go find an attendant.  Once we did find one, he was dealing with people who got there after us and then got irritated that I had parked in a spot that was all of 5 feet away from where he wanted me to be.  Sorry for the trouble there, ace.  Maybe you should pay attention when someone drives up instead of hiding out & waiting for us to have to come look for you.  Ugh.\\n\\nHonestly, I'm not sure I'd come back to Avis since there are 10 other rental places in the same building.  Might have to try another company next time.\n\nAnswer:",

Right near the front door and the \\\"extension\\\" seemed to be a small table that was shorter than the main table and tilted towards the floor the slightest bit so we had to be careful NOT to put anything near the join.

What ever you do, don't order the fried fish it was so dried out that it was really hard to eat. Overall it was just okay!

And the really faint smells of hookah trickling in from the room next door. Hookah and hummus - what more could you want from life!?\n\nAnswer:",

I originally wanted to go to a place right up the street from my house called sloppy kisses but called and said they no longer did grooming and really didn't recommend anyone. But I figure Petco has a big retail name and high standards so lets just give it a try well here is my horror story:\\n\\nI called at 10 am on a Saturday to see what the prices were and how long does it take. The gave me the info and it seemed reasonable so I said \\\"Can I make an appointment?\\\" Which I was replied just come in but it will take 2-3 hours due to it being a Saturday.\\n\\nSo I showed up at 10:30 am and then proceeded to wait 3 mins for the person in front of me to finish. I wanted my small papillon to get a bath and a trim. Well she then wanted to sell me on the spa package with scents and other junk. I know I have a small little designer dog but he was a rescue and has very sensitive skin. So I just said no. He just has sensitive skin and needs the oatmeal shampoo. Well then I decided to get his nails trimmed and ended up having to buy that package because it was cheaper and they brush their teeth too. I was all good about it, he had never been to the groomers because I am a do it yourself person. He needed the cleaning after the winter.\\n\\nSo I dropped him off and she said since you are doing all that 3 hours. I will call you, and I walked out at 1045 am. So I had to go to work at 1 and he still wasn't ready. I called and just asked if I could come down and pay and my mom would pick him up when he is done. So I did and then gave them my moms contact number.\\n\\nWell I noticed at 5 pm that I had received no information, so I called my mom and said did you pick him up? No, OK well then have they called? She said no. So I called and spoke with the and they said oh we have just been so busy give me an hour. So my mom comes in at 530 pm because it is just ridiculousness to have a dog who simply needs a bath and scissor cut and a nails clipped to be there more then 4 hours let alone 8. Again we where told no not yet. So finally at 615 pm he was done. He went all day no water! no food!! no pee breaks!!! \\nThis was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AT ANY PLACE!! What made it worse was that this was my first grooming experience, I mean I know its Petco but I work for a major retailer too live up to some sort of company expectations.\\n\\nSo all in all I would give it a 0 if I could. THIS GROOMING CENTER IS HORRIBLE DON'T TAKE YOUR DOGS THERE!! The whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and now I am shopping at a local mom and pop pet store who has recommend a groomer for next time.\n\nAnswer:",

It's a small bar with a very limited menu that basically consists of sausage sandwiches and fries.  I've come twice now and wasn't really blown away by it either time.  It wasn't that it was terrible it just left me feeling underwhelmed.  Service was also a little on the slow side.  It was hard to get the waiter's attention and it took a while to do things like place our order.\\n\\nThe second time around I actually tried the food here.  I went for the regular poutine.  You can add sausage to it for an additional fee which I did opting to add cheddar-bacon sausage on top.  The sausage was good but I felt that the poutine could have been more salty since it was kind of bland.  \\n\\nThis is definitely a bar where you go for beer.  Their sangria is good but I wasn't really a fan of the mojito I tried.  They have a pretty good beer selection looking at the menu.  \\n\\nPrices are in line with other bar.  Like I said this place doesn't blow me away.  I'd probably come back but I wouldn't make an effort to come here.\n\nAnswer:",

I found these guys here on Yelp and read through the reviews. There were a lot of great ones so I decided to give them a shot. Here's how it went. \\n\\n- I sent over an online request for a quote on Saturday. Even though it was not during their listed business hours, they still gave me a call. I wasn't near the phone so we ended up playing a little phone tag. Since we didn't connect on Saturday, they promptly called me Monday morning to talk to me about my move. \\n\\n- We went over my needs and costs. We agreed on getting a 3 man crew. The price was $129/hr plus a $129 travel fee. No other hidden costs. All the dollies, moving blankets, and shrink wrap were included in the cost. I decided to go ahead and schedule for Saturday. \\n\\n- Friday they called to confirm, made sure they had all my info correct, and said they would see me bright and early the next morning. 7am!!\\n\\n- 6:45 Saturday morning. The truck rolls up, 3 guys get out and start prepping and ring the doorbell. They all introduce themselves and ask for a tour. We walk through and point out what's going and they start immediately. They came by to have me initial the actual start time and didn't start the clock until 7. They didn't charge for the walk through which was great!  \\n\\n- I sat back and did very little. I let the guys do their thing and tried to stay out of the way. They were careful with all my belongings and moved pretty quick. \\n\\n- After about 1 1/2 hours the truck was loaded. They confirmed the address and cross streets and off they went. \\n\\n- I beat them to the new house by about 5 minutes. They rolled up, gave them a quick walk through and off they went. \\n\\n- Unloading was a little slower due to having to move all my stuff into a basement. Nothing to complain about though. They were still very careful with everything. \\n\\n- overall it took 4 hours and 15 minutes including a 30 mile drive across town. \\n\\nI spent a little more than I wanted to but I feel it was worth it. I was very happy with the crew and their professionalism. I will be using Just-In Time for all my future moves!!\n\nAnswer:",

I was thrilled that Surfset was part of yelp fit club.  Drew A. generously squeezed me, Eric R. and my visiting brother Jeffrey L. into the third class so we can rock our core, hardcore!\\n\\nI knew almost everyone in my class, and it was fun working out with y'all.  The instructor was so good (of course she was!) and I have to say that this was no easy feat.  There was definitely a lot of core, arms, legs, and strength exercises.  Balancing initially was very scary but I held my core in and just did my best.  The frog hopping hurt like hell and the lifting the legs and jumping side to side of the board caused me to slam both inner ankles on the board and I had huge bruises form.  No guts, no glory!  For those who were not in our class, Eric R.'s extreme clumsiness caused him to fly off the board a few times, once almost all the way to the speaker along the mirror!  It was kind of amusing but I hoped he didn't hurt himself!\\n\\nAt the end of class, we could not find the vitacoco or kind stuff though we asked.  I think the yelp rep took them before our class started to her car or maybe the previous classes took them all.  Oh well!  The yelpers from my class schmoozed at the end.  I am really glad I tried this class.  I woke up yesterday super sore in the core (nice rhyme!) and then hiked all day.  I think I am too sore and tired for barre3 tonight so I will take time to recover, thanks to advil.  Thanks Yelpcrew for making this possible!\n\nAnswer:",

It was only a year ago that I would have awarded this restaurant the coveted 5 star rating. But ever since Howard Seftel gave Golden Buddha such a glowing review in the Arizona Republic this establishment has gone downhill drastically. \\n\\nIt's almost as if the said \\\"Screw it! We got our good review so now we can put away all the quality ingredients, cease polite and speedy service and basically charge everything that made this place good.\\\" \\n\\nI LOVE dim sum so despite the deteriortating conditions I still eat here a lot. But I don't have to be happy about it, do I?\\n\\nAnd now it IS pretty bad. It starts at the host stand. I hate to call them out, but if there is a wait, they seat Asian people before Whitey!!! I actually sat and observed this on more than one occasion. I'm all for giving a little preferential treatment to your friends and family but there is no way the guy at the front knows every single Asian in town. \\n\\nI love dim sum so I wait.\\n\\nThe dim sum carts rarely come around. When they do come around they are filled with the same sparse selection of items.  The whole idea behind dim sum is variety so I wish they would provide a more diverse selection. The stuff they do put out is often cold and limp. This is because they circulate the same stuff round and round again until it's gone. I understand they don't want to waste food, but there comes a certain point where it's over. You just can't serve egg rolls that are cold and hard as a rock. Isn't that a health code violation?\\n\\nI also wish they kept sauce on the table like other Chinese restaurants. Here they only keep watered down chili paste/oil blend (worst quality available) and really salty soy sauce. Most places also make mustard and sweet sauce available. If you ask for said sauces at Golden Buddha they squeeze one dollop into a container the size of my thumb - for everyone in your entire party to share! Party on one? One dollap! Party of three? One dollap! Party of nineteen? One dollap!!!\\n\\nThe universal sauce bottle is kept on a podium next to the dirty dish rags, incidentally. The to-go boxes are stacked here too.\\n\\nI went here for dinner once. I tried to order an appetizer before my dinner and the manager/waiter guy said 'NO! You must order everything at the same time!\\\" I tried to tell him that I wasn't sure what I wanted for dinner yet, but I'd like to start with some pot stickers and he repeated \\\"No! You must order together.\\\" Then he mumbled something about the kitchen being too confused for two separate orders from one table. I was dumb founded.  \\n\\nThis is the place the Arizona Republic gives top awards??? I think it's time for another visit Howie.\\n\\nI don't know if new management took over or what, but if they keep going down this path of cheap ingredients, no selection and poor service they will lose me forever. Which sucks because I hate to drive to Chandler for dim sum when there should be some great dumplings right in my own backyard. I should give it only 2 stars, but I'm a sucker for any dim sum, no matter how crappy, salty or cold it is.\\n\\nShape up Golden Buddha! I miss you!\n\nAnswer:",

Anyway, here is my lousy experience: \\nWe were staying at the Stratosphere and where too lazy to go out to eat at some other location. So we agreed to check out the Italian restaurant inside the hotel. The place was cute, lots of people in there so we figured that it had to be good. The service was good and I water was really nice. I asked him what he recommended and he suggested the Mediterranean Linguine and since I love seafood I went with it. We were a party of four so we also ordered an appetizer of stuffed mushroom and garlic cheese bread. The appetizer came and the mushroom was alright. Nothing out of this world, it was all covered in a tick layer of cheese, so of course it was going to taste good. That was about the only thing that tasted good in our entire meal. The garlic bread was terrible. It was literally old bread with melted cheese and no garlic flavor. My pasta was discusting! All the seafood was chewy and over cooked. So I tried to eat just the pasta alone and it tasted horrible too! Everyone in my party ordered something different and no one finished their meals. The two gusys ordered steak and I guess it was ok (they both said that the one at the buffet was better) but their sides of potatoes and pasta tasted horrible. The other girl that was with us ordered veal parmesane and she barely touched it.\\nThen we got the $120 dollar tab , with gratuity included I have to add. And it was painfly to pay. EVERYTHING TASTED TERRIBLE! First time this happens to me anythwhere. Anyway, never EVER coming back\n\nAnswer:",

I have worked in the auto repair business myself and am pretty knowledgeable about the workings of an automobile.  This shop HAS NEVER steered me wrong! They are VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE mechanics. Last month I had an accident with my 1996 Camry and was fearful that the repairs would be more than the blue book value of my car.  Within 2 hours after it was dropped off at their shop, Mark called me with the diagnosis and calmed my fears. They worked with the insurance company's adjuster, let my car remain there for almost 3 weeks without charging me any storage fees while they shopped for parts which in and of itself wasn't easy to do considering the vehicle's age. I was consulted by their mechanic assigned to my repair, Jim, at each step of the repair. The total cost of the repair wound up being over $400 LESS THAN the insurance company adjuster's claim totaled. I LOVE THIS PLACE! and recommend it every time someone asks me if I know of a good, honest mechanic shop.\n\nAnswer:",

If you are looking for an ever-so-slightly overpriced sandwich salad or soup with a bit of southern California feel, then this is the place for you! Everything is basically a la carte, but worth it. The crowd is typically business folks on their lunch breaks, so don't even try to get quick service around noon. The sandwiches are all homemade recipes, and come with a bit more flavor than your regular sub or soup in a can...and they have italian sodas! Yay for that! Every month or so they feature a local artist on the walls too, so you can enjoy your sandwich and some nice artwork. When it is cool out, the patio is always packed. It's a bit hard to find because of its corner location, but look for it. You will not be let down.\\n\\nRecommended sandwich: The chicken salad on sourdough.\\n\\nRecommended salad: The baja. The avacado is so fresh everytime.\\n\\nRecommended drink: Strawberry Vanilla Italian soda with cream.\n\nAnswer:",

Dinner included one of the best soups I can remember having (some kind of spicy split pea with an incredible depth of flavor) and a zesty, minty salad drizzled in olive oil. Main courses were a) some kind of zucchini in an oily tomato sauce, b) fava bean stew, c) falafel with hummus, and d) some kind of spinach/ phyllo dish. There was also pita served with the meal.  The zucchini had a great flavor, and while oily, it was not a bad \\\"oily.\\\" I'm not sure that I would want to eat a whole plate of it but, alongside the rest of the food it had a very fresh, very delicious flavor. The fava beans were by far the best entree, a salty and smoky stew that was very hearty. The spinach pie was definitely an acquired taste--some kind of exotic flavor within the filling that was hard to place and which my girlfriend did not care for--but I ate two helpings. The falafel was amazing, very crisp outside and moist, well-seasoned inside. Maybe as good as Bunky's. \\n\\nWe were also served a delicious baklava dessert, although the coffee was sadly a bit burnt. My girlfriend had the tea, however, which she described as excellent. \\n\\nThe service was very good--extremely attentive and willing to please, almost excessively so. It has a much nicer atmosphere inside than you would expect from the strip-mall interior. \\n\\nAll in all, very good food. Would recommend.\n\nAnswer:",

The service and people were nice, but the stone crab claws were mealy (the fatty part, not the meat). We spoke with the waitress and a manager. they were both gracious and took off 20% from the bill, but the manager said that's how the crab was suppose to be, \\\"because it came from the ocean.\\\" I've never had a mealy crab before. I didn't like the texture. The flavor was good.\\n\\nAccording to the menu, one crab claw was ripped from each crab on the boat, and the crab was then released. I'm guessing that the claw has to be frozen with this technique.  I'm accustomed to having the whole crab just boiled live. Maybe mealy crab is something to get accustomed to for sustainability?\n\nAnswer:",

Really good food for a minimal price. They also give a military discount. Their Vietnamese sandwiches are pretty decent. Place is cramped so don't bring a huge party.\n\nAnswer:",

A replica of \\\"Arnold's\\\" from Happy Days is what it is all about here. Great burgers, shakes and different flavors of fountain drinks! Definitely a must when in the area of the South Point Hotel and Casino. Also a favorite of the hotel guest!\n\nAnswer:",
