In the end, the message this movie seems to send is that even nerds can be jerks if they try hard enough!Another point --- would Booger REALLY be a nerd at an average college? He seemed to me to be more like the kind of guy who would be persecuting nerds. College is full of beer-drinking, burping, low-life \"party-dudes\" like he is portrayed to be. As for the gay black guy and the brainy kid, I seriously doubt they'd feel right at home with the Nerd frat, either!\n\nAnswer:",

Great rock. Heavyer than most stuff then. But contrasted with Ozzy's kinda whining voice.The A Side is nearly perfect. Especially the 7:24 minute title track - nearly epic. Other highlights are the opener Mr Tinkertrain and the closer Road To Nowhere.

It is an excellent collection of data and photographs of the Minesweepers and Armed yachts of the USN in WWII. While it contains no service records of the vessels concerned, it has many technical readouts of a very varied collection of very necessary ships. No WWII navy got by without buying and requistioning a collection of Yachts, many of which performed valuable roles in the naval war. In addition, it also contains the readouts of the Minesweepers of the USN. A minesweeper is a minimal ship, whose purpose is to find and render useless a very ugly naval weapon. They didn't get much glory, but they did save many lives. Sadly you don't get any deck plans, and there is no index, but a lot of good stuff is found between these covers.\n\nAnswer:",

It's a bad game and the developer is hoping it will sell because of its sex appeal and intense amounts of gore. Don't be fooled, this game is going to be a mediocre (at best) action game. The game is basically a rip off Max Payne, Devil May Cry 2, and Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain with a lot more gore, sex appeal, and the gameplay doesn't nearly match up to the games it is \"ripping off\" from. The gameplay is supposivly very similar to Resident Evil. Although I love Resident Evil, this game is a fast paced action game and RE's controls are better suited for survival-horror..not action.Remember..there are lots of games out there with a lot of sex/gore appeal but that doesn't make them all good. Some such as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, BMX XXX, Resident Evil, or Mortal Kombat:Deadly Alliance (trust me, it will sincerely be a good game) will be good but others such as BloodRayne are just trash.\n\nAnswer:",

Female readers will sure enjoy this novel better than most male counterparts. Typical to most lady writers, details are presently vivid on the characters and actions they did.If you are looking for a Da Vinci Code-like thriller in this book, you might as well forget about it. I almost abandoned this book after 100+ pages of nothing. But I strived to finish it, since Miss Mosse is one of the Orange Award on literatures, and she must have some \"muscle\" at the end. It did have some muscle. It was a good recount on historical accounts of Alaise, superimposing the plot with current day Alice Tanner (who is Alaise's descendent).Not recommended for anyone looking for a fast paced story, but recommended for romance and historical buffs alike.\n\nAnswer:",

Most of the material is his well-known novelty music, while a few are based on his relatively obscure electronic music. This is a nice recording but not a vital one, unless one is a major Scott fan.The band has a nice French cafe sound, effected by the accordion and zither, and the arrangements are jazzy and touch on a variety of styles, from cakewalk to early rock and roll to a John Barry/James Bond quality, and are all well done without being particularly exciting or adventurous. The mixing is a little dense, and the band is let down by a rather lugubrious drummer. My personal feeling is that Scott's work is crying out for a treatment a la what John Zorn did on the incredible 'The Big Gundown' for Ennio Morricone's movie themes.

This thing destroys what ever you put inside of it in no time at all. When I would make smoothies or mixed cocktails in my old B&D it would take twice as long and the ice wouldn't be nearly as well chopped. Another nice thing about this blender is its glass bowl. It's nice and heavy and pours real nice. My old one would make a mess when pouring and this one pours real clean. Bottom line...I paid $40 for this and it definitely worth every penny.\n\nAnswer:",

It is based on a true story of a dog named Hachiku that waited 10 years for his deceased owner to come back for him (look it up on the internet). Of course, this is the Americanized version of the true Japanese story, but it is, by all means, a fair account. Be prepared to cry your eyes out, though, because as this story proves, the true loyalty and unconditional love of a dog for its owner is very special.\n\nAnswer:",

We have been pleased so far to see much of what we enjoy still in the show although we would prefer the original cast and with more interaction with a secondary group made up of some newcomers instead of what we see. The show is still too good to pass up on and the DVDs view so much like movie quality that we still have to give it the full 5 stars.

This is because all of the characters have been upgraded and they all have new moves.As for the graphics. We all know that the ps2 is a graphics machine. And TTT is no exception. As far as I'm concerned, TTT on the ps2 looks better than any game in the arcade, PC, or dreamcast to date.If you want a game that won't collect dust on your entertainment center after 10 hours of gameplay, then I highly recommend you look into this game.

Plus some of the moves with weights could definitely hurt you if you are using a heavy weight. I normally work out using 10 - 20 pound weights and could only use 5 pound weights for most of the video because of the speed and number of reps.

You will learn about every one of Conlon's relatives who became a cop, about movies like The French Connection, Serpico, and the Godfather, and even about forgotten patriot Gouverneur Morris -- and his brother!! Yep, Conlon definitely stayed awake while at Harvard. The man is a walking, talking raconteur and spewer of information.Yet, there is a very good book in here. The stories about Conlon's police work might strike some as repetitive, but what the police do IS repetitive. If they are on the drugs beat, for example, they don't investigate bank robberies. They deal with drugs, day in and day out. So I think he paints an honest picture of police work.Plus, many of his stories are downright hilarious.So, hang in through the early sections, don't be too annoyed by the avalanche of acronyms, and overall you'll enjoy the book.\n\nAnswer:",

I think some of the material mentioned in this book really could happen in the future if we let it. This is a fairly good book overall, but I'm rating it a 2 out of 5 stars because I was just confused. I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars.\n\nAnswer:",

Cover looks like they stretched out the image on MS Paint and the paper is extremely low quality. If they had kept it the size of an average book it would be decent but it's uncomfortable to read and feels as if you're reading an 8th graders math workbook. They made it so large that and thin that it looks like a child's picture book. There are no marks that tell you where the introduction ends and the real story begins or anywhere marking new chapters.

I think for many fans that this will be the right amount. King is just too good and too prolific for a one disc sampler and 4 CDs is a big box and big bucks for many fans. What this set is missing is the first 13 years or so of BB's career (there were many good songs there), the last decade (still worthwhile music) and just a very light sprinkling of the 1990's. His over 50 year career is just too big even for a big 2 disc set but you will get a lot of quality music at a reasonabale price here. I like the fact that there is some live music here along with the studio cuts.Besides being a great guitarist, King has a great voice, is a fine songwriter and an excellent interpreter of others songs and has had a great stage presence. If you have all that and a little luck, you can be successful for as long as BB King.\n\nAnswer:",

While it fills time between Murakami books, I find both strength and weakness in its form (a story told through a series of letters exchanged by former spouses who have been apart for 10 years). The problem with writing a book in the form of letters is: 1. the author's need to maintain proper writing (grammar, punctuation etc.) at the expense of the character's natural writing style (are they both such perfect writers? we'll never know); and 2. the hard-to-ignore fact (perhaps just in this case) that the letters are indeed written by the same person (the author).

The transliteration of names into English is not too good, on occasion to the point where you cannot recognize them sometimes, and names in the original scripts are not included. Further, some towns and villages are shown on the map that don't seem to exist, while existing ones are excluded - maybe this is due to outdatedness as others have mentioned. In total, I found the small maps within the Lonely PlanetGeorgia Armenia & Azerbaijan (Multi Country Guide)a lot more helpful than this map. Note that this map shows large parts of Georgia, but the best maps for Georgia at various scales are available from Geoland (in Tbilisi and online: geoland.ge).\n\nAnswer:",

I had the cage on my wooden garage workbench. The ball rolled off the top of the cage onto the workbench and the clips that hold the ball together broke. The depth of the bottom pan is not nearly deep enough as half the bedding ends up on our floors. The ball clouded up from gerbil waste within hours of them moving in, requiring it to be cleaned daily, unless you like watching waste go around in circle. Ball was noisey and really seemed to be held on ever so precariously. Really not pleased with this cage.\n\nAnswer:",

This is truly one of the worst things I've ever heard. Techno-Zeppelin?? Riot-Zeppelin??? Some of the tracks bear absolutely no resemblance to the original scores. I thought it was bad enough when \"Dred Zeppelin\" came out with their awful Elvis-sings-Rasta-Zeppelin music, but this remix \"tribute\" (more accurately, an insult) to one of the greatest and most enduring bands of the rock genre is simply repulsive. Please - don't buy it. In fact, write to your Congressman and DEMAND that this sort of mockery be made a federal offense...I'd hate to see the look on Robert Plant's face when he gets a load of this cover-band dementia.\n\nAnswer:",

Having seen \"Clutch Cargo\" I thought I had seen the lowest of cheap animation, but NO! They took almost every panel from the comic, recolored them, and simply animated the mouths and arms! How much did Marvel pay for these cartoons back in 1966?!? The second episode, \"The Power Of Dr. Banner\", was even worse! And yet, somehow, I still felt I got my money's worth...simply for the origin story. You do get to see the classic Kirby artwork on the TV screen.

So this was the result - more simplified vocal layers and guitars - a little less epic but still powerful and heavy. Hansi's voice still shines as well. I think this is probably one of BG's darker albums, and sounds a bit more closer to conventional heavy metal rather than power metal but overall does not stray the listener away from the band being \"Blind Guardian.\" This is still a pretty solid CD that hardcore Blind Guardian fans may want to give a chance.\n\nAnswer:",

Using the selective focus feature doesn't help as some part of the image will be always out of focus. The Coolscan may produce a 4000 dpi scan, but it will not be sharp center-to-edge unless the film is absolutely flat -rarely the case. This problem offsets any advantage of using high-quality optics on your camera. This is a situation where the (excellent)specifications do not give the true indication of the results.\n\nAnswer:",

This movie started out bad, and just got worse. We can assume that this is in part due to Shatner's total inability to direct. Then again, the fact that Shatner's so bad at directing at least gives some degree of symmetry to his acting and singing skills. This movie was obviously made in order to advance the series from the good (but too-cute) Star Trek IV to the great (but Montalban-free) Star Trek VI. If there's going to be one Star Trek movie that's truly worthy of overripe fruit, this is the one. Buy this one to prove to your friends that you don't like anything with a Star Trek title.

I think these two works (together, perhaps, with no. 7 in B flat) to deserve comparison with the Bach Brandenburg Concerti (which are of course the pinnacle of the concerto grosso genre). They are complex, sophisticated, and possessed of an impressive expressive range. This is very emotional music, true to the wont of the Baroque: look elsewhere for something quaint and decorative.The other works here do not quite attain to the standard of nos. 2 and 10, but they are nevertheless thoroughly satisfying pieces and obviously the work of a great master. The performances here are generally lithe and effective, though perhaps just a touch lacking in emotional involvement every now and then. This last is only a very minor complaint, however; I heartily recommend this album.\n\nAnswer:",

And the comic songs isn't very clever, although \"It's Tough to be a God\" comes close.

The thermostat also gives you the current temperature, which is also very convenient.I've also own two 1000 watt Zilla thermostats, and I prefer the Hydrofarm over the Zilla for two reasons: (1) Hydorfarm's is digital, which makes setting an exact temperature possible, and (2) it displays the current temperature.

On the upside, the vacuum generates an impressive amount of suction. It picks up pet hair and is great on stairs.On the downside 1) the \"filter\" is not terribly efficient. When you empty the dirt cup make sure to power the unit back on outside - it emits a very substantial cloud of dust when you first turn it on. Better still buy three or four extra filters and wash them between uses. 2) The dirt cup is quite small and requires frequent emptying. This then leads to the problem noted in 1). 3) The slide switch that selects the operating mode and releases the dirt cup jammed. The only way to operate it was to force the switch with a screw driver. Then the switch broke, rendering the vacuum useless. I really miss my dirt devil.\n\nAnswer:",

But, my point is that it's really cool you can take pictures with your Gameboy Color or Gameboy Advance.The downsides are that there is no flash on the camera, and the pictures aren't in color. Plus, it's not really an actual game, so young players might get bored easily with it.The camera is cool; it can swivel around. The downside about that is that young players might accidently twist it off completely, or just damage it out of frustration.The lens can be cleaned with eyeglass cleaner and a soft cloth, preferably the kind you get with your glasses at the eye doctor's office.A young kid could poke a pencil inside and penetrate the lens.My final thought is that is very interesting, very fun, but I would not recommend you to buy this for children under the ages of 8.\n\nAnswer:",

I hope that I'm wrong, and that they bounce back, but 100th Window is a big letdown. Not terrible, but certainly not up to their usual standards. 100th Window may appeal to some (it reminds me vaguely of Radiohead, whom I also find dull but others like).

His disappearance is not the last as someone else disappears every day.

Barrett does a great job of introducing and finishing the story with his pre and post notes that hint as if Rowley was a real person and theses are real memoirs. I don't rate this higher because I had trouble identifying Rowley as a character. Rowley doesn't give the impression that he's fallen \"in love\" with his captor (though he no doubt believes that he has), but rather he's been brainwashed by her. His actions and attitude indicate psychological injury not unlike a Patty Hearst Syndrome, and the reader ends up feeling a pathetic pity towards Rowley. Again, the best parts of the book are Barrett's own narratives, which entice you to research these Taiping warriors and learn more about this period of Chinese history. An ample escapist story to tide you over, but a far cry from 5 stars.\n\nAnswer:",

The novel is not nearly as imaginative as you would believe, given the premise of the story itself. Aside from the circus setting, this is a very conventional book story-wise. Which isn't necessarily a problem, except that the author attempts to stretch the story beyond what it is, often falling way too in love with her writing and going on for long, descriptive asides that lead nowhere.

If I accidentally cut those vines, I'll be in big trouble, and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks. The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well, and though I only use them a few times a year, they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again?

A few are instrumental pieces but most are songs and they are all a joy to hear.The instrumental pieces are the more \"classical\" in the sense that they could have been done at an earlier time. The songs, though, have a youthfulness about them that screams \"modern\" but does so without losing the cultural heritage or style. Most are fun songs. All are great songs.This is an album to enjoy!\n\nAnswer:",

The author tells a cautionary tale about life in the fast lane, and the things that can happen when one falls prey to the call of the fame game.The characters are diverse, as are the storylines that bind them. I can't say that any one of the characters is particularly compelling or likable, but their stories will most certainly keep the reader turning the pages to see what happens to them. The book is definitely a guilty pleasure. Fans of Jacqueline Susann and Jackie Collins will, undoubtedly, enjoy this book.\n\nAnswer:",

The rest of the musicians are OK, the vocals weak, but John Cippollina's talent was on an entirely different level and very little of his work was recorded. The strongest lyrics here are on Hamilton Camp's old folk song \"Pride Of Man,\" but the best QMS moments for me were always instrumental. Dino Valenti was in jail and did not appear on this recording which gets it an extra half star from me. There were better bands overall around back then but John Cippollina didn't play in any of them. This was a great band live so of course their label never bothered to put out a live recording. I still listen to it a couple times a year after 40yrs which can't be said of many other recordings of the period.\n\nAnswer:",

Boy that sure teaches those libs! Alas the book merely gives a weary beer gut to back up that and other attempted \"outrageous\" statements. What did intrigue me about this book was that I kept picturing Michael as a fat little kid who was picked on and bullied, and now that he's uh \"grown up\" (well sort of) he's going to be one tough dude - or at least from the safety of a microphone. And true to those who have been trod upon too long instead of taking up the cause of the downtrodden Mr. \"Savage\" attempts to become one of the oppressors. All very psych 101 and explored with more interest in Orwell than here. But I suppose if you've had a few too many bong hits and Hannity is feeling a little to intellectual steep for you one might slum it out here if you need shelter from thinking, self dignity, or genuine virility.\n\nAnswer:",

The graphics and controls are decent, meaning that you can generally distinguish targets and terrain and the movement isn't difficult to master. The fundamentals of the game are sound in that the solo missions are satisfying, the campaigns follow the same theme as the solo's, but it's the multiplayer that is the biggest let down. Unfortunately there are cheat codes that find their way into the multi-play. So, for example, if you are playing flagball and someone is using speed-cheat, forget it, the game is over. And there is almost always at least one person cheating. Artillery support in King of the Hill is equally ruinous of any fun.I definitely wish I had picked up another game. Once you get tired of the solo work, which is quick, the multiplay is so dissappointing that there is no long term value in the game. Wait for something better.\n\nAnswer:",

Why the low rating, then? Lakoff and Turner are structuralists, and they repeat everything over and over again, breaking things down to their minute building blocks. They made a very convincing argument in the first chapter, I thought, and didn't need to keep going the way they did. The third chapter, in which they apply their theory to a William Carlos Williams poem is also very good. Those two chapters would have sufficed.

There's really nothing catchy about the songs (the exception being \"I Love This Bar\"). This album is primarily filler material. I find that whenever artists release albums fairly quickly, as was the case with this CD, they don't seem to have much to offer. Perhaps Toby Keith should have allowed himself MUCH more time to write a CD with substance after the release of \"Unleashed\". I'm pretty disappointed with the album, and pretty angry that ~$15.00 was wasted on it.As an aside, I find it pretty pathetic that artists are using the 9/11 attacks as a way to make their albums sell. These artists don't need to rehash it on their CDs.\n\nAnswer:",

Margarine contains unhealthy hydrogenated trans-fats, and it is extremely bad for you. It is not something I want to be putting into my body, and I am a bit surprised that Ms. Zukin would choose this as a butter substitute.There are other substitutes (such as unrefined coconut fat) that are much healthier. Unfortunately, I do not have the time or patience to experiment with replacing margarine with coconut fat in so many of her recipes.I have yet to find a dairy-free cookbook that provides a healthy butter substitute.\n\nAnswer:",

The more I listen, the more I love it, I didn't realize how talented she truly is.I'm listening to Mean Sleep as I type this review and I keep stopping to jam with her and Lenny! LOL.Okay here's some highlights: Deliciously Down, Mean Sleep, Fall, Soul Sister, Curious White Boy, Miss Moon and Still Heart.It's definitely poetic; the lyrics are beautiful and different...not typical by any means.

It was obvious that Neal's presence was missed. Now that Testimony is here, I remember what I love so much about Neal's music. Neal has a way of taking you on a musical journey. With Testimony we get awesome musicianship along with moving lyrics. Testimony leans more towards a Transatlantic sound rather than Spock's Beard, but it is different also. The album is heavy in orchestration. It is very powerful. The lyrical content is really good. Neal is telling his personal story and tetimony of how he came to know Jesus. Some have said that it is churchy, but since this is the things that he has experienced in his journey, he must express them how he saw and felt them, be it churchy or not. I am very impressed and excited. If you are a Neal Morse fan, you will not be let down. If you are looking for great music with a great message, then check this out!\n\nAnswer:",

It starts off with a small section on motion and the human bone and muscle system, then moves into detail on action moves such as running and walking from many different angles. The bulk of this book is on battle moves, and they have a ton to show you. Everything from chops and punches to roundhouses and elbow strikes is right in this book from many different angles. The only reason I gave this book four instead of five stars is because I really think they could have gone into more detail on the muscle systems, and there are no weapons in this book. Although they show it on the cover, they don't show how to animate your characters with weapons. A small downside, but it still is a great book to learn many different types of action especially battle moves.\n\nAnswer:",

It is not his best either content wise or photo wise. Many of the photos are blurry or look like they were re-touched and look like paintings. I believe this is the first one that he wrote and it shows. That said, the photos are rare and good. He tells a lot of stories about how he got started and how he took some of the pictures. It's pretty funny to hear how he talks about keeping his techniques secret from other wannabe photographers. Petty maybe but nontheless entertaining. Sean's last book called Elvis In Focus is essentially a re-write of this book with better quality. The fact that this book has some different photos and different stories makes it worth finding. A word of caution- the last time I got an e-mail from Sean he said that he had only 2 copies of this book left and if I wanted to know the price I had to ask him. As with all of his books, it is hard to find and expensive.\n\nAnswer:",

The grammer, punctuation and sentence structure is so poor in places that it is hard to follow the story as you would a regular book. Clearly this book is either self-published or published by a very small publishing company. No major publisher would print a book with such blatant errors. When the author is trying to make a point, the typestyle, which is much larger than necessary to begin with, often changes to all capitals. Sentences are ended with several exclamation points, I assume for effect. In reality this just comes across as BEING SHOUTED AT BY THE AUTHOR! (See what I mean?) I understand the author wanting to preserve her original feelings and impressions about the events she describes but this book would have been much more helpful if it look more polished and professional.

Most of the other actors are pretty good, Robert Shaw and Edward Fox especially, and Barbara Bach looks luscious (and as a bonus, she gets about as naked as you can get in a PG-rated movie).In short, this movie is clearly inferior to the original \"Navarone\" as well as other MacLean-inspired movies like \"Where Eagles Dare\" and \"Ice Station Zebra.\" Inferior doesn't mean bad, but it's still the worst movie that I've ever seen more than 5 times.\n\nAnswer:",

So, maybe I'll try it again --- But I hope she or her editor read these reviews and that she NEVER gives her characters such wierd names again, trying to be clever?? because she's losing fans.\n\nAnswer:",

First, the batteries just don't stay charged long enough. We own a house but on a small lot and only use this for weed eating around the edge of the yard. The two batteries can't hold enough charge to accomplish that small feat in one day. And today, after less than a year, it blew up and the motor caught fire. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand cheap $20 electric weed eater with a long extension cord. We had bought one to replace this one and were only using this one to reach where our extenstion cord wouldn't reach for the other. With that little bit of use (like weed eating our yard just along the street on our tiny lot) it blew up. Way to go black and decker. Way to go.\n\nAnswer:",

The cards are layed out and you start rolling the dice to win \"prizes.\" Even though you win one, it can be won from you by another player if they roll what is needed. The winner is the one with three prizes at the BEGINNING of their turn. This makes for a lot of passing and rooting for someone else. I like that.The only real draw-back to the game is that so many prizes are almost impossible to get and usually the same ones get tried for over and over again. This can make for a longer game than necessary. And, if you're playing with people who are not risk takers, the game gets a little slow and predictable.The low educational rating is due to the fact that the game doesn't require that player to do anything but count and remember.Overall, this is a great little game to buy for the whole family. This is not a good game for teens or a primarily adult crowd.\n\nAnswer:",

There are many excellent tracks on this album, but none match the strength of their originals (though con-cept's \"breath of life\" and philtron's \"when I needed you\" do come close). As with most electronic acts, the vocals are rather amateurish, and since Erasure's music translates really well into techno, the music becomes the star rather than the singer(s). I was disappointed to see that the covers only go as recently as \"Always\" (ignoring the past 2 albums completely), 4 (of the 10) covers are from the same album (Chorus), and there were no covers from Wild! If you like covers (I do) and love Erasure (oh yeah!) then you should definitely buy this album.\n\nAnswer:",

Only reason I gave it 1 star is because Big Boi had sense enough not to sellout and stuck to being OutKast while Andre tries to be the next Prince. But even Big Boi was barely even trying with his lyrics. The only good songs on Speakerboxx are \"The Way You Move\", \"Bowtie\" and \"Church\".I understand why Hey Ya was #1 on TRL so much, and that's because TRL is a pop video countdown. Dre has definetly sold out. If you wanna hear OutKast and their best, buy Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, ATLiens or Aquemini (Stankonia was alright, but not as good as their first three).

Although the story suffers under the bulk of espionage genre clichés, like for example \"no good suspense novel without a good romance\", the basic idea is refreshingly original.The story is told from the perspective of the German soldiers and this is a quite daring and enthralling viewpoint. In the end you are so in touch with the story and its characters that you start to hope that the Germans will succeed in their crazy mission.The pace of the narrative is quite slow for the first hundred pages, but this gives the reader the opportunity to get really involved into the lives of the main characters. This part can easily be compared with the depth reached in a John Le Carre novel. When the climax comes nearer the pace suddenly changes quite dramatically.

I was once a member of the United House of Prayer for All People for 14 years and unfortunately I didn't get a chance to see Daddy Grace. He died three years before I was born. Nevertheless the wonder about Bishop Grace thrived within me because of the stories my grandmothers told me. My grandmothers were loyal members of Bishop's Grace's church, joining in the early days, and filled my head with stories. They loved Daddy Grace. To be honest, when you interview members of the United House of Prayer for All People you get a one sided view, filled with legends about Bishop Grace. Mr. Davis' book lays out straightforward resources that examine the cult's founder. I didn't know there were so many articles, books, and dissertations written about Daddy Grace.

They would then market the end result as a 'live' (in quotes) recording, thus having the effect of a live recording, without the costs of putting on a concert. I suspect that this record is one such album. That aside, it has some brilliant songs, recalling the Soul Stirrers' golden era with Sam Cooke and R.H. Harris. I first had this on cassette tape in the 70's (which fell apart many years ago) and I search far and wide for it ever since.

It is the most magical, moving and haunting piece written for small orchestra and vocalists. The redemption scene at the end in which a madwoman's madness is absolved is of such beauty and power it leaves you breathless.However, this recording does not show the piece to it's full potential. The performances while vocally strong, have brash, harsh and annoying \"old men belting\" sounds. Even the wonderful Peter Pearce is not at his best here, where his performance of the madwoman is just too sane and slightly cold and nasal. Occasionally, the diction is unclear too (perhaps due to the nature of the piece), and the band/orchestra lacks flow, fluidity and sensitivity.However, I would still urge any enthusiast in 20th Century opera to buy this!\n\nAnswer:",

I've had them running for 24 hours and the only thing I have caught is a gnat or something with wings. I added these to my arsenal after discovering fleas a couple of months ago. I first tried Frontline on my two cats...no good. I then moved to the carpet/upholstery spray...not much good. I then added Program for my cats and used Capstar to kill the adult fleas. Capstar works great but doesn't last. I then moved to a carpet/floor powder. I still had fleas so ordered these Victor Traps. I vacuumed and washed everything every single day for the past two months. Either the fleas are finally gone or these things don't work.Update: 02/23/13. Still have fleas and have two of these traps which have not caught 1 single flea since I've had them out.\n\nAnswer:",

The special effects are better, the acting is improved, and the production values are obviously improved.Why only 2 stars? Simply put: what in the world is the movie about? If the producers feel that they are being faithful to Scripture, then they need help, badly. This movie's plotline wanders pretty far afield from anything I have ever read in the Bible, no matter how many drinks I have had beforehand. On the other hand, it suspiciously resembles any number of Tom Clancy (who, as far as I know, is in neither the Old or New Testaments) thrillers.Not as agonizingly awful as its predecessor, this movie nonetheless is in dire need of improvement.\n\nAnswer:",

Since many of the songs were the same, I took a chance that this import was a repackaging of singles.It's not. These are live performances taken off the radio - in fact they sound like they might have been recorded off the air. The sound is tinny and the editing is a bit rough (some songs cut off suddenly during applause, but on another you get to hear Jim clear his throat after a song).After all that though, the album has its charms. The tracks are all live and Jim introduces several of them. If you're a big Jim Reeves fan, this is a chance to hear him in a more open context than a studio album. Still, his voice without any bass does seem a bit of a waste.\n\nAnswer:",

Perhaps I should have worked that out by myself as well!!!Don't buy this book unless you are of below average intelligence or under the age of 17.\n\nAnswer:",

All the negative complaints such as wheels falling off (an impossibility with the current design) and that jams are hard to clear and time consuming (it takes about 2 seconds to open the magazine and remove the brads). There is only one complaint that was legitimate and that is getting up against the compressor that is hot and getting burnt. This too is almost an impossibility as only a minute portion of the compressor is not shielded by the plastic housing. The only complaint I can see is the noise of the compressor but in real use the compressor takes forever to kick on and doesn't take long to recover. The truth is that the compressor is better built than others and holds the air pressure even after weeks of setting unused. The brad gun is light and easy to use and easy to load...\n\nAnswer:",

Her partner is part-elf whose dog turns out to be bred to fight vampires. And ultimately our hero is also magical. The overall theme is that things are not what they appear to be and that our fantasies have a basis in reality.The authors do a fine job of crafting an interesting story.

From the get-go, the President's daughter Cassie witnesses a terrifying act and is silenced by fear and stubborness. Dr. Jessica is assigned to help her, as she has helped others in the past, and soon her sister Melissa and mysterious Micheal are involved. In the middle, the plot takes a turn and the reader is shocked in the way the characterization is shifted. The story unravels at times, and sometimes there is so much going on with the surface that you do not really get into the heart and meat of the novel. But it is a fast read and very entertaining.

All I can tell you is that watching Wally's show on Saturday nights is a bit like taking mushrooms: nothing makes sense.

Our cat lives outdoors (he adopted us) and there is fairly high traffic of feral cats, deer, squirrels and chipmunks, so we mainly have problems with fleas in the yard and garage. When we come into the house we'll always have a few 'passengers' come in with us. I've been using the Victor trap near the garage door and it usually gets a handful of fleas overnight. We have noticed a decrease in flea bites on ourselves, leading us to believe that the trap is a good supplementary defense. I do not, and would not, rely solely on the trap. I spray the garage, distribute granules on the yard and driveway, and use Advantage spot treatment for the cat.I have also found that a disposable plastic plate with a mix of a few drops of dish detergent in water, placed underneath a nightlight, is equally as effective as the Victor flea trap.\n\nAnswer:",

The story, itself, is a nice idea. Finding a message about a man's undying love for his wife would get most women and their libidos racing to find \"man with love expressive language.\" You can ask most single women, and I guess married ones too, how often they hear a man express his love, passionately, to them or anyone else. The answer will probably not surprise you so, when a woman senses this in a man, even if he is expressing it for another woman, said woman will want it, at any cost. Sparks mixes his metaphors, and continued to ignore the verb-object agreement. For the most part, the book read like it was done by a first-time, romance novelist.\n\nAnswer:",

Songwriter and guitarist Patrick Linton has soft vocals that are engaging as on \"Yellow Dusk,\" \"And though it seems that I am older, a thing I never wanted to be, and suddenly the world is golden, there is nothing left out there for me.\" \"Where I'm Going\" is a piano based road song like a pastiche of images, \"And I look into those eyes, we got such a long way to go.\" While not every track works equally well, the CD maintains interest because Linton has unique musical ideas and keeps trying different things.

This blu-ray version has some pluses, the first being how visually clear it is and how vibrant the colors are. It is definitely an up-grade from any standard DVD I have seen. Another plus are the featurettes, one on Gene Kelly which is well done and another on the making of this particular film. Both are very interesting. The only disappointment is the 1:33:1 format - or a standard format. This is a film which should have been done in widescreen - especially the dance sequence at the end. We are so spoiled by all the new productions of musicals in widescreen that it is too bad that this one was done before its time. However, lovers of Gene Kelly and musicals will most likely enjoy having this version in their collection.\n\nAnswer:",

I wish that the most recent edition of Collision Course had reviewed some of this new evidence. As an eyewitness to the historic event, and having survived it along with my family, I have researched much of the information available to nautical scientists, maritime lawyers, and survivors. Armed with the data which reveals the truth about the tragedy, I know longer believe previous explanations about what caused the collision.

However, he was still unable to add any ounce of musicallity to even the most lyrical of melodies in the Quate. His tone also does not reach the level of brilliance that his former teacher, Eugene Rousseau, shows on the Heiden \"Fantasia Concertante\" on his own CD. I would recommend this CD only if you are a young student who wants to play the pieces with a metronome and along with the CD at the same time, as Fischer does not know the meaning of musical nuance. Maybe he will ask himself whether or not it is time to stop recording and focus on teaching. I will praise Fischer for one thing, This CD does not hurt my ears nearly as much as the first. Happy listening!\n\nAnswer:",

Lehane is an icon, whose works have been SO stand-out, with his earlier works absolutely brilliant, especially Shutter Island (in my opinion his Kafka-esque masterpiece). Now this.... It can only be called a cop-out, an escape from the widespread criticism Shutter Island received (from doltheads); what he's done here, in this evocation of early 20th-c. Boston, is sort of an evasive action, it seems to me. Much as I've loved every one of Lehane's earlier works, this one was beyond me -- uninteresting period and place, and very uninteresting characters (with the possible exception of an imagined Babe Ruth in the first chapter). Hard as I tried, I had to give up on page 169. This kind of historical thing from someone like Lehane is like Hemingway doing a Barbara Cartland....................

To add to this reader's exasperation with this mysteriously superficial biography, Randolph Scott's adopted son states at several points that Randolph's life was much more complex than the son is willing to reveal out of respect to Randolph's wife and friends. My guess is that Randolph's family still controls what is by all accounts a fabulous estate; thus both their own as well as Randolph's privacy interests will live on. If the family will not cooperate with an effort to substantiate and compile a definitive biography, there is virtually no chance that the son will ever be able to tell us more.Nonetheless, my curiousity was relieved and I am grateful for crumbs.Alexander Witkowski\n\nAnswer:",

Not having the hard copy, I don't know if these errors are in the original publication but names are misspelled throughout as well as common words. These errors are repeated. Words such as intuition, unfortunately, prostitute appear as inmition, unformnately, prostimte, respectively. The architect of the Paris Opera is Charles Garnier but in the book is Gamier. There are many more of these errors.In addition to this, in the Kindle edition, plates are referred to but do not appear.

I was pleasantly surprised by \"Circus\", however, though in all essence, it's a toned down Tarantino wannabe with a British accent. \"Circus\" tries to be the ever-popular hip gangster crime film that was popular a while back, but it falls short a bit. The problem seems to be with the incredibly complex storyline. There is a new twist in the plot nearly every scene, so much that it becomes anticipated after a while. The purpose of maintaining suspense through this technique is lost somewhere, and the \"unexpected\" surprise angles seem to be nothing short of a gimmick. Despite this, I found \"Circus\" to be somewhat enjoyable; it held my interest through its entirety. Keep an eye out for Eddie Izzard and John Hannah.\n\nAnswer:",

Not that I expected much really. I have been constantly disappointed by these types of releases before. So far the only movie of this genre that has satisfied has been Human Traffic. This one and all others fall short.The problem with this one is that there is no character development. After 40 minutes, you still don't have any interest in them or what happens to them. The movie only gives you a glimpse into their lives for a moment and then you see them partying. Nothing else. Also, the foreshadowing is a bit much here. It isn't too hard to determine what is going to happen next in the film. If you have the money to spend and you HAVE to see it, then go ahead, but be warned that if you have seen any other crappy rave movie, then you have already seen this one.\n\nAnswer:",

Spend the extra money on a name that will stand behind their product, and one that will have a fair chance of repair if anything should happen in the future.

The numbers are all in the book. A caution ... the low calorie version of the diet has not resulted in much weight loss.

From the first moment the dialog began I cringed inside and any sliver of hope I had (even at this point), I knew was extremely wishful. The script was dreadful, it was reminiscent of someone you meet who upon trying to impress you, tries too hard, is a name dropper and talks incessantly about subjects you are informed of in a way that is immature and simply uncomfortable. If you are someone who understands the historical importance of Ada, this plot will be nothing but torture to you, and feel strikingly sacrilegious. This movie is not intelligent, but rather, it is insulting, has it's own agenda, takes credit for ideas that have been established by others, marries multiple plots into an annoying and badly acted overkill and is mostly disrespectful, as Ada's name has been used and defamed.\n\nAnswer:",

Harvey Danger is repetitive, annoying, and unimaginative. Not to mention WAY overhyped. If you want to be cool because you listen to Seattle music, then go up to that little search box in the corner and type in \"Goodness\" One listen to them and you'll see everything Harvey Danger did wrong. I am on an e-mail discussion group for Goodness, and there's more than one person on there who saw Harvey Danger back when they were periodically getting laughed off the stage. That was only a few years ago. It should still be happening now.\n\nAnswer:",

The only feature that i like I about this bag is that it does compact pretty well and its light. It is definately not a 30F bag. Last night it got down to 27F and with 6 layers of clothes, fleece-lined socks, thermal underwear, and a warm beany I still froze. I lay awake shivering all night. I used this bag on a five day trip in yellowstone during June. It got down to the low 50's, high 40's at night and there were a few nights I was chilly then, but could solve it by layering.Warmth is not the only problem. The zipper on the side is a horrendous design. It'll have you cussing even if that's not your style.

This is sad, as I feel that this period was one of the most creative for the band. \"Add Some Music To Your Day\" is one of the group's best. I was always a fan of the Holland album and was happy to see that the \"The Trader\" and \"California Saga\" were included. The covers of \"Peggy Sue\", \"Come Go With Me\" and \"California Dreamin'\" are surprisely enjoyable.

So I asked them how I was supposed to find out it didn't fit without opening the package. This is a wifi card, not a game or something that I could copy. So after I leave a bad review I suddenly have a return code in my e-mail from them. Now it has been nearly a month since I returned the item. They still have not returned my money, or given me a credit, sent me an e-mail, I have not heard from them at all. I will never shop with Digitalet again.\n\nAnswer:",

The writing is insipid, the constant preaching is tiresome, and the characters don't even begin to be believable. The other annoying thing is their trick of printing the book with huge margins, ultra-wide spacing, and large print. This was obviously just a trick to stretch 200 pages into 500.

None of the 12 samples that I tried to bring into a test project would run. All needed one to two hours of rework just to get going.

A large Group of people used to gather almost everyday to sit around and just drink. People in the story were always concerned about their self. All they thought about was sex and how they needed it all of the time. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have had to go through what he went through; .He didn't deserve all that. Jake was an innocent man who just wanted on thing, and that was Brett.This novel is very similar to modern day times. Sometimes people engage in drinking just to get away from their everyday struggles.. The time in which this novel took place and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for relief and have tendencies to party all night long. Yet, there are parts in the book I cannot believe can occur, but this may be a good part of the novel; A place where dreams may happen.\n\nAnswer:",

Remarkably this album was issued the same year as \"Return to Forever\" (1972) which may be why it never made it to the surface for many of us.This is a transcendent piece of music. There are many levels of melody created by enormous virtuosity of two musicians feeding off each other in an amazing interplay. The sound is excellent and the recording has plainly been remastered by someone who really knew that they were doing.

First of all, it was kind of odd how Heather and her father just went to an auction without a horse trailer, halter, or leadrope. I wasn't crazy about the illustrations, either. The ponies all looked like a cross between a Beanie Baby and a dragon. Apple, Heather's pony, actually had facial expressions! When two girls insulted Apple he frowned, and when Heather was patting or riding him, he smiled. It was cute, but sort of weird.Not counting the inacuracy of the horse facts and illustrations, it was a very cute book. Girls between six and ten would love it. Of course, for a little girl who is truly horse crazy and knows a lot about ponies already, I would reccomend a series like Bonnie Bryant's Pony Tails. They are full of accurate horse facts.\n\nAnswer:",

The powermatic was the winner. You can't go wrong with the 5 hp motor, fine machined table, steel machined crank locking knobs, bigger crank handles, rock solid fence. The saw came with a QA label showing arbor runnout, etc. I set it up in about 4 hrs and ran a machinist straight edge over the table. The saw measured out at .002 flatness, pretty good. You will need to buy a 10 ga wire, plug, etc to hook it up. The manual was clearly written. The saw has not been slowed down while cutting everything from ripping old hard oak to maple. Great piece of equipment. The only concern was the PM 66 had always used a 3VX belt to drive the pulleys and Amazon even advertised as such. However, when I received my saw it only has 2 belts and pulleys. This was very misleading in my view. Overall - good saw, but have had the saw for over a year and Amazon is still advertising the 3VX belt.\n\nAnswer:",

If you're learning SQL for the first time or want to know more than \"SELECT. . .FROM. . .WHERE\" then buy this book! It allows you to really understand how to create all kinds of queries, rather than just being able to write command strings. The authors break complex concepts down into easy to understand lessons. The content is comprehensive and sophisticated but presented in a very intuitive way. Learning SQL has never been easier. The only drawback--and it's not the authors' fault--since, unfortunately, different database programs use different SQL syntax, you will have to refer to the manual for your specific program for some command strings.

The image itself was clearly fuzzy with age and missing or brutalized frames weren't massaged digitally at all, as far as I could tell. Ten dollars isn't too much to pay for my favorite Cary Grant comedy, by any means, and I'm glad I have it, but when I get my home entertainment center in order, I surely hope to find these reviews to be true, because my experience with this disk was that it was as sloppy as many of those Image DVD's that came out right after the format was invented, and I felt it was misleading to release this disk with the gold banners and all the marketing trappings of some kind of special edition, when so much was messy.\n\nAnswer:",

As another reviewer has mentioned, given the fact that this book is now 22+ years old, some of the clues are dated, but they seem to have done a good job of choosing clues that have stood the test of time.All in all, this book and the Jeopardy!

Having recently acquired it again on CD, the only complaint I'm going to mention is with the recording, balance is occasionally off and there are fortissimo sections seemingly recorded at too high a level (the music seems to flare, or blare -- sorry if my terminology is askew). For those who have complained about the high price, I too put off this purchase due to cost. However (and I don't know if I can get away with stating this here), the recording is more widely available in Europe and you can acquire it via the web through European sellers whose prices are a good deal more reasonable. The service I used is a classical distributor out of Birmingham, England called Crotchet (the English term for a quarter-note); their service was impeccable and the price was approximately $43 U.S. Crotchet can be contacted through www.crotchet.co.uk.\n\nAnswer:",

This is a 1982 performance. My stupidity for looking at the 2005 notation and not realizing that it refers to the DVD release date. Also, and more importantly, the sound is Doly 2.0 (not 5.1). From an Audiophile standpoint, the sound quality is just not that good compared to other recordings. I also agree with the previous reviewer that the camera work is laughable. I've seen better video of my kids soccer games.

Instead the workman-like Freddie Francis steps in for old Terry(who was apprently sick at the time) And delievers a sort of quase-shawshbuckler-mad scientist movie. Not special or in-depth like Fisher's entries, but a fun sleazy gulity pleasure trip. Francis imbues the film with a gritty damp feel, quit unlike the earlier entrys or later ones, contrasted in John Wilcox's flat photogaphy. And Anthony Hinds's poorly scripted screenplay (one of his worst) manages to conjure up some absurd snappy diolouge, that will keep any Bad-cinema buff entertained.Unfortunetly this guilty treat is not avaiable in it's un-cut format, which consists of scense shot from TV upon it;s original TV airing. Though these cut, or added scenes (which ever you like to term them) can be seen on AMC, whenever they happen to air it.\n\nAnswer:",

I guess what I really love about Ani is her ability to take a simple melody, add a bunch of different instrumentals, creative lyrics, her emotional voice, some really unique chords and key changes and turn it into something complex, but not grating. I felt like only 2 songs on this album did that: Studying Stones and Paradigm. The rest of the tracks, I just didn't enjoy listening to because I didn't like the melodies. I don't have all of her albums (I have 8, I think) but this is the first one where I don't absolutely love at least 2/3 of the songs.

How did that happen?End of Story was very well written, with no hint of the protagonist's hesitant over-thinking (which I started looking for in Peter Abrahams'own work.) The plot moved well, and the locales were interesting. There was an air of humor in some of the scenes and the entire story just never lagged.In conclusion: surprisingly, I will read another of this author's books in hopes that he draws a character that I do not want killed.

I tried it on my 98 Grand Cherokee, a friends 2007 Sebring, and a 2008 300. The coupling tool didn't work for any of them.

Remember, it's plastic. Anyone who has done work with spring couplings will know that these won't last. If you're getting them for a one time fix (why I got these), they're good enough and cheap.

That seems to me was done only so there could be a sequel. I mean, the Greenwood massacre in Tulsa was in 1921 so it can hardly be coincidental that Luther and Lila are back there again at the end of the book as 1920 dawns.Lehane is very good I think in bringing out the human-ness of characters, flaws and good points, and the main characters were folks you turn the page for, to see what happens to them next. I was not as bothered by the Babe being there throughout, in many ways his struggles were a big part of what was going on in 1918-1919 Boston, and between workers and owners of the time. I'm glad he was part of this book.\n\nAnswer:",

But be warned that Dark Destiny is not what the first \"preview\" chapter makes it out to be.First, the book deals with issues that are more disturbing than informative. From child rape...to more sexual intense moments this book was gory to take for something that could entertain you.Secondly, after the 5th chapter the book goes into a depressing and repetitive tone that is just boring...the love tangle between the two characters does not seem authentic, more like forced by the author.I was really disappointed by the book, and will be more careful when choosing books in the future before reading reviews like this.People easily jump into conclusions that this is the greatest read in the world...but to be honest I put the book down too many times to allow that statement.I recommend that you BORROW or get the book from the library and preread some chapters to see where you stand...good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

I had probably come across that story not long before this one. This is a decent version, though the sales pitch at the end is disconcerting, and blares out soon after the story ends. I could enjoy a different telling and would have, except I thought that there would be some booklet wih this since that's what it looks like, right? The CD is packaged with a styrofoam sheet to make the package look more bulky, like maybe a booklet comes with it or something! Don't be fooled. There's nothing to this but the classic recorded short story, the box, and some styrofoam. And while it is the very one I listened to as a child, so it has a bit of nostalgia connected to it for me, it really is too much money for what it is.\n\nAnswer:",

But I do want to add that these are tight vocals, very seamless, smoothly melodious. (I'm not sure how the Elmer Fudd image came to Matt the reviewer, above, but it certainly couldn't have been from the SOUND of the Harmonists: overall, these guys are silk.) Also, the pianist that accompanies them has a deft way of supporting the vocals without overwhelming them or becoming underwhelming himself. It's a balancing act of pure magic. The Hannibal CD has superb sound quality (considering the age of these recordings)--it really sparkles--and great selections. This is music you can listen to when you're happy, when you're sad, when you want to do a little two-step for the heck of it, when you want to think. It's versatile. It's perfect. And, as the reviewer from Northampton said, it's sublime.\n\nAnswer:",

Though many stars can cross over from the sound that made their name, Rod isn't one of them. And this album of pop and jazz standards just comes off as an oddity, more curious than good.He should be singing \"Downtown Train\" or \"Infatuation,\" not songs better suited to Harry Connick, Jr. or Frank Sinatra. I know that, since his surgery, his voice isn't quite as capable of the power it used to contain, but these songs are hard to do well - and Rod's efforts, though noble, do neither he nor the music on this album the justice they deserve.There are some high points, but he's not able to sustain long notes on most of the songs, which harms the tempo as well as the tone.\n\nAnswer:",

Once you develop a wood allergy, it never goes away so I am very careful to use this mask.First, if you are going to wear a mask all the time, it has to be comfortable. The #8511 is soft and with the adjustable nose-fit feature, it conforms snugly to the contours of my face. The two elastic straps provide snug but not over-tight contact and, with a little care, I get a close enough fit so that my exhalations do not fog up my safety glasses. The masks are durable and I typically can wear one all day, every day for several weeks (as long as I don't sneeze while wearing it!).The masks appear to effectively remove even fine sanding dust as the inside remains clean and I have developed no allergies after many years of usage.Thanks for another fine product 3M!ROD\n\nAnswer:",

Yet, when everyone who has been urging her into these romantic nightmares gives up on her, there is a strange let down until she discovers that Fate is willing to give her one last chance. Her \"Marley\" is the ghost of an old woman with the unlikely name of Mrs. Batty Smith, who informs her that three spirits will visit her to encourage her to change her ways. Cupid, aka, Valentines' Past, is sort of cute, albeit irksome. Valentines' Present is the ideal man, one that readers who like to play the book as a movie in their head will want to hit pause on when he comes around. The spirit of the Future- we won't go there. Suffice it to say, she outdoes Christmas Future on the scary level.

Now at 1 1/2 years it shuts down constantly. The problem - OVERHEATING. Apparently it's a well known problem, and I can't get any support from Sony.

The man who stars in this video may know a lot about fighting and martial arts, but when he picks up a whip, he reminds me of Joe Piscopo from the karate movie, Sidekicks. This whip instructor looks like he is just swinging wildly about as he attempts to show different strikes with the whip. In theory he has some good information, but the execution is less than poor. In comparison with several other cracking videos I recently received, the professional crackers show much more finesse and fluid movement and frankly I would be much more frightened to attack one of them than this guy. As I said, he really knows how to fight, but I would recommend he take some lessons on how to crack and then re-shoot his video. I was disappointed with this video.\n\nAnswer:",

It is simple to install provided one measures carefully and has on hand the basic tools recommended. All the needed hardware was enclosed to make it possible to mount this bracket to wall studs or to a concrete wall (glad I did not have to do the latter installation though). Once the bracket is in place, you can adjust your viewing angle up to 12 degrees and have a bit of room for lateral positioning the TV as well. My son and I successfully installed both the bracket and TV in less than an hour, and much of that time was spent measuring and positioning before we committed to a location.\n\nAnswer:",

I was thoroughly awed by the beauty and majesty of the park but was disappointed by the crowds that I just couldn't get away from. I was hoping that Hawks Rest would give me insights into the \"real\" world of Yellowstone.Given these expectations, the book truly did satisfy my purposes and I was pleased. But it also turned into a political screed. Although I very much believe in Ferguson's cause of alerting the public to the abuses of the elite hunting culture in Yellowstone, I feel that he devoted too much of this book to this cause. Hawks Nest is subtitled A Season in the Remote Heart of Yellowstone. I wish this, rather than promoting a political agenda, had been the focus of the book.\n\nAnswer:",

Mind you that this was her first time playing, and I thought that maybe it was a little early. Don't get me wrong I think that the game itself is set up pretty good, (will need Mom or Dad to help get started). She is 4 now, we recently played and she managed the controller a lot better but still got upset at the game as she didn't know where to head next. She tended to gravitate to the Mini games that are geared more for short term playing.Overall: The game is something that I plan to keep and offer her to play ever so often in hopes that she can master the use of the controller better!\n\nAnswer:",

The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are quite well drawn. One of the best aspects of the novel is the vantage point from which it is written.The reader learns everything through Elizabeth Bennet's point of view and sees the world through her prejudices. The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Its influence on English literature and its continued appearance in popular culture alone make it worth reading.Trev @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com\n\nAnswer:",

I failed to appreciate the \"omnipresence of the cow\" and found some of the scenes gruesome. The beauty of the film escaped me because of the disturbing and disturbed characters. Definitely not an \"entertaining\" movie. This one is strictly for the connoisseur.\n\nAnswer:",

I have tried several recipes and have found all are easy to prepare and the book gives great instructions. Most of the recipes are from northern states but easily fit into any regional church dinner. When I serve recipes from this book to guests at my home I always get compliments and requests for copies of the recipes. Makes a great addition to any cookbook collection.\n\nAnswer:",

So-and-so goes to the bathroom. So-and-so puts her hand on his shoulder. So-and-so stares forlornly at the painting. Not only that, but the payoff is bankrupt. At least with the plot-shallow \"Da Vinci\" we have a sprint and come across the finish line feeling like we accomplished something. With \"Historian,\" the only thing we accomplish is burning a few calories for having to carry around a tome of this size.Kostova needs to learn how to do a little more plot blooming as it happens, instead of waiting entirely until the end. It's okay to reveal key facts and let the audience know that they're key as they happen, instead of just rehashing the same facts over and over ad nauseum to string us along until the end. She needs fewer words, a better editor, and a sense of pacing.Verdict: good for weigh lifting, bad for entertainment.\n\nAnswer:",

This is an offbeat drama that offers many funny and touching moments. The story is a little slow but and easy to follow. The scenery on the Jersey Shore is beautiful and creates a peaceful mood for this love story. Dennis Fecteau gives a touching performance as Micki's terminally ill uncle. This is one the better lesbian films I have seen in a while.\n\nAnswer:",

With half the number of entries of other dictionaries, no pronunciation key for entries, no etymology and extremely bare bones definitions, this dictionary is completely useless.
