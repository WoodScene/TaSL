The storytelling is incoherent and impossible to follow at places, it goes off on utterly disconnected tangents, and seemingly ignores all basic conventions of good story telling. While certain leeway has to be given due to the story's premise, this story takes that leeway, rips it open, rapes it, and skips rope with it.Some enjoyable parts, such as Lucifer's recollections on Heaven and Eden, made me keep reading, but only to be terribly disappointed with the story as a whole. IF you're looking for a good read, or even a read that makes sense, do not turn to read this book.\n\nAnswer:",

This place is important because this is the school Harry Potter will learn his ways in using magic. He will also about his past in this place.This book is mostly about Harry Potter as one of the main characters of the story showing him about his past and how he learns and the games he plays at Hogwarts. Two other characters are Harry's friends which help him get through the year, as well as Harry helping them get through the year.In my opinoin I think Harry Potter must of been real famous because everyone knew of him. The book is interesting because of the way they learn magic and how sometimes messed up. I gave the book 2.5 stars because sometimes it got intresting and sometimes boring.

The handle is too long, so to grab things you have to grip closer down on the handle, which means your hand ends up closer to the grill flame. There also didn't seem to be much \"give\" in the tongs' hinge, which made gripping food difficult.

He can never let the evidence speak for itself. He always has to comment on it.

I think the main thing was that you didn't see how they fell in love, what made them love each other. You could see they had passion, but you didn't really get to know them all that much.

I remember saying \"No wonder opera won't go away after 400 years\" when experiencing this for the first time. Mozart's penchant for making all the characters, no matter what side of the conflict they are on, completely irresistable. You'll want all these delightful folks to get their way. (except, perhaps, the Count!) Very well photographed, in a simple, yet elegant set. Szymtka, while not a natural beauty, aces the two suductive arias. And, her 'letter duet' with the Contessa will melt you into a puddle. I have seen 3 other versions of her role that don't come close. Furlanetto, as Figaro, is exceptionally fun to watch and hear. The rest of the well-balanced cast fills in nicely, to fill the 3 hours with more comedy, poignant moments, drama, and great music than seems possible. Out of about 80 versions of various operas I have seen so far, this is still my favorite.\n\nAnswer:",

If that was the only issue, I would recommend these SuperFi 5 Pro earphones. But the deal killer here is the cord. To allow the user to shape the cord over the top and behind the ear, there is a flexible wire in the cord. It's a good idea, but poorly executed. I've had to replace the cord twice in 18 months (they run $20 plus tax/shipping). If you plan on using the small aluminum carrying case to carry it around while traveling, those wires will be bending all the time. And don't look for any sympathy from Ultimate Ears (now Logitech) if they break right after the end of the one year warranty. If you buy these earphones, plan on spending money on periodic cord replacement.For these reasons I can't recommend this product.\n\nAnswer:",

However, the visuals are spectacular and gives the technothriller junkies out there some new toys to chew on, such as the Talon jets (based on the Northrop Grumman Switchblade design), the AGM-2 Truncheon implosion bomb (the ultimate surgical weapon, as it can cause a building to collapse on itself without any real collateral damage), and the Camel Hump inflight refueling blimp. You're probably better off renting it or buying it used from Blockbuster.\n\nAnswer:",

Even though it had been highly recommended by my son, the immensity of the thing was intimidating. However, once I began reading I became lost in the world of Mr. Martin's fantasy. His style of writing is so lyrical it was captivating. The plot and characters, though many in number, were presented in such a fashion that I found myself wishing I could speed read! This was the first book I read on my new Kindle. Once I realized how simple it was to retrieve a definition of an unknown word, I was even more enthralled.In summary, it is a great story written in a beautiful way...enough said.\n\nAnswer:",

It concerns a present-day doctor who is plucked into the future by a tribe of Indians with time-travel technology. In their world the healing arts have been lost, since the ideal of dying to make room for an improved breed of humanity has displaced the value of living one's own life. The Indians, however, are inspired by a fanatical and paranoid leader, who is lying mortally wounded, on whom they wish the doctor to operate. In his effort to save the man, the doctor is thrust into a series of ingenious time paradoxes, which can be seen as a warm-up for the far richer novels Martian Time-Slip (1964) and Now Wait for Last Year (1966).\n\nAnswer:",

I would love to read the story of his childhood, and rise to power on the streets of Calimport. Of course Drizzt is still the man however. His ongoing romantic triangle with Cattie-Brie and Wulfgar (why couldn't he stay dead...I mean until this book he was so cliche) remains an cornerstone in the series. NO MORE DRIZZT-ARTIMIS fights.

The only stories that really caught my attention were the Glen David Gold, the Elmore Leonard, and Chabon's own contribution. Neil Gaiman's story was particularly disappointing. It looked like something he tossed together in an afternoon. The mainstream writers should stick to mainstream stuff.

My main issue with the book is that I kept wanting more. I wanted more depth about Esperanza and the other characters Cisneros introduces us throughout the vignettes.After I finished the book, I felt like I do after having a meal at a restaurant where the appetizer is delicious and then you get just an average entree.

However, my first attempt yielded a machine with a left-side lever that did not work. My second attempt yielded one which burned the top of the bread while leaving the bottom untoasted. For some reason I persevered, and the third attempt brought me one that is satisfactory, although the browning is still somewhat uneven. The toast has a nice crispy exterior, and the features on the toaster are very good. I have given it a 3 star rating rather than a 4 star rating, because I think that Krups needs to pay more attention to its quality control and insure that every item shipped conforms to the same high level.\n\nAnswer:",

The movie was made on a pretty low budget, but the lighting and camera work, as in all Orson Welles films, is fantastic. It's a very dark, gloomy, foggy black-and-white look. I especially liked the scenes with the three Weird Sisters, the witches who tell Macbeth of his fate.The acting is, of course, excellent. Welles really understands Shakespeare and he shows it in his performance as Macbeth. Lady Macbeth is also very good, Jeanette Nolan.\n\nAnswer:",

I picked it up chiefly due to a reference Scorsese makes to it in A Personal Journey. Certainly, Divorce Italian Style is a farce but the emotions and events it contains are ones with which all of us can relate--even though none of us have a need for a Italian \"divorce.\" One also can appreciate the mystique which European films had--as compared to the more stodgy state of American cinema--during that period. I've always loved Marcello Mastroianni and his efforts here are outstanding. He plays his role perfectly and is a figure of both contempt and admiration. All of the acting, however, is great. The plot unwinds slowly but does not end predictably (on the whole). The climax is nuanced and the last frame tells us much about the nature of men and women.\n\nAnswer:",

I actually really enjoy a bunch of songs on this album, but I cannot say I enjoy it as an album. Some songs, which are there just for humor's sake get rather annoying after a couple of listens. the inevitable, doot doot pause - skip song, occurs...and then we discover that the album isn't long at all. Other songs are just so great, gloves, something I'm not, all of the actual song songs. Great songs, and you will definetly find a place for them on your mix tapes, or cds if you're technically hip, but as far as an album goes, meh - I can't give it the five that some of these songs deserve.\n\nAnswer:",

Unlike every other USB hard drive with the Sony drive you can't simply drag and drop your existing MP3 and WMA music files to it. You must first load the Sony software, and then it goes through and converts all of you music files to Sony proprietary format. Now every time you want to add more music you need to download it then convert it. The software is not user friendly and converting file formats is simply a waste of time. I guess the Sony Music people got their hands a hold of this and wanted add protection for themselves and avoid losing licensing fees. Very annoying!!\n\nAnswer:",

Good setting. And an intresting premise of stealing 50,000 dollars. It takes a while for the plot to build meticusesly, it really starts to pick up after you're two thirds into it, it starts to climax, and then nothing happens...it seems like Leonard just got bored with it and coped out.

After listening to the whole album a couple of times, its easy to see who where the predecesors of great bands like Sleater-Kinney, or rocking out long before PJ Harvey came along.This record is sheer energy...The only downfall is its obscure mood which barely leaves the atmosphere...This album is less refined than \"Nature Film,\" but is certainly a couple of steps beyond it.I recommend it to any Indie, Alt, or classic Grunge fan who doesnt mind a less than great voice that still manages to rock you off your feet.\n\nAnswer:",

Amazing song.Only One:5/5; I think it's their 2nd single. This one sounds like a song for the troops at Iraq. Great message. Great slow song.Way Away:5/5( from what I heard); I heard someone sayin that this one was their first single. This song was why I gave this album 4 stars. I never heard the whole thing. Great song from wat I heard, but only fair if I listen to the whole thing.Well, thats it for now. Id better go buy this and make a real review!\n\nAnswer:",

There is an interesting story with unique characters and some memorable set pieces. Unfortunately the author goes on long tangents about marine life and technology without warning. It seemed like whenever things were getting interesting the story would abruptly stop. The sad part is that not all the facts presented here are true, and the author spends the bulk of the book throwing fact after fact at the reader. Honestly, any reader would be better off buying a biology textbook and some other fiction novel of their choosing.

But as he was featured in songs with 50 cent and others before this album dropped, his lyrical delivery style or flow seemed to have changed, almost to a wanna be tupac style, almost whiney at times. Practically the only song that has a good flow from eminem on encore is \"Mockingbird\". If this cd has flows like that with the same exact beats I would easily rate it with 4 stars. \"Mosh\" is clearly the best track, which has a good flow, good beat, and good focus. Other than that song it seems repetitive. His chorus' are weak and corny and last too long. He obviously still possesses the same lyrical skills but this isn't a cd that you can love almost any track on (like the previous 3). Overall, you can look at this as a good cd but compared to his previous efforts it is definitely weak in comparison...by far\n\nAnswer:",

One of the reasons, is that you can adjust the base reponse with the Coby, whereas with the Boze, that can't be done.

Knowing that any warranty coverage would only buy be 3 months more time before the next machine failure, I opted to have my father weld the support beam back in place, which held up....until the RIGHT foot support beam broke 3 weeks later. I had that one welded as well thinking I was out of the woods...WRONG. a month after that, the right inner support beam broke straight off the axle. After that, I gave up and burned the damn thing straight to hell in a bonfire behind my dad's storage unit. Cheap parts = DONT BUY!

There is also a more serious side to the novel where Twain uses Huck to learn the evils of society that the story takes place in. Through Huck, Twain tells his opinion of slavery and shares his own moral values. Because this is a realistic book, Twain can convey his thoughts and morals to readers of every level, not just highly educated scholars. Using realism, Twain lets people know how he thinks and shows that people can change. Realism is utilized to allow all people to be able to relate and understand what is going on in the novel.

Of course it's easy to look back in time and say, \"they should have done this\" or \"shouldn't have done that\". These were very poor people to begin with, they saw a market hungry for their output and a government anxious to encourage their production. Contour plowing and turning under the topsoil were not issues they would have been concerned with in the environment they labored. In fact, the solutions from FDR did not reverse the problems which even Egan admits still exist. This is a very well-written, and well-researched book despite Egan's rush to judgement.\n\nAnswer:",

And if only James Spader didnt look 30, I would say he was perfectly cast as well. Ringwald and McCarthy did alright with their parts, not great, but not badly either.

Arriving in Los Angeles, the girls quickly decide to re-invent their old dinner theatre musical act, and pose as drag queens in a struggling cabaret bar.This movie is actually quite delightful. Vardalos and Collette make an irresistible comedy team, and the girls actually sung all their numbers themselves (Collette starred on Broadway in THE WILD PARTY). Debbie Reynolds turns in a hilarious cameo (belting out \"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\", Rizzo's big number from GREASE), and the supporting cast, led by David Duchovny, Stephen Spinella and Dash Mihok is sensational.For musical theatre fans, CONNIE AND CARLA is highly-recommended.\n\nAnswer:",

I never really got the feeling that HE knew what he wanted in a relationship. I didn't think he a was wimp, his character displayed a warm and sensitive man, just unsure about the best direction for his personal life. Some people take longer to mature than others, it was as if he was waiting for something to happen. The story was a little slow in spots, I was surprised since he determined that Faye was his 'soulmate', that he never even tried to locate her. Don't know if I like Faye's getting pregnant but, realisticly things do happen. The book showed a lot of strong Black men, that was a plus. I really did enjoy reading this book.\n\nAnswer:",

Certainly has its weaknesses, characterisation is maybe not so strong, and the much vaunted \"hard science\" still relies on \"deus ex machina\" plot devices such as stargates (!) and miracle anti-ageing treatments not seen since the old testament. However, the \"idea density\" is so high that you would expect some duffers. Also, since I stayed up til 340am to finish it, I have to give it 5 stars! Author's misanthropic, Malthusian outlook does become a bit tedious at times but overall great speculative fiction.Incidentally, I have not read part 1 (Manifold: Time) and as far as I can see Manifold: Space is self-contained, however other readers who have read both may like to comment on this.\n\nAnswer:",

He had used TV Ears which worked well for a while but then died. These JVC headphones are comfortable and the sound qualify is good (better than the TV Ears) so probably would be good for use by those without hearing loss. BUT the maximum volume on these JVCs is too low. At max volume level the volume was good for me (no hearing loss) but no help for my dad. Also it's not easy to place the unit on the stand to engage the battery charger on the base unit. Headphones have to be placed with the correct orientation (charging port only on one side of the headphones) and correct angle. Finally, instructions say that batteries take 30 hours to fully charge and that you shouldn't recharge the batteries until they are depleted otherwise will shorten life. TV Ears could be placed on base for recharging anytime headphones not being used.\n\nAnswer:",

Abraham Lincoln supported a move to draft Confederate prisoners of war languishing (and often starving) in Northern prisons, with the stipulation that they would not have to go South and fight fellow Confederates. The \"Galvanized Yankees\" (so named because it was thought that their loyalty to the North was only a thin \"ganvanized\" layer) -- 6,000 of them, took the oath of loyalty to the Union and headed West to guard stagecoaches and mail routes. Numerous fights with Plains Indians, bitter cold, at lonely outposts were but a few of the hazards the Galvanized Yankees faced. My gg grandfather survived all this and returned home in 1866. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning more about these brave men who chose service to the Union rather than almost certain death in Northern prisons.\n\nAnswer:",

It was historically accurate and portrayed \"Stonewall\" Jackson as a very Christian man, which he was. There was no profanity in the movie which was representative of the times in the 1860's. It was unbiased and only revealed both sides of the conflict from the North and South's perspective. Although it had a 12-minute intermission, I wanted the movie to keep flowing without any interruptions. I was never bored and the battle scenes were amazing. Stephen Lang deserves to win some kind of award for his portrayal of \"Stonewall\" Jackson. He was fantastic. Terrific movie! I can't wait for the DVD to come out.

So rewrote email again - no response.Called tech support and left my number - no response.Again called sales and got another person.Got a live body - Yaaahoo! - could not help but forwarded me to customer service (to give me the service at home number). Customer service could not help and said Tech support were the ones to talk to. After an hour plus on hold I get to talk to a tech. 1/2 hour later he came to the conclusion that I needed service.The support issue is really bad.

I thought this sounded like an awesome story - people getting lost in the jungle, trying to survive off the land. First off, I am okay with the \"supernatural,\" but this is simply absurd. This is 15+ hours listening to (or reading) a story about people who have no chance. As bored as I was, I couldn't help but anxiously anticipate finding out how the story would end. I was disappointed.Let me put it to you this way. The story got dumber dumber as it went on. Just when I thought I had heard the stupidest thing, the author thought of something else to trump it. Really, this is really that bad. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because nothing is as bad as a John Saul novel (see my other reviews). This story is very farfetched, dragged out, not far from boring and more than anything, very, very depressing.\n\nAnswer:",

If you do read well (and by this, i mean are not a complete moron) then this book is a huge waste of time and you will really learn nothing. The best thing I learned from this book offered another paradox. It says to learn to recognize books that are not worth your time and effort and do not give them that effort.

Billed as the raunchiest film since Bad Santa, my expectations were high. As far as I'm concerned, the raunchier the better, but seldom is a film that calls itself raunchy, actually raunchy. Cameron Diaz was terrific, but the story was extremely weak. There is zero character development, I wanted to punch most of the supporting cast, and as far as being funny, it's only good for a snicker here and there. It's a predictable story about a gold digger seeking money to get plastic surgery. Parts of it are painful and the rest of it is just really stupid. Honestly, if it wasn't for the use of the F word, this movie would be rated PG-13 at best. Diaz is a fantastic actress and the story had so many possibilities, but they were all overlooked. The result, another mediocre, overrated, comedy billing itself as raunchy.\n\nAnswer:",

It was interesting to see the love triangle byplay, but it also put the hero in a bad light because he looked like an idiot for being in love with the un-worthy other woman for most of the book. She seriously made him look like a fool. I see that some of my friends have this book on their cheating and rake shelves, but there were no cheating in this book and the hero was definitely not portrayed as a rake. The kiss that took place between him and the other woman was forced upon him by her. He was just an honorable man that was still in love with his ex, but in no way was he a rake or cheated. I guess if you count emotional cheating as infidelity, then yes he was guilty of that. It was my first DP and an ok read for me.\n\nAnswer:",

It has different heads that you can use on different parts of the back, and part of the handle adjusts to the motion (kind of like in some tooth brushes). He loves it and the heat is also a nice feature.The reason why I gave it 3 starts, it's because of the vibration given out by the massager, my hand gets a funny sensation, it's not too pleasant. The same applies if you're massaging yourself. So my recommendation have someone do it for you, so you can relax and enjoy.So in general for the price of 16 bucks it's a good product to have.\n\nAnswer:",

I haven't exactly dunked the watch in a sink of water either, but for some reason the crispness of that button press is gone and now I have to try a few times whenever I want to get it to work.The heart rate sensor chest strap isn't too comfortable either, and it does take a little time with the manual to figure out.

The author criticizes alternative theories of Jesus from the presupposition that his own understanding of Jesus is the only valid one. He does not attempt to justify his own position, simply assumes to be a defender of the \"real' Jesus, while supporting orthodox Christian doctrine at the same time. He is oblivious to the obvious truth that the intellectual bankruptcy of conventional Christian doctrine leads people to search for new explanations of Jesus. Those who share his preconceptions will enjoy this read. Others will not.\n\nAnswer:",

There are far too many pictures of the same people/families, with a clear favoring of the Ellender family. At times I felt like this was just an Ellender family album. I do realize that the archives were a source for many of the pictures, but for a $20 book perhaps there should have been more research done and contributions from other families should have been solicited, accepted and used.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm about 10 miles from the towers, have the thing aimed directly at them from my first floor living room, and we go from no signal to a signal that cuts out every 10 seconds or so. This might be owed to the topography. Personally, I prefer no signal at all, since you at least don't sit there watching and hoping.\n\nAnswer:",

Since the day they got to the island, Moose did not like it. He made some friends on the island who got him in trouble many times. At school he became involved in a scam. The trick was to say that if you pay him he will get Al Capone to wash their clothes which takes an unexpected turn .[you'll find out when you read it.] When one afternoon Moose sees a prisoner with his sister he immediately reacts.

However, if you are the ELP fan, you will think,\"Why isn't Tarkus in here, or The Endless Enigma, or Hoedown, or Take a Pebble, or...(and the list goes on and on). If you want a better \"Best of\", go for \"The Best of Emerson Lake & Palmer\" or \"ELP: The Atlantic Years\".PROs: You get the great acoustic songs: Lucky Man, From the Beginning, Still... You Turn Me On, and C'est La Vie. And you get great rock songs like Pirates, the full Fanfare For The Comman Man, Knife-Edge, Karn Evil 9 1st Impression Part 2, Jerusalem, and Trilogy.CONs: It lacks a lot of songs. Also, the live versions here aren't all that great. An ELP fan would know why this is not \"The Very Best Of Emerson Lake & Palmer\".Look for better \"Best of\"s than this one.\n\nAnswer:",

This information is doing children around the world, desperately waiting for a family, a huge disservice. How awful that this false information is in a best selling book. People up to age 60 can easily adopt, as can singles, the handicapped, homosexuals, and people with large families. Much of the information is also borrowed from the not-for-profit book, \"The Report on Intercountry Adoption\", which is updated yearly. I could have been done a lot better.

The main concentration is on the preparation and presentation of radio shows, and the detail to this end is quite deep. If you were interested in the workings of early radio show then I think you would find this book to be compulsive reading.Due to the great detail provided in describing the radio side of the story, something had to be neglected and in this case it turned out to be the mystery. Any progress made by Jordan Ten Eyck / Jack Dulaney in solving the disappearance of two men was made with wild hunches based on very little evidence which always happened to yield results. I found this \"luck\" very unlikely and found myself growing increasingly frustrated with that aspect of the story. Rather than expecting a mystery, expect a story of the day to day running of a radio studio and it's importance to the cultural growth of America during the Second World War.\n\nAnswer:",

These peeks at how the glitterati and the grandees shuffled off their mortal coils and bequeathed their worldy possessions is revealing, amusing, sometimes noble and heartening and other times demeaning and peevish. These wills may not be for you, but they remind you that we all enter and leave this plane in a similar, if not identical fashion and the stuff, such as it is, that we accumulate in this realm, is no more than what dreams are made of, but, in our society, must be attended to.
