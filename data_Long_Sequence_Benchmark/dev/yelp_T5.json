I blame the campus leaders and planners, mainly the president, because they supposedly just remodeled it.  The selection is among the most limited I've ever seen @ a major research institution.  You want a burger, you're going to get a burger, you want a salad, you get a salad, you want pizza, you get pizza; nothing extraordinary, cheap quality at best!  I pity the students that waste their money on a meal plan here when they can literally eat right across the street for a fraction of the cost and get good quality and selection.

The goat cheese salad featured some tasty onions and tart goat cheese, but the dressing was lacking in flavor and it definitely didn't live up to the expectation that several \\\"yelpers\\\" had set.  The salmon entree was spot-on, and the relish topping popped with incredible flavor.  Finally, the chocolate pudding was decadent and the perfect end to the meal.  \\n\\nMy only complaint was the service.  Our waitress appeared to be in a less-than-enthusiastic mood from the start.  She rushed our drink orders within 30 seconds of being seated, required that we order appetizer, entree, and dessert all at once, failed to refill drinks, and then made errors on our receipts.  I love enjoying a fancy meal out, but there is simply nothing more frustrating than sub-par service.\\n\\nFor more details, including pictures, you can read my complete review.\\nhttp://trifoodiemd.blogspot.com/2013/01/carpe-diem-restaurant.html\n\nAnswer:",

In fact, this area of town that was previously mainly coffee and sandwich shops now boasts Tuk Tuk Indian food, The Hanging Bat Americana pulled pork, thai restaurants, the Three Birds for seasonal local Scottish fare, so it's nice to see some Japanese food make this corner of Edinburgh even more delicious.\\n\\nI preface all reviews of sushi restaurants by noting the difference between sushi in the UK, and sushi in California / Australia / Japan itself. Good sushi in the UK and Edinburgh can be very, very good -- but it'll never be the same quality, and value for money, as in the Cali / Japan. Here the UK you'll pay \\u00a325 for enough sushi to feed you for dinner, and it's seen as a delicacy -- not the other way around where you pay $15 and get as much sushi of the highest quality that you can eat, with some beef on the side for good measures. It's just how it goes here.\\n\\nSo with that in mind, Harajuku Kitchen is good sushi, that will satisfy your sushi-cravings in the Burgh, although it is pretty pricey and can leave a wee hole in your pocket without feeling overly full (as is often the way of sushi and value for money).\\n\\nThe sushi they do is lovely. A nice range, with some interesting things I haven't seen before. I went with some rainbow rolls, and mackerel nigiri -- nicely presented on a big plate. My dining partner had a piece of fish in sauce, so there are option that are not-raw and more cooked meals which might suit other palates too.\\n\\nA nice wee restaurant, nice wee sushi pieces, would definitely come back and its a nice fresh addition to the neighbourhood.\n\nAnswer:",

Located right across the way from Jean Philippe Patisserie and on the casino route.\\n\\n2. The bar itself was open seating when we got there on a Friday night.\\n\\n3. For the life of me, I cannot remember a deliciously fruity drink that my girlfriend loved, but if I recall it was the highlight of our time at the bar.\\n\\nI've had drinks at both Bar Moderno and City bar and I would heartily tell people to head to City Bar rather than Bar Moderno. Though Bar Moderno is definitely for those wanting to be seen or for people watching, City Bar just has better service and better drinks. I don't believe we were ever ignored by the waitress in the very busy room.\\n\\nThere was a drink that made a great impression on my girlfriend. It was a fruity drink that was very delicious. Overall, this was a great place to take her since we needed suggestions for cocktails that she would want to drink. The cocktail waitress hit the nail on the head with the suggestion and kept us in good spirits through the night.\\n\\nThe only reason this place isn't a five star spot is that it is much harder to feel like you're in the middle of all the action since it is slightly closed off. Still, I would probably head back to City Bar before heading down the way to Bar Moderno again.\n\nAnswer:",

The food is good (not incredible, but a solid good) with large portions (I never finishe a meal). Very American style rather than traditional food with the typical dishes - tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc. They go heavy on the cheese - it doesn't bother me, but it has bothered folks I have gone with. Otherwise, it is good food I am glad to eat.\\n  The service was incredibly fast. Tonight, a Friday evening, they were packed, yet we ordered, ate and chatted, and were out the door in less than 40 minutes. Staffers were there whenever my glass was low, but weren't in our faces all the time.\\n  The prices are medium - you're looking at $10-20 per person depending on what you order.\\n   The restaurant itself is pretty decent. The decor is pretty American Mexi-style, with obligatory bright colors and wood furniture. It's not a quiet place, but it isn't real loud - just active.\\n  Short story is, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but am perfectly happy to stop in.\n\nAnswer:",

I wasn't expecting a whole lot, however, since it was the East Valley, and the first thing I noticed was the lack of an actual sushi bar and visible sushi chefs.  Plus, there was techno music playing.  I HATE when they do that.  Sorry, but I want an authentic experience, complete with Japanese dudes chopping up my fish in plain sight, and 15th century Japanese music with pan flutes and hand drums or whatever they use.  A samurai trained in the bushido tradition standing by the door in order to slice up unruly guests would also be a nice touch, but I'll give them a pass on that one.\\n\\nAnyways, we sat down at the table, and started with the miso soup.  This was some of the strongest miso I've had.  It was almost like they were trying too hard.\\n\\nSo, I wasn't real hopeful, although they had some nice cuts of fish on the menu... Halibut, toro, uni, etc... Nothing crazy, but still some good stuff.  Unfortunately, they were out of all the interesting stuff.  The live specials were only available on weekends, and by Monday, they were all out.  Cool that they have them, but unfortunate that we couldn't actually try them.\\n\\nI also wanted to try the beef tataki sashimi style, but for some reason, it was only available in nigiri.  Why?  You can put a strip of seared beef over rice, but you can't serve them alone?  This did not make sense to me.\\n\\nWe ordered a couple of the special sashimi items - some hamachi dish whose name I don't recall, and the Screaming \\\"O\\\" - as well as white tuna sashimi, albacore sushi, red snapper sushi, surf clam sushi, and the Sixty Nine Roll.\\n\\nThe hamachi was overly stepped in citrus.  I mean, it was so citrusy that you were basically eating lemons with the texture of raw fish.  I'm the kind of guy who likes to taste fish when he eats fish.\\n\\nThe Screaming \\\"O\\\" was pretty good, despite its overpowering spice and marinade.  Also masked the tuna flavor, but it was a seared dish, so it wasn't as bad.  It would have been better had they dialed it down a notch, but it was still tasty.\\n\\nThe sushi and sashimi was typical.  Basically what you'd expect from a standard sushi place.\\n\\nSixty Nine Roll was pretty good.  It is basically softshelled crab and shrimp tempura on the inside and fish (I believe it was the standard tuna, yellowtail, and salmon) on the outside.  Good filler to finish off the meal.\\n\\nFinally, we ended with some tempura ice cream and tempura cheesecake for dessert.  The cheesecake was nice and thick, but also pretty much frozen and impossible to cut with a spoon.  The tempura batter was all wrong; it was thick and crunchy, not light and flaky like tempura is supposed to be.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I decided that this place is good for what it tries to be.  Its appeal is not for those who love sushi.  It's sushi for people who probably like to eat at Chipotle, Zupas, or whatever the newest trendy chain place is, but every now and then want to eat some raw fish.  It has enough to perhaps expand the horizons for those who don't often eat sushi, but not much that will interest those who like a new adventure every meal.\n\nAnswer:",

Cant exactly remember the three cuts of meat other than one being eye of round but i had about 4 plates of it so mission accomplished. \\n\\nI would highly recommend grabbing the Sukiyaki style.

Meat plates are done right and slices to order. Depending on where you sit you can watch your meat being sliced and assembled which is nice. No browning of meat that's been stacked on top of another and left in the fridge. \\n\\nFour instead of five stars mainly due to my mistake of ordering the shabu shabu instead of the Sukiyaki. Pretty much ended up grabbing Anthony M's left other broth and threw it into my own which turned out A LOT better then expected but one of hte staff came by and topped me off with shabu shabu water/broth and it got watered down.

They both advertised including goat cheese or chevre, but the amount on the salad was almost non-existent.  The beat salad boasted roasted beets, but they were served boiled.

They were both over-dressed, and just seemed to be missing something, or were simply off the mark.  The spinach and arugula were old, not fresh (had to pick out some brown and rotting pieces), and in general, the salad seemed sad and not at all lively.\\n\\nWe also ordered the beef shoulder with horseradish sauce, onion marmalade and potoato ($17.00).

This dish brought my rating from a one star up to two stars.\\n\\nI was very disappointed with the salads especially, and would not go back.

It had really good reviews so I was excited to try a new painting. We are no strangers to BYOB instructor driven painting, so perusing a new calendar was fun. \\n\\nWe decided on the abstract painting, because it didn't look difficult and can be modified with the colors. Our class size was small, I think there were 9 of us, and everyone was really positive. I don't like it when people think too much about where things go, just have more wine, and paint! \\n\\nOur instructor, was ok. I can tell that she paints a lot in her free time. She told us that the picture wasn't meant to be put on the calendar, but the owner liked it so much. Because she painted it at home, I don't think she was thinking about just how she would teach the class. She had a bit of a difficult time explaining how she got to where she did at which point. She also didn't finish her painting, which was strange. \\n\\nOur class was very independent and didn't need to be coddled, but I just think it could have been more instructional. She was nice, and I liked the studio, I just don't think the teaching style is for me.\n\nAnswer:",

It's run by Lothian and Borders Police, but the museum isn't from a too overly police perspective. It tells the story of Edinburgh's police force and some of the more colourful episodes of Edinburgh's criminal history. Despite my initial lack of enthusiasm even I managed to find the displays entertaining.\\n\\nThe museum is literally one room and shouldn't take long to look around. The space is used efficiently and there's a decent amount to take in considering.\\n\\nIt's free, it doesn't take long and it's right in the middle of town.

It's winter time...We decided to go here after I was looking at all the yummy looking photos on yep.  I saw this place a few years ago when it was coming soon.....Soooo, we walked in this place, and you couldn't even get to the host to put your name on the list for a table.   Ok so, we finally made it to him put our name on the list.  They told us about 40 min wait!  Wow!  Come to find out, you can't call and make reservations, not good!  We decided to just order to go.  Well that was still a 40 min. wait.  We ordered the fried chicken appetizer, My husband ordered the Ronin Burger uummmm, they kept the egg though!  I ordered the Crusty Crab, Truffle fries and salt and pepper fries.\\n\\nI loved the Chicken appetizer, it was so good, but with all the dipping sauces, I wasn't sure what was suppose to go with it.  I did try all of the sauces with the chicken.  Again, not sure which one was suppose to go with the chicken\\n\\nI loved both fries the truffle one was different, but it was still good.  I really liked the salt and pepper one.  It had jalapenos and cilantro on it,  what a nice touch. \\n\\nThe Ronin, we ordered well done....we didn't get that, it was medium well!  If that were my burger, I couldn't have eaten it!  When a customer ask for well done, we don't want to see any red!  So due to that I didn't even get to taste it.  My husband was ok with it.  He said it was not bad.  Except he would have also left the coleslaw off. \\n\\nSo on to the Crusty Crab...I'm not use to mushy...If you like your crab crispy....I would pass on this one.  It was mushy....I wasn't expecting this to be mushy.  It was eitable, but I think crispy is better.   I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Try something else, unless you don't mind mushy.\\n\\nThe employee's seemed like they were stressed out!  It was crazy busy, and this is a Wednesday night.    I would hate to see it on a Friday or Saturday.\\n\\nI think if I go back, I will call ahead, and only get it to go, the host said it's busy all the time!  Great for them, but I don't like to wait like that.\n\nAnswer:",

Well, mostly him; HE knows pulled pork.  It was so good he said it gave him heartburn!  (He doesn't usually eat to the point of getting heartburn!)\\n\\nI had the pork ribs, half rack ... very meaty and the sauce was AWESOME.  Wasn't as sweet as most places which I liked.  I ate my husband's potato salad because it was that good (I'm pretty picky about my potato salads).  My 13mo old daughter had a hot dog and she ate up the whole dog.  The fries were also pretty tasty!!  I didn't care much for the baked beans but I'm not really a baked beans kind of person.  I would say the baked beans were par with other places.\\n\\nI would definitely give this place another go ... and another.

I read the Yelp reviews... some great, and some poor and decided I'd make a visit to see the truck even though they had some pretty bad reviews on here.\\n\\nI don't live in Vegas, but am in town right now for Pubcon (a Search Marketing conference) for the next few days.  I contacted them and let them know I wanted to set up an appointment with them on Wed. morning to see the specific truck I was interested in.  We scheduled the appointment a few days prior to me being in town.  I then called them Wed. morning about an hour prior to my appointment to confirm the appointment and to make sure the truck I wanted was there.  I let them know I'd be by in about an hour and was looking forward to seeing the truck.  Appointment confirmed.\\n\\nI show up at 9:45 am, about 50 min. after I called and am greeted outside by a sales woman.  She brings me in, sits down and asks my name, pulls up my appointment and then takes me over to see the manager.  The manager pulls up my appointment and says to me - \\\"oh, you're hear to see truck X, (not listing what I want so I don't get spammed here by other dealers) it's really nice.\\\"  She then calls over a salesman to take me over to the trucks location and show it to me.  I head out the door with him and after a hundred yards or so as we're heading toward another building he tells me that the truck I am interested in was sold yesterday.\\n\\nAt this point, I'm annoyed! not because the truck is sold, but because NO ONE told me that when they had a chance to save me the trouble and time it took to go there, check in, talk to the manager, etc.  I'm in town on business and making a trip out of my way to see this truck and they knew it was sold... so why keep my appointment? Why invite me in?  Why send me to the manager and a salesman?  Simple answer, they figured why tell him it's sold; let's just get him in here and see if we can sell him something else instead.  PROBLEM is that is a total waste of my time.\\n\\nInitially I thought, maybe they didn't know it had sold when we spoke on the phone to confirm the appointment???  Now that I've thought about it more, I don't buy it though and that's why I'm giving them a bad review here and I don't buy the manager telling me: \\\"oh, you're hear to see truck X, it's really nice\\\" and here's why.  After I spoke to the manager and she called over the salesman she wanted to help me, we walked right outside and began talking while walking toward the lot and on the way he told me the truck had sold.  He didn't have any paperwork to check on it, he didn't call anyone on the way, we didn't go to an empty stall and then he called someone and said, where is X truck at?  He just knew that I was there to see the truck and it had sold the day before.\\n\\nAnyway, after he told me the truck had sold I told him my visit there was a waste of time and that I wished they would have told me earlier, etc.  He quickly checked his inventory to see if they had anything else on the lot that was similar to what I wanted and they didn't and that was that, I left.\n\nAnswer:",

Unfortunately, the day of my wedding was horrible.  My fault that I didn't go in for a practice run, BUT I was assured by their ANSWERING SERVICE that I would get \\\"one of their best,\\\" because that's who they send out.  The lady that came to our hotel room to do our (my mom and me) hair was rude and not talented.  She barely spoke and when she did it was defensive and not from a place of yes.  When a bridesmaid (who went to DryBar to get her hair done and wasn't satisfied) agreed with me that my hair style should be fixed, the stylist looked at her phone and said,\\\"well, what time is it?\\\" as she argued with us that she couldn't do anything else with my hair because it's fine.  We were like \\\"we don't care what time it is, it's my wedding, and I will pay you whatever it takes to get my hair looking the way I want it.\\\"  My mom hated her hair, took pictures to send to DryBar and then fixed it herself.  The problem with getting a quick solution is that they have an answering service which makes problem solving an issue, especially when you have limited time and makes scheduling a large group complicated.  Again, I've been happy once or twice, they have a few good stylists and a lot of very mediocre ones.  I think I'll try some of the other blowdry bars in town.\n\nAnswer:",

The burger was definitely on the greasy side as evidence by the accumulation of grease on the bottom of the takeout container. Interestingly, the beef patty was on the dry side. Despite this, I think I would return and try the Classic Burger, which is on a brioche bun (looks great).

This place is too stuffy and has no friendly staff whatssoever. Also they need a picture of your girls if you want to be on guestlist. Okay Mr. Fancy Superficial dumbass.... & once you do get approved or w.e; they tell you you're on guestlist but once you get there, they tell you that you have to pay a reduce fee. Paying is fine, but at least give us a heads up.. and not tell us when we arrive. Whatdabullshit?! This club is dumb and totally not as promising as the hype. I had a bad first experience.. came back a 2nd time to give it a 2nd chance, but still its a disappointment. Never will i come back to this Hakkashit nightclub.\\n----------------- EDIT ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n10/3. I slightly changed the ratings from 1 star to 3,  maybe 3.5, but 4 indicates that I'm a fan but I'm really not. This past weekend, I gave Hakkasan another go. To be honest, I had a lot more fun this time around versus the first two times I've been here. I love the hiphop floor more than the edm floor, so their hip hop floor is pretty nice. Our host for our table was extremely nice and funny, I think his name was Max but I might have forgot his name, but he was pretty cute. The hostess at our table was really helpful and sweet! So not all the staffs at Hakkasan are unfriendly!  This visit would've been a 5 ratings or even a 4 but around 2am, the bouncer kicked us out of our table because we didn't have any alcohol beverages anymore on the table, I didn't know or wasn't notified that you have to have drinks at the table at all times in order to stay there. Bummer.... Regardless of getting kicked out, things was going fine, until two of my friends lost their wallet because someone pickpocketed him. this had happen almost consistently; once this trip and another back in August.  My friend who lost her phone did not drop it because it was in her purse that was zipped up. I don't really blame Hakkasan for the thefts, since it could happen at any nightclub, but people should just be extra careful when they go to Hakkasan. Go hard for another nightclub! :)\n\nAnswer:",

I ended up getting chicken salad with fruit. It was a small scoop of mediocre chicken salad on top of a bed of undressed greens with some grapes and two strawberry slices sprinkled on. When I asked for some dressing they told me there was some on the table. They must have been talking about the oil covered squeeze bottle containing a tasteless vinegarette.

We dined there recently and at different times Brunch on Fathers Day in their what I call \\\"The Garden of Eden\\\" which included their famous burger with the most amazing fries, lunch included an appetizer the tropezienne salad a refreshing just right mix of greens with a vinaigrette that we need to have them share with us the recipe. Now dinner has a variety of amazing dishes starting with the duo salmon or the scallop which were served by an extremely professional staff and were to die for. Our main meals consisted of a pasta with clams with a mouthwatering creamy without the cream sauce. The cod was served with a touch of olive oil and was so fresh that it's a must try dish in Montreal.Our friends were so impressed with the decor and the setting sitting inside a glamorous but not overly done restaurant that has a garden as its setting. Was it expensive not more than any other first class restaurant in our beautiful city and yet the quality and service led by Cyril their manager was above and beyond what we were expecting. The to die for desserts were a masterpiece of perfection in taste and presentation especially the chocolat coulant. This restaurant has again established Montreal as the gourmet capital of Canada and for that we thank you Daniel. Bienvenue a Montreal !!!\n\nAnswer:",

Which other banh mi place can boast they make their own bread? THEIR OWN BREAD??? A good banh mi is only as good as the bread that it is incased it. Not many and don't give me lip about general lee's fakewich down the street either. If you want the real deal, you got to dig deep. Sandwiches range from 3.25 - 3.75.

Another amazing thing about them is that you buy 11, they give you the 12th free! SCORE. with 12 different kinds of banh mi and even a vegetarian to boot, who wouldn't want to give this place a shot?

On Monday our pediatrician was horrified that nothing was done. My son needed an aggressive antibiotic treatment that should have been started that day, even prophyllactically as his condition ended up being time sensitive.

Sadly, I was taken. When I got home I realized the down stem didn't fit right so I e-mailed the company of my water pipe hoping they could tell me the right size and help guide me to purchasing one that fit right so they had me send pictures of piece. Upon an e-mail I received back from one of the staff I was informed that the piece I had bought was a knock off and that they don't even sell their water pipes in the U.S. (Canadian Brand). So please don't get taken like me and spend lots of your hard earned money on cheap knock off brands thinking your buying the real thing. Had they had told me it was a knock off and then sold it to me would have been a different story. But if your like me, you know good glass is not cheap so I when I spent my money on the real thing I expect to get the real thing.\\n\\n**UPDATE** I called and talked to the store manager. Upon explaining my story to him he told me there was nothing he could do. He apologized and said that he remembers the piece and that he wasn't sure where they had gotten it (even though he's the manager). He wasn't able to do a refund or exchange or at least offer a resolution to my problem. Oh but he did mention that he can guarantee all the pieces in the shop today are genuine. LOL! Why bother and take the chance when the trust has already been broken. Next time I'll take my business to Traders or Blaze. Where I know for sure every piece in their shop is real and not a knock off.\\n\\n**UPDATE** The manager of the store called me back and left a message saying that they had found my piece on a few websites and had some info and to call back. I called back and the manager proceeded to tell me that he had went online and found my piece and that they did actually order the piece from GEAR. I had told GEAR about the smoke shop I gotten mine from but they didn't say anything about them being a previous retailer. I then told the manager how I also did my research and the ones I looked up look nothing compared to the ones on the internet. I then said but if you can show me some kind of  proof that you guys purchased this piece from gear then that would be great. He then got defensive and said hey look man I don't know what else we can do for you its just a matter of speculation at this point. I then replied okay well I'll talk to your manager tomorrow and proceeded to swear at me and say that his manager will tell me the same sh*t. I then ended the call. So if they really wanted to protect their name and rep they would have just made things right. Instead they decided to be greedy and money hungry and start using profanity to me a customer who had spent over $100 in their shop. Just take it from me GO TO TRADERS OR BLAZE OR TRAILS OR ANY REPUTABLE SMOKE SHOP BUT HERE.\n\nAnswer:",

For dinner, the food was okay, but the service was severely lacking. It took forever (about 2 hours total) to order our food, get water and refills, get our food and finally pay our check. The butter chicken was so-so. The aloo gobi even less remarkable. The 2 kinds of naan were too doughy. Despite this mediocre experience, I was willing to give their lunch buffet a try, especially since the wifey was curious to experience their cuisine. What a mistake that was... First of all, the price of $11.99 is at the high end for Indian lunch buffets, and this place is the exception to the rule that you get what you pay for. The selection and quality was downright pathetic and frankly embarassing. Ok, to be fair, it was still better than our abysmal experience at Sherpa House (in Golden, CO) but that is setting the bar extremely low. There were a whopping total of 8 hot trays consisting of items such as onion \\\"pakora\\\" (basically onion ring fragments), orange chicken, daal, chana masala, goan fish curry, lamb curry, paneer masala, and (non-Basmati) rice. There was also a small salad bar section and kheer. There was a surprising lack of classic staples such as mango chutney, samosas, Tandoori chicken, any kind of chicken curry, or saag. Although we enjoyed the fish curry, it could not make up for the lack of selection and quality of the rest of items. The garlic naan was so-so. It was simultaneously too doughy yet too hard and dry on the bottom. The kheer was the worst we've ever had. It lacked cardamom flavor and contained numerous clumps of rice. At least this time around, the service was half decent. The only other mitigating factor was they were running a $2 off promotion, although we had to specifically ask for the discount to be applied. That being said, the fact that this place garners stellar reviews is a real head scratcher. Perhaps, restaurants located in the (relative) boonies are held to a lower standard. Who knows? As for me, when I rate a restaurant, I don't care where a restaurant is located. The food is either good or it isn't. It's either a good value or it isn't. Unfortunately, this place is neither.\n\nAnswer:",

I ordered a lunch special, the sushi combo dish for $9.95.  Not a bad deal.  It came with miso soup (or udon), 4 pieces of a california roll, 4 pieces of a tuna roll, and 7 sample pieces of sushi.  I'm not a huge sushi person, but the fish was fresh and yummy.  The rolls were finely made as well.  I loved the ginger, which I normally am not a fan of.  The ginger was lighter in color, and not as powerful in taste as the typical red ginger that you find.  \\n\\nThis place is definitely better than most of the Korean ran sushi places (no offense to Koreans).  There were lots of Japanese people eating here, both older Japanese couples, and younger college students probably from the Charleston CSN campus.  I can't wait to come back and try the dinners!\n\nAnswer:",

Ever since, the order is always right, the pizza hot and delicious, and the delivery speedy!  The parmesan crust is amazing!  The coupons are great, and the on-line ordering system is quite easy compared to some others.  They are a cut-above the big-boys (pizza hut and papa johns) as far as flavor and quality.

The appetizer we had at lunch is the only reason they are getting two stars instead of one.  The artichoke dip was pretty good, nothing super, but pretty good.  Had the shrimp and crab crepes for brunch.  Scrambled eggs, shrimp, crab, and asparagus rolled up in crepe served with fresh fruit and fried red potatoes.  Sounds awesome.  It was far from it,  To start off the smell of the over ripe melon in the fresh fruit overwhelmed my plate with a horrible smell.  Strike one.  Next I moved to the potatoes, over cooked to the point that  they were black and burnt to a crisp.  Strike two.  Next the crepes, the eggs were over cooked and dry, there was not crab or shrimp in them, the asparagus was flavorless and overcooked, and the hollandaise sauce taste like something out of a box or package.  Strike three.  Sadly they had a fourth strike as well.  Everything on my plate was the same temperature, the crepes and the potatoes were cold, and the fruit was warm.

I'm not a big fan of the large chain sporting good stores (Sports Authority, Dick's) & thought this place might be a nice change from those. But I was wrong, this is basically the same type of place, just smaller with bigger prices.\\n\\nThey didn't seem to have a vast selection of anything, because they try to sell everything, if that makes sense. They have footwear, college apparel, tennis rackets, fitness apparel, baseball goods, so on & so on. But by their store being limited in size, trying to sell goods for every single sport leaves you with less room to have a big selection within each category. So the items are watered down & they can't specialize in having unique items for every sport, just your basic goods. But I will say the service here seems friendly & willing to help, even though I wasn't in the buying mood.\\n\\nOmega Sports seems like a locally owned sporting goods store trying to directly compete with the big chain sporting good stores. I hate to say it, but they just seem like a smaller, more run down version of these stores with nothing really intriguing to entice customers away from the big chains. If you're looking for a basic sporting good item they'll probably have what you're looking for, but don't expect a vast selection of things.\n\nAnswer:",

I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.\\n\\nI find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade.\n\nAnswer:",

The show consists of five \\\"superstars\\\", which change quite frequently, to keep things fresh and to keep audiences returning to see the show.  \\n\\nEach tribute performer is backed by a live band, backing singers and dancers.  There's VIP seating at the front - kind of theater-like seats in rows, but with a little cup holder so that you can keep your drink with you - this is Vegas after all!  There's booths with tables in the center and towards the back, and as you get further back, the level is raised, so I should think everyone gets a good view.  There are two large screens either side of the stage, used very cleverly to show footage of the real star, along with live footage of the stage show as it happens.\\n\\nThe show I saw, on a Sunday night, was pretty packed.  We had dinner in the casino's Asian restaurant - service was speedy, as we told them we were going to a show, and the food was very good.  The audience had a wide age group and everyone seemed to be having lots of fun.\\n\\nOur first performer was a Michael Jackson tribute.  The dancing was fabulous, from him and from the backing dancers, they did a great rendition of Thriller and he even moonwalked.  He didn't score as highly on sounding like him, as he did for dancing like him, but he did pretty well.\\n\\nThe second performer was a Justin Timberlake tribute.  I refer you here to the name of the show: Legends.  I do know one Timberlake song, but they didn't perform that one.  Again, more excellent dance routines, and the singer was charming and funny.  As we left I heard other people commenting on how he had got into a \\\"Legends\\\" show, a strange choice, in my opinion.\\n\\nOur third performance was a Blues Brothers tribute.  These guys were getting on in years, but still danced up a storm, like the real thing.  Great soul and blues songs, great jokes, a nice, playful set.\\n\\nThe next show was put on by a pretty convincing Tina Turner tribute.  She was a fit and lithe older lady with an amazing set of lungs, just like the real thing.  More great dance routines and some killer songs.  Since it was Sunday, she did her version of Tina's version of Proud Mary.\\n\\nOur final performance just had to be Elvis, didn't it?  He did the classics, interacted with the audience beautifully, made us sing along, and made us laugh.  This was the section with the best costumes, and the showiest lights, but then, that's how it should be for Elvis!\\n\\nThe show lasted around an hour and fifteen minutes.  There was a bar in the theater, so you can keep drinking if you wish.  To my mind, the greatest stars of this show were the backing dancers.  Even if I didn't know a song too well, and that's always a possibility when you see a mixed show like this, they entertained me.  The backing band, singers and dancers were one stage the whole show, and if they were tired from working so hard they didn't show it.  The costumes were incredible and we got at least one costume change per performer. It's a treat for your eyes as well as your ears, but the only drawback is that you don't know which five \\\"stars\\\" you will get for your show.\n\nAnswer:",

On Friday I used my birthday week (yes I said week, LOL) as a caloric excuse and finally made it out to try the best stuffed pizza in our fair city ! \\n\\nHaving read Yelp and with a certain degree of familiarity with Chicago style pizzas, I knew to call ahead to make sure I could squeeze Amore into my lunch break and still get in and out of there in under an hour. The lunch specials for $5 looked good, but I had to try the stuffed pie to see if this place lived up to my favorite spots in Chicago. Their large with 2 toppings for $15.99 was well priced (on special?), and was ready within the promised 45 minutes. \\n\\nI'll start with the service - it was fabulous. Our waitress couldn't have been more nice or helpful. The pie was beautiful and looked like the pies I remember in Chicago. Ok, I'll be blunt. This pie was by far the best I've had in Vegas (as far as Chicago stuffed styles go), but definitely isn't \\\"just like Chicago\\\". It's like Steve said - it's a nicotine patch equivalent for Chicago pizza addicts. \\n\\nFor me, the sauce was way too sweet but I realize that's personal preference. The crust while \\\"bland\\\" was very true to the style and for me extremely reminiscent of Giordano's . The cheese was extremely gooey and perfect and they didn't skimp on the quantity at all! The toppings were a bit skimpy for my taste (I'd like to see a bit more of them!), but otherwise it was a great pizza.  \\n\\nWhile this wouldn't be a 5 star joint in Chicago, we are in Vegas after all!

We live in Henderson, so it took a lot to convince my roommate to drive the 30 miles one way -- I had to offer to pay LOL so off we went. I ordered NY Street Dog, waffle fries & BBQ Western Burger w/bacon. I have to admit when the food got to the table, in the cute little bar style baskets -- I turned to my roommate and said \\\"disgusting\\\". It was so gross, to me (and I'm from the west coast) but it was all Chicago style -- like a mess. It wasn't the type of food you can just pick up and eat, the bun - from both the hot dog and the burger were just saturated, wet, soggy, mushy like dough like gross - which is where my \\\"disgusting\\\" game from. So the hotdog was some type of pressed meat type of hot-dog, like a cheap hot dog and it was not grilled. It was not a good, high quality hot dog at all. What I didn't like was it was all pink - inside and out I don't know I like my hotdogs grilled with like grill marks on the outside. This dog sat down in the soggy bun covered with sour croute and mustard. I bit off the one end and pushed the hotdog over to my roommate. He cut his burger in half and gave me half - same thing, and I wanted to take a picture but I felt silly - it was a big piece of mush. Seriously like \\u00be of it had been dipped in BBQ sauce........... It seems like the BBQ burger had some kind chili on it or something but it was all over saturated with BBQ/Chili sauce. I took a bite, the burger itself seemed like a good burger - and I did like the actual meat of the burger itself but as the BBQ sauce got all over my hands and fingers it was a mess, yucky - I set the rest of the burger in its basket and pushed it away. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Oh ya and they were out of waffle fries - so we opted for the \\\"natural\\\" fries, which ya, were very greasy. We ate all of the fries, because we were hungry and both of us not too happy with the meals - the little sauces that came with the fries was good  some kind of Cajun sauce and what seemed to be tarter.\\n\\nLike I said I wanted to like this place, I like the d\\u00e9cor and the waitress was very nice but this place is not my style.

We were not disappointed. \\n\\nThe food and service are excellent.  Todd bowed to my request to add a couple of his much touted scallops to my pan seared Lake Superior Whitefish.   The scallops deserve all the praise they get, but the star here was the Whitefish flown in fresh from Michigan.   The top was seared to form a crunchy crust that complimented the moist, perfectly done interior.  Thank you Todd.  Three of us ordered the Whitefish and no one left a crumb.  As a former Michigan resident I miss the LS Whitefish.  \\n\\nOne of our party ordered a full order of scallops and said they were the best she'd ever had.  Cindy ordered the  melt-in-your-mouth-like-butter Short Ribs.  A large portion, covered in an untensly flavored and delicious gravy. \\n\\nSalads all around except for me, were excellent and fresh.  I chose the Asian Dumplings (potstickers) with dipping sauce.  The dumpligs were small, very tender and sooo very deicious as was the dipping sauce.  Not a complaint from anyone at our table.   Oh and the awesome Watermelon/Jalapeno Martini was over the top.  \\nBananas Foster for dessert - excellent.   \\n\\nThe ambiance is very nice, somewhatt romantic if that's what you're looking for and reservations are strongly recommeded.  \\n\\nOur waitress was quiet, efficient and very polite.

They took our orders in order, then when serving the entire meal; each dish was yelled out by the servers deli style and then handed to our guests to place on the table themselves (if we wanted to serve ourselves we would have done a buffet). They did it very rude too. My plate was supposed to be served sizzling, but somehow the waiter forgot to serve it, as it sat on the table next to us for 5 minutes, then served lukewarm. On our way out (to dance) I witnessed the bartender reach into the ice bin with the actual glass she was serving the drink in (isn't this a violation?).

Although I have not had any entrees, but my girlfriend said everything she had was absolutely amazing. I myself have had the happy hour Mac n Cheese Trio; which was great a month ago but we did honestly get an iffy order the other day. The loaded french fries where also awesome (add the tri-tip, amazing). \\nThe beer selection is also a plus. Don't know if it's an on going thing, but all twenty taps were local Arizona breweries. We finally tried their own beers too. I thought the Pale Ale was their best, as the Cherry Porter was only slightly cherry-ish. The Goze was also one of the most unique beers I've ever tried; something like a soughdough bread beer. \\n\\nThe Bad: First off parking sucks, but then again, everywhere in downtown Phoenix has bad parking. Either the tiny lot is full or reserved for valet. Anyway, while the food is good, it is a bit on the pricey side and I feel breweries are more of a casual hangout spot so it's hard to throw down $15 to $18 for an entree on top of beers. Also, I love Happy Hour and I was surprised to find a bar & brewery that doesn't have beer on Happy Hour? Only sides & apps. \\n\\nOverall; great beer selection, great appetizers, no beer happy hour and slightly higher priced meals. We would definitely go back, but probably for a group event (as there is a lot of space) or special occasion like a birthday.\n\nAnswer:",

Not a big deal usually, but this trip to B dub was to get my buddy out of the house.  He had a broken pelvis and could barely walk.  He had to hobble past several empty tables while he was put on display for all of the partons and staff to see.  There was an empty table right next to the door.  Why couldn't we be seated there.  Piss poor customer service.\\n\\nIt gets worse.  After what seemed to be an eternity. our order showed up.  No plates, utencils, just a bowl full of wings.  When we asked for plates and utincels, the waitress scouled and shook her head in discust.  Wow, excellent example of how to treat your guests.\\n\\nBy this time, we had enough.  We asked to see the manager, who came over and blew off the fact they made a crippled man walk across the restaraunt (took 5 minutes) to be seated, and then he made excuses as to why his staff was angry.  Then he offered to reduce the bill, but when the bill came we were charged full price.  \\n\\nAs we left, none of the staff offered to help my buddy with the door.  As I pulled the car up for him, I noticed him fighting with the door and his walker, while the staff stood at the host desk and watched.  What a bunch of d-bags.\\n\\nI called in to the restaraunt after we left and asked to speak to the general manager.  He was out, but was assured he would return the call.  7 days later still no word.  Dear Mr. GM, here's your Yelp review.  Choke on it.

A good judge is that a  negihama roll had not chopped yellowtail but slices of fish and plenty of scallion for i think $5.\\n\\nThe only things keeping this place from a 5 star are that it can take awhile to get the food (even when you are the only people there) and some of the rolls aren't wrapped well so it's hard to pick them up with chopsticks. But These are really outweighed by the quality of the fish and the prices.\n\nAnswer:",

A couple nights ago, I had a wicked hunger smack me in the face around 1am, so I decided to give Gus's pizza a shot.\\n\\nGus's flyers all scream about online ordering, so I wandered to their site and thought I'd give that a try.  I noticed right away that next to their $1.50 delivery charge was a 49 cent \\\"service fee.\\\"  Being a poor college student, I decided to skip the fees and just call in for takeaway.  \\n\\nI call, speak to some almost-unintelligible knucklehead, and order my 18\\\" pepperoni, sausage, and garlic using one of the many coupons that have collected on my desk.  Knucklehead says twenty minutes and I thank him, chuckle at amusing youtube videos for ten minutes, and then make the five minute drive to guarantee that my pizza will be fresh from the oven.\\n\\nI hit up Delhi Palace a couple times a month so I know the location, but I had never been inside Gus's before.  I was immediately unimpressed.  Behind the counter was some mid-forties guido complete with slicked back hair and gold chain around his neck, and a couple of other guys who appeared to be trying as hard as they could to avoid working.\\n\\nI tell them I'm here, and guido turns to chump number one, whose job it apparently was to make my pizza. It turns out he hadn't done so yet, so he tossed it together, threw it in the oven, and told me it'll be ready as soon as it's ready.  I pay (using cash to avoid yet another fee), sit down, and listen to the banter between the knuckleheads behind the counter and the disturbing douchebag at the table behind me, who apparently likes women much shorter than him that he can dominate.  Mothers, watch your daughters.  No, not the ones at ASU, the ones in junior high.  \\n\\nMy pizza was finally done after about 15 minutes of angry birds, so I took it home and popped open the box.  The toppings all appeared to be right, but the smell was off.  Who knows, maybe they use the magical ingredient that makes their pizza as good as all of the one-review five-star sockpuppets who have reviewed Gus's say it is, but no.  Instead, I'm eating bland crust, oversweet sauce, and some form of dried chunks of garlic rather than the fresh garlic I was expecting between my meh pepperoni and tombstone-quality sausage.\\n\\nIt's important to try many things in life, but now that I've tried Gus's pizza I can safely say I'll never be back.

I will say that I have had 4 previous experinces with 2 stylists who were great. they were patient with my 3 year old and gave him a great cut. Then today happened. Like the other reviewer stated long wait time, stylist looked at us and walked into the back room. when she finally appeared I wished she had stayed in the back. My 3 yr old sat for the trimmers but started to cry when she got the scissors. I kept looking at his hair and something was off, I finally realized she went over an inch too high with the clippers and it was uneven in the back beyond repair. How do I know this, my parents owned and operated a salon for 20 yrs, I spent many days after school sweeping hair! When I called out her mistaked she claimed it could be blended. Finally another stylist came over and had to give her instructions on how to fix it. That tells me she is an inexperienced stylist. She continued to make it worse, now my son is in full meltdown and if she moved any slower she wouls be stopped. I finally told her to buzz his head. Then she refused to clean up his neck and trim his ears all the while saying it was his fault she did an uneven cut with the clippers. Really we blame 3 yr olds? She continued to argue then stomped into the back room. I packed up my kids, some 20 something mgr appeared and while she was asking what happened stylist 2 chimed in. At this point I an livid and yelling. Long story short they jacked my sons hair to the point it had to be shaved, NEVER once said SORRY and continue to blame it on him. I left without paying. The punch line, I called my husband and told him the story and he asked me what she looked like. I described her and it turns out that 3 weeks earlier she cut my husbands hair and jacked it so bad that when he walked through the door I burst out laughing. It was probably his fault for moving.LOL I will never be back an will tell everyone with an ear to avoid this place like the plague.\n\nAnswer:",

It was a horrible experience for me and because of their mistakes, I had to not only take more time to heal, I lost my job.  The guy who was to help me out of bed and get me to walk pulled my gown so hard and tight that he pulled my drainage tube 95% out the day aftery surgery...he was non apologetic, he just didn't care..and the nurse that came after our walk was in shock as to what he had done. She ran to get the head nurse because I bled all over my bed...the fear was that there may be an infection because of what he had done.  It caused me to ruin my furniture when I got home because I wouldnt stop bleeding/draining. My bed and coutch were ruined. While I was at the hospital, When I needed a nurse I would push the button...but rarely did they come when I called, I learned that if I crawled out of bed to the bathroom, there was an emergency button there that I could push and they would come running..   The nurses are overworked and hostile..the environment is non caring...I was treated as if I was an inconvenience. I was not treated as a person who just had MAJOR surgery, I was treated as if I was a 3 day stay at a cheap hotel.  The cleaning staff went through my things when they thought I was asleep, they even sat and watched TV.  The nurse who took me off my drip, forgot to put me in manually for my pain medicine every few hours, by that afternoon I was in sooooo much pain.  The head nurse and the AM nurse argued in my room over this.  My surgery was lumbar fusion, so I was cut on the front and back sides of me...it was painful to say the least.  I got my morning pain medicine at 8am, and got my next dose manually that evening.  it was horrible. Lets talk about food.  When laying in a bed, if there is a tray put on the rolling tray holder you cannot see it.  Some Blonde with a major attitude the 1st morning after my surgery walked into my room and and quipped \\\"Oh, not hungry or are we just on a fat loss regime today?\\\"  I was not at all happy with her comments, 1st of all, I didn't even know food was up there, no one told me food had arrived...because of my oxygen tube I couldn't smell. She had no right to make a rude comment which made me feel Fatter than I already am... later that afternoon more food came, she just dropped it on the rolling tray holder, then pushed it away against the wall while she straightened up...then left!  I pushed the nurses button for over an hour, finally when they arrived the nurse brought over the tray.  COLD mush is NOT an option...COLD coffee..no offer to get fresh food...I ended up not eaying till 2 days after my surgery...The STAFF does NOT care!  I wrote a detailed letter to the CEO, Head Nurse and the hospital administrator after I got home.  The CEO responded back to me a few weeks later apologizing and saying he will make sure there is more training for the nurses and staff. That's it??  Never offering to replace my furniture, or asking me what the hospital could do to make things better for me.  \\nNow a few months later, I am healing, but I have no job to look forward to returning to because my FMLA ended too soon for me.  I spent over 2000.00 for new furniture. Both of these things would not have been an issue had the staff been attentive and not reckless.  I have heard from many people that they also had bad experiences at Valley Hospital.  I wish I would have known this beforehand.  I would have chosen another hospital to care for me.  After all....it's about a healthy life.\\nps...there was an intern there who was very sweet, and even ran to the cafeteria to get me a cold diet coke...she mentioned that she may quit soon because she didn't want to become a hostile nurse like the ones who had been caring for me.  She was very afraid, and I wish her the best in her decision.\n\nAnswer:",

We request the same booth each time, and have yet to have a bad experience... until last night. \\n\\nWe had dinner at 300 East yesterday evening to celebrate my birthday. After being seated, we ordered drinks and my boyfriend let our waiter, Michael, know it was my birthday as he was looking at my ID. The point here is that he knew it was a special occassion.\\n\\nOur appetizer came and was great, however when our meal came my gorgonzola filet was so undercooked that it was actually unappetizing. We waited for Michael to return, however after about ten minutes finally had to walk up to the bar to flag down a waiter to send him over. He did not apologize for the steak coming out raw, but did take it back to the kitchen. Another ten minutes later he returned with my meal. The steak, which was the original one served to me, was now a mangled piece of unedible meat. Tough to cut or chew, and needless to say less than enjoyable. After a bite or two, I had lost my appetitie. \\n\\nWhen he came back to our table, he asked if I was still working on my meal or if I'd like a box. I said no, and before I could even get out that the meal was not up to par and quite frankly inedible, he had walked away with the dish, again with no apology.\\n\\nSadly, we were still charged the $23 for the meal which was the most frustrating part. It's one thing to be served a horrible meal, but another to feel as though the restaurant/waiter does nothing to make it right either by returning with a meal that is as ordered, or after a second attempt removing the item from the bill.. or really even just a simple apology and some sensitivity to the fact that we were here for a special occassion, of which he was fully aware. \\n\\nNeedless to say, the message was received from 300 East that they do not want our business, so we will no longer return to 300 East for our special occassions.\n\nAnswer:",

The waiters get better looking the closer you get to the weekend, the specials a little more glamorous, and the alcohol a little tastier. \\n\\nWe went two nights in a row, and the first night ordered so much food I actually had leftovers. The pizza I ordered was good but not great, but the bruschetta we ordered as an appie was outstanding. The bread was perfectly soaked with the juices of the tomato and the olive oil, and there was a lovely little palette cleansing salad to wash it down with. The only interesting part for me was discovering the mushrooms in the tomato mix... Seriously, fungi? Never have I had that in bruschetta before. Whatev. \\n\\nLast night, the waiter forgot to bring us our palenta fries, and when I asked him to take them off our bill and not bring them, he comped them, but brought them out as a bonus. See?

Even when it's happy hour, waiting times are never too long.\\n\\nThe beer itself is good, I like the blonde or the white best- their red has a bitter aftertaste and their stout is just too heavy for me.\\nTheir beer cocktails are interesting, you can have them mixed with sprite, grenadine, shot of whisky, lemon liqueur etc. \\n\\nFood actually kind of sucks. They rarely ever have specials or change their menu, I find it so bland. Their \\\"pizza\\\" like dishes are lackluster. They used to have some with chicken as a topping and it was removed from the menu, no clue why as it was the only good one. Crust is too thin, cripsy like a cracker or soft like wet pita depending on the day...\\n\\nTheir burgers are ok, the beer battered one in particular, but fries are frozen and just so flavorless. They serve everything with that mustard/mayo sauce to mask their lack of flavor.\\nThey serve beer battered thick cut fries as an appetizer dish, but you cannot ask for it as a side, instead of regular fries,  the waitress told me they are already individually portioned, so frozen, as a basket appetizer and it would be too much with a burger or anything else I was getting.\\n\\nThe wraps are a real mess, I've tried their avocado chicken wrap as well as a bbq chicken and it was always steaming hot with a soggy center, mushy pita. Looks like it came straight out of the microwave..\\n\\nFish and chips another awful mess, fish incredibly oily and soggy.\\n\\nTheir chicken brochette dish would be the best I had of the bunch but for 14$ the portion is incredibly small. I always like to replace my fries with a side of rice and unfortunately it looks like they only give you 3 spoonfuls. Once, their green beans were undercooked, hard, to the point of being raw.\\n\\nI don't come here for the food, neither should you, unless you just want a burger or nachos- A couple drinks or place to hang after work is what it's for.\n\nAnswer:",

I went with him and his wife, and we had a fairly good time, but maybe some of our expectations were a little higher.\\n\\nAs starters, the majority of us got the beef capriccio.  We each got different main dishes: pork shoulder, fried chicken, and shrimp pasta.  The pork shoulder was amazing with a mediterranean type of seasoning.  The fried chicken was okay because it had too much breading for its liking.  It also said it was boneless, but it did not turn out boneless.  The shrimp pasta was light, but it didn't quite have the wow factor.  The desserts were Tres Leche cake, pear ice cream, and a hazelnut mousse cake.  The desserts were yummy when you mixed all 3 of them together in one bite.  Each of them individually seemed to be lacking a component.\\n\\nOverall, the setting was great and lovely.  The food was decent, but maybe not at the level we were expecting when we reserved our night.\n\nAnswer:",

Since she was the only server the drink order took about 5 minuets after we arrived. My rating is based off of food quality. I ordered the Large New England Clam Chowder for 4.95, not badly priced, however I have had better canned chowder. very salty and WAY to much butter. Also the temperature for the soup was warm not hot, which probably means it was microwaved/ re-heated. We also ordered cheese sticks and calamari. They did look good when they cam out however, both dishes were under cooked and had to be sent back. Who wants soft calamari and cheese sticks? After the food was brought back to our table, the items still were not crsipy, whatever. the flavor of the breading on the calamari and cheese sticks was so bland and the marinara sauce was sub-par. Unfortunately i would not go back the Chowder house, rather go to Red Lobster!\n\nAnswer:",

After driving 5 hours from San Diego to Las Vegas, I make a stop to eat oxtail before I do anything else.  They only serve it around 11pm -9am.  You get a big bowl of several oxtail bones in broth, with carrots, celery, peanuts and chinese mushrooms.  It comes with 2 scoops of steamed rice and a little ground ginger and minced cilantro which you add to your soup once you get it.  Kinda like adding basil leaves and bean sprouts in your bowl of pho.  On weekend nights, the line is 20-30 mintues long depending on when you get there.  It's worth the wait.\n\nAnswer:",

See a Las Vegas Wranglers hockey game of course. The first annual Indoor Winter Classic to be precise. A game early enough in the afternoon that a young family can enjoy without the little ones getting crabby. A game where it snows indoors at regular intervals. A game that the home team wins with a final score of 3-2. Today was a great time. This is the third game I've been to and each time I have a lot of fun. Whether for todays Winter Classic, the charitable Guns and Hoses game (cops vs fire department in conjunction with the Wranglers), or just a general regular season game. I wish Las Vegas would get behind the Wranglers a little more than they do. They have been around for 10 seasons and have performed well. Maybe if we, as a community, get behind the Wranglers and prove we like this fast paced sport, we can finally get a major league sports team. If you haven't checked out the Wranglers, go.

About midway through our meal, we finally received our sides ( that we had to ask about) of zucchini and mac and cheese.  The dessert options included freshly baked cookies and milk or trio of sorbets.  The cookies were good, again nothing I couldn't have baked in my own oven at home.

If you have never been here it is inside the Mirage Hotel (the hotel itself is very nice).  \\n\\nThey give huge portions certainly one sandwich can feed two people and unless you are starving I suggest sharing.  \\n\\nWe ordered the borscht, \\\"creamy\\\" tomato soup and chicken liver with onions.  Others in the group order the Reuben covered in cheese (not sure what's it's called if it has a name)....if you're lactose intolerant stay away from that one!!\\n\\nThe borscht was pretty good, though they forgot to give me the sour cream.  The chicken liver & onions were very good, though we prefer beef liver.  They were nicely cooked on the outside and the onions sweet and caramelized...ummm delishhh!!\\n\\nOn the other hand the \\\"creamy\\\" tomato was more like boiled tomatoes thrown in a blender and a handful of sugar added.  DO NOT recommend this dish.  It did not have a creamy consistency, look or more important taste. \\n\\nThe cheese covered Reuben was ok, nothing spectacular just large portions, and they rave about the \\\"deli fries\\\" which were ordinary French fries nothing specially to write home about. \\n\\nNow the cheesecake with strawberries OMG!! ah-mazing!!\\n\\nThe service....ehh so so.  I realize that with large groups it's more complicated but a seasoned server should have it down packed and at this point forgetting items or giving us the wrong ones is just not acceptable.  And the only reason why I know our server was season was because a friend recognized her from many times before and she herself said she'd been a food server for decades.  \\n\\nNow as far as the server's assistant (the drink person) she was completely unacceptable.  When we asked about a menu item her solve all answer was \\\"I don't know ask your server!\\\"...humm I'm sorry but don't you work here too?? Or do you eat at the place down the street???  Not to mention that she did not make an effort to find an answer apparently anything other than drinks is above her pay grade!!\\n\\nAlso, the prices are a bit steep, for a sandwich I rather spend that money on a good hamburger somewhere else. \\n\\nOverall, it's kind of a hit or miss, really depends on what your order.

Pretty expensive, but also one of the best ever and well worth it.  \\n\\nMy only complaint with the place is the ordering/eating/paying system  - especially when it's busy.  That's the order - order first  at the counter (which can be a little chaotic), then go sit and eat at a table, then pay at the register.  \\n\\nSo the flow is a little awkward, but not enough to give it less than 5 stars for the best hummus, falafel, and kabobs, i've ever had on a consistent basis for the 4+ years we've been going there.\n\nAnswer:",

We met a few friends there, and are glad that we went early, because even with a relatively small group (5), we barely fit on a weeknight.  This place gets packed.  Consider yourself warned.\\n\\nAs we had heard good things about the spreads, we tried some, and they were tasty indeed.  The Htipiti (no idea if I spelled that right) was our favorite, and I probably could have eaten it all night.\\n\\nThe staff - or at least our waiter - was awesome.  He helped us with the menu, gave us tips on the wine list, even brought out samples (hefty samples at that) when people couldn't decide, big thumbs up on service, something that you don't always find.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, he even took me in the kitchen to show me the desserts because I couldn't decide which one I wanted.  Pretty cool.  Remember to tip your server.\\n\\nThe only thing that was somewhat disappointing was the main course.  That's not to say that everything is disappointing, or even that mine was, just that dessert was tasty (some sort of chocolate torte thing, but it was less cake-like than I would have expected) and the appetizer was awesome, the service was great, and the sandwich was pretty good.  The ends are great and the middle was, well middling.\\n\\nBy itself, it probably would have been quite good.  With everything else, so-so.\n\nAnswer:",

As soon as we got seated the waiter seemed as if she was in a rush, but the place was no where near busy. She took our orders, but never let us finish speaking because she kept interrupting us; again feeling \\\"rushed.\\\" She gave us our food and asked what else we needed, and she forgot our utensils, in which she basically threw them onto our table; once again, rushing! The prices were way too high for the quality. I ordered a steak and it was not juicy, it was bland when I asked for medium rare. My girlfriend ordered a southern style chicken fried steak and it did not taste like anything. The breading was horrible too. Paid almost $50 for just the two of us.

More than a 100 reviews, and an average 5 star rating on Yelp? It's certainly rare to find a restaurant with 5 stars after this number of reviews.  I had to try it to believe it.\\n\\nFood (9.5/10) = Simply incredible.  The first time I visited Gaucho, I went with the most frequently mentioned Yelp item - the carne (steak) sandwich.  This sandwich is HUGE!  Generous portions of a cut of your choice.  I go for the ribeye, which is a great choice for flavor.  Other components of the sandwich include roasted red bell peppers, onions, chimmi churri sauce.  The bread just absorbs all the juices from the meat and roasted peppers, not letting any flavor go to waste.\\n\\nIf a sandwich is not your thing, there's certainly a variety of other proteins for your choosing, both from the land and sea.  I was surprised and impressed with how absolutely delicious Gaucho's camarones (shrimp) were.  I'm always weary of ordering seafood if I'm not near the coast line, with the concern for freshness.  But goddamn, these shrimps were hella succulent.  Sooo succulent.\\n\\nOther worthy proteins include the chorizo, chicken, and flank steak.\\n\\nIf you're in the mood for some vegetables, Gaucho's grilled corn, and their mix of asparagus, portabello, onions, peppers, zuchinni, are also great choices.\\n\\nIf you still need more flavor, there are 4 sauces to help enhance the experience:   1) chimmi churri (fresh herbs, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, vinegars), 2) pimenton (charred pepper, garlic, fresh herbs, extra virgin olive oil), 3) ajo (roasted garlic, fresh herbs & extra virgin olive oil), 4) cebolla (carmelized onion, rosemary, thyme, vinegars & extra virgin olive oil)\\n\\nService (10/10) = Family owned business are always great.  The two brothers running this joint never fail in making you feel welcome, and are full of energy and enthusiasm for the food they prepare.\\n\\nAmbiance (8.0/10) = The place is small and cozy, and unfortunately there are only a handful of stools for people to sit on, as they enjoy the greatness of Gaucho.\\n\\nOverall Opinion = Incredible food.  Awesome service.  What more could you possibly want?  Well, my only annoyance with this place are their business hours and the very limited number of seats for people to chill out and enjoy their food.  I heard they are about to expand, so this will solve the latter issue.  Their business hours were a major influence on why it took me more than half a year after moving to Pittsburgh to finally visit this place.  It would be great if they opened until at least 8 or 9 pm.  It would also be great if they opened on Sundays.  Nevertheless, their business is thriving, and certainly not short on customers.  Like I said in the beginning of this review, Gaucho had an average of 5 stars after 100 reviews.  I now understand why.  It is TRUTH!  Now make your pilgrimage to this fine establishment in the Strip District.\n\nAnswer:",

There wasn't a stinker in the lot.  All perfectly cooked and seasoned (although I personally would prefer a tiny bit less salt, it did not necessarily taste over salted).  \\n\\nExcellent cocktail and wine selections, too.

Unfortunately, this restaurant failed to deliver.\\n\\nBefore I get to the food, I should point out a few things that really detracted from the dining experience. When I went into the restaurant, I noticed it was quite dark. After looking around the floor and seeing how dirty it was with the remains of food and even a spilled drink, I concluded that the lack of lighting is to hide how poorly the establishment is cleaned.

My wife came to this location about a month ago and ordered a bagel thin breakfast sandwich. It came without some special sauce and when she came back in and asked for more, they poured so much on the sandwich that she then had to have it made again ! The staff was also rude when she asked to have it remade. She then called Merilee the store manager who was very helpful and sorry for her experience. She offered her a credit for anything she would like the next time she came in. My wife,  my self and my daughter came in Sunday 5/20 and she asked to claim her credit. The shift manager - Chris was very snotty and said oh you can get the same sandwich they made wrong if you want. My wife stated very nicely that the store manager had offered a credit for a meal, whatever she wanted. She ordered a sandwich/side/drink and cookie. The shift manager was snotty through the whole order as if my wife was asking for something that was not due her.  Then today, 5/23, my wife and daughter again visited this location for bagel thin breakfast sandwiches. The Shift manager that had helped my wife this past Sunday (Chris)  recognized her immediately and turned to a co worker (it appeared she was snickering about my wife). It was awkward. Another shift manager- Chelsea was very nice but my daughters Pesto Chicken Breakfast sandwich was cold when she opened it outside and the cheese tasted weird. She was so uncomfortable that she didn't want to go back in to have it redone for fear of being treated in the same manner my wife had.  My wife's sandwich was fine.\\n\\nIt's really too bad that the customer service in this place has become so sub par as it is close to our house, however, after these experiences my wife and I will no longer patronize this Einsteins.

I thought going in that this place would be worthy of a a 5 star review, but the lack of service killed the experience completely.\\n\\nIt was a Thursday night around 7pm. We were seated in the back part of the restaurant and given menus. Joel and I decided we would share our dishes since we wanted to try the same things. We waited probably 15 minutes and no one had come by. No drink order, nothing. The waiter and waitress continued to walk right by us and not even look at us. Finally when the waiter walked by I asked him if we could order. He said \\\" our waitress was really busy that's why she hadn't come by, but that he would take our order.\\\" I ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice with an egg on top at a level 3. Joel ordered his favorite, Pad See Ew with pork at a level 2. The food took a lot longer then expected. I was hungry and wished we'd ordered an appetizer. I started noticing other tables that had come in after us getting their food. Weird. Finally out came our order! Mine was very tasty. It had chunks of short rib and the spice level was perfect. Next time I wouldn't spend the extra $1.50 for the egg on top. I was expecting it to be runny so I could mix it into the rice, but that egg was hard as a rock and did nothing for the dish. Joel's Pad See Ew was more broccoli then noodles, but still had a great flavor. \\n\\nThe decor is very minimum, but they do need to kick the heat lamps down a bit. We were sweating up a storm and not just from the spicy food. I had high hopes for Le Thai, but with that service I'll spend my money somewhere else downtown. Sorry Le Thai you lost me.\n\nAnswer:",

From the lounge, you can also reach the restaurant and the balcony, which really does have a stunning view of the Strip - the best in the city, if the hype is to be believed.  It's pretty spectacular, and so the balcony is always crowded with people wrestling between their desire to gawk and their desire to look cool and jaded.\\n\\nAnd yes, the decor is not only tasteful but actually beautiful - romantically dim lights, opulent Indian and Asian art and decorations, and exotic wood paneling and carvings.  Smaller, private rooms off the hallways are reserved for private parties, but a quick peek revealed low, plush couches and more elaborate furnishings and art.  \\n\\nThe main lounge is where the bar is, but good luck muscling your way up to the front and getting served - and if you do, you'll find yourself paying $12 for a small drink that's mostly ice.  Yum.  A second, smaller room has another bar and (at least the night I was there) a complimentary hookah table set up on one side, with three hookahs bubbling away in different flavors.  Bowls of plastic-wrapped disposable mouthpieces were set out, so you'd just grab one and get ready to puff - an uncharacteristically free bonus in an otherwise insanely overpriced place.\\n\\nThe music wasn't anything super-special - muted trance-house with a vaguely Asian flavor in the lounge, and more hip-hop in the smaller room.  But everyone is too busy looking hott and being way too cool to actually want to dance, so all there really is to do here is silently judge each other's outfits and suck on your expensive ice drink.  This is okay for about an hour, but then it gets old fast.\\n\\nI'm glad I went to the Foundation Room for two reasons: to see that magnificent view, and to have my illusions about exclusive members-only clubs demolished.  Yeah, it's posh and people are probably wearing outfits that cost more than my annual salary, but you'll have way more fun slurping $2 beaker shots and dancing to disco at Gay Corners, where everyone's allowed in.  Power to the people!\n\nAnswer:",

We knew the bartenders by name and they made good and cheap drinks for us, serving the food quickly. \\n\\nAt some point, it was like a light switch flipped (a former bartender later told us the owner lost it and started demanding change). Immediately the bartenders were sullen every day, making weak drinks and complaining, yes complaining to a customer, about any request that wasn't \\\"vodka sprite\\\" or \\\"beer\\\". They went from loving us (we must've spent hundreds of dollars there over the course of one school year) to verbally expressing their frustration with serving us. \\n\\nThe bar started catering more to the fratty crowds coming from smaller colleges in the area and capitalizing on their drunken tastebuds and open wallets. Some staff left, and the staff that stayed got either lazier or more frazzled.

You'd be better off going to the grocery store and buying their sushi. \\n\\nWe ordered a total of 4, count them, 4 rolls tonight. The first roll was delivered rather quickly. Nice surprise, however it wasn't one of the ones I had ordered so I waited patiently. The second roll, again, not one that I had ordered was delivered probably within the next 5-10 minutes later. Wow, we thought. Service seems a little better than last time. BIG MISTAKE FOR THINKING THAT!!!!!!!!

She came past me a second time and when I started to speak to her, she ignored me and walked over to a table that was cancelling an order because it was taking too long for them as well. When she walked past me the 3rd time and ignored me I happened to mention in a loud voice that I must be standing there for my health or something. Finally I walked over to the curtain that they have to divide the register, kitchen and hall to bathrooms from the dining area and told the lady we wanted to cancel our order, wanted the bill for what we got and that we would never come back again because service was so horrible.

The Half-and-Half (Arnold Palmer) was terrific and refillable.  The Meatloaf was incredible as well, there are so many layers of flavor.  It takes all the things you like about meatloaf and amplified them, while removing the things you don't like.  The Meatloaf sits on two extra thick slices of buttered Texas toast.  The final addition is a thick layer of cheese on top of the meatloaf, forming a cheese skirt on the side.  I said cheese skirt, people.  This is reminiscent of the legendary Squeeze Inn in Sacramento or Napa Valley.\\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese, though highly recommended by the waitress (who claimed to be a M&C aficionado), was alright.  The cheese sauce was grainy, but there's the pleasant surprise of scallions in the dish.

Nothing. As a third generation \\\"semi-native\\\" of Arizona and part Mexican myself, I can say without reservation that the food here is plentiful for all the big eaters out  there but as far as authentic or even flavorful, I would not waste my time. The Taco shells are similar to store bought Ortegas and the beans are no better than canned. All entrees are served in the traditional \\\"Americanized\\\" idea of a Mexican meal. That is to say that everything on the plate runs together and looks like somebody got sick on your plate.\\n\\nSorry. The only thing that was good here was the wait staff. Very attentive and gracious. One of the things I look for in a Mexican restaurant that gives me a pretty good idea that the food is decent is by how many actual Mexicans are eating there. Shallow perhaps but this place is to authentic Mexican food what Rawhide is to the \\\"true old west\\\".\n\nAnswer:",

Despite this I still continued to order, until one incident where they charged me for rice that was supposed to come with the meal. The top menu clearly stated that the chicken korma came with basmati rice, however when the driver came to my door (I had prepaid with my credit card over the phone) I noticed I was charged over $3 for the rice. I called and told them it was supposed to be included and I wanted them to refund my card. The man on the phone was extremely rude and told me I didn't read the menu correctly. 5 minutes later he finally pulled up top menu, and noticed that it did in fact say it came with rice. He said that the next time I ordered he's give me a free samosa. I said that I order there frequently, and the last time it took 2 hours for my food to arrive he promised a free samosa that never came. I was adamant at getting my $3 refunded and did not drop the issue. They did in fact refund the card after over 10 minutes of arguing with the rude man on the phone. They have burned this bridge.

It was probably the best part of the meal but no something I would ever order again.  I had the cobb salad for 15.25 and that was a huge let down.  Dressing was gross, chicken was gross, overall it was just sub par.  \\nWe decided to make up for the rest of the meal with some dessert.  Maybe not the best idea....\\nMy husband ordered an espresso (4.25) that came half full and cold.  We also ordered the chocolate chip cookie desert for 8.25 which was pretty good except that the icecream was caramel ribbon (or something caramel) which was way too sweet to go with the cookie.  Plain vanilla would have been much better, the dish was entirely too sweet and this is coming from two individuals with HUGE sweet tooths.  \\nLong story short, this restaurant is overpriced and the food is not good.  I would never go back and I would never recommend it to anyone.\n\nAnswer:",

I was right. The Khua Mee really hit the spot and satisfied my craving! \\n\\nThe noodles pack a lot of flavor, and there is enough lime juice mixed into the sauce to give it that extra lil somethin' somethin'. One bite and I was sold. It really took all my will-power not to devour the entire plate of noodles (which really is way too much food for one person).\\n\\nOn both counts of quantity and quality of food, the Khua Mee really shined! Unfortunately, my friend's basil fried rice was bland and slightly disappointing, but I think my dish more than made up for his.\\n\\nWe also ordered the shrimp toast appetizer because we had no idea what it was and wanted to try something new. It reminded me of the fried shrimp balls we used to get during dim sum, but much more oily. I don't know if I would recommend this for the health-concious diner. I'd probably suggest the spring rolls instead!\n\nAnswer:",

The reviews for this place and Tamba were nice, but wanted to find some place off the strip and with easy parking so picked Mint.\\n\\nThe place looks little shady from outside, the plaza was dark and the restaurant did not seem very brightly lit from outside. But don't worry it's a great place from inside. The decor is nice and upscale. It's a quite place, with comfortable seating. The lights could be brighter. There were few other table's occupied (All by Indians) - A good sight if you are looking for true Indian spicy food and not tamed down for the American population. \\n\\nThe waiter was nice, pleasant and took out his iPhone while talking to us. Realized within minutes he was noting down our order with an app from the app store. Also said they own a software company and are going to start using their own app in some time.\\n\\nComing to the main part! FOOD! It was really good. \\nWe ordered Mint Lassi and Masala Chhas. Both were very Indian and really tasty. \\nTheir Menu is very well organized. Great for Vegetarians and Vegans since each item says if its good for vegetarians or vegans. Very happy to see how they describe each item in the menu really well. One of the best organized Menu's among all restaurants (Comparing to all Indian, American etc. restaurants).\\n\\nFor the main course we ordered Paneer Makhani, Daal Makhani and Chole With Naans. Everything was really good. Daal Was very tasty, although the color might make you think its not the best, but trust me the taste is nothing short of what you find back home. Naan's were also very good. \\n\\nThey also have Nepalese  food but did not try it, but would love to try that too. \\nOverall great place if you are looking for true Indian Food.

Really?  And an automated car wash at that.  I've since changed my tune after having my car washed there many times.  The extra $$ isn't so much about the car wash itself, its the service provided after the car has been washed.  I've never seen a harder working group of people.  Depending on what you get, they will completely towel dry you vehicle, wash the inside of your windows, shine your tires, and wipe down your dashboard with Armor-all.  What I can tell you is this - I've paid $200 to get my car detailed before at Honda.  I've been happier with the $25 car wash at Autobell.  I should have saved myself $175.  That being said, they do have a $4 ride through option that I also used in between the more thorough washes I described.  The $4 ride through is more of what I was initially thinking when I thought the $25 options were over priced.  You don't get any frills.  You sit in your car while it goes through the automated wash cycle - thats it.  No towel dry or any other service.  This is a great option most of the time for me.  Great job Autobell!!!\n\nAnswer:",

There is a Hard Rock Caf\\u00e9 on Paradise, right around the corner, so that was kind of confusing for some people.\\n\\nWhen we pulled up at 1:30pm, there was a line out the front door and around the corner.  We pulled into the Showcase parking and realized that it was $3.00 per car, CASH ONLY!!! and no coins.  We had 3 cars behind us, and neither my husband and I had any cash on us (doh!) but the car behind us paid for us (THANK YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE!  I will definitely pay-forward this good-deed of the day!)\\n\\nWe parked and went inside, only to wait another 15 minutes to get into the venue.  The venue itself was good size and it was layed out nicely.  There were TVs with the football games on and LOTS of beer tasting.  You can taste unlimited amounts of beer.  You get a 4 oz. shot glass (bigger than a regular shot glass) that you get to keep and that is what you taste all the beers out of.\\n\\nThe food line was pretty long, but we thought the food was damn good.  Coconut shrimp, wings, wontons, fresh veggies, cheese, nachos and so much more.  Good job on the free food!\\n\\nEveryone was really cool, friendly and helpful.

The last two times I went there, it was not by my choice but by group consensus.  The food is also mediocre at best, having a friend whose mother is from El Salvador, this food was terrible, absolutely terrible in comparison.  The beans and cheese and pork inside my pupusa had the consistency of water, and the hot sauce seemed like it was 3 parts water, 1 part hot sauce.  Each time I went there I called ahead and placed my order, and I had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink and at a minimum of 30 - 45 min. to wait for my food (after ordering ahead!!).  I brought this up with the family that owns the restaurant, and they told me, in their exact words, it's not their problem, and if I had brought more people then we would have had better service and they don't need to worry about one customer because they have been there for so long if they lose one customer, they have many more waiting.  I don't understand how a place with one or two waitresses can even expect to adequately service their customers correctly.  I have been overcharged and never received items that I have ordered that were still on my check and I had to argue with the owner.  It is by far the worst service I have ever received in this city.

This was probably due to it being 69 cent taco night (Sunday).  It was a mistake.  The chips and salsa were both bland,  my diet coke was watered down,  and the 69 cent tacos were also very bland.  My girlfriend ordered a margarita with no salt,  which arrived with salt.  We told the waiter she asked for no salt and he argued with us,  saying she never said that.  She just settled for what was brought to her.  After we asked for the check the waiter walked by several times serving other tables until we had to ask for the check a second time.  The service sucked and so did the food.  The only good thing about the experience was the price.  I don't recommend it.\n\nAnswer:",

All 12 of us had made our reservations in the same week in Nov, all for the same dates, and not one of us had the same rate...then being a military group we had day and night shifts, the free meal coupon could not be used past noon, so half our guys missed out on this, and the management would not make an exception, they said it would mess up their paperwork and require extra work, so they opted to stick it to the Soldiers.   \\n\\nSo on to the rooms, they where all newer furnishings, but all where pretty filthy, things like hairs everywhere, and food particles on the floor.   It took over a week to get mine vacuumed properly!  The rooms all have large gaps around the doors and little bugs are common, they also have little window unit AC and heat that kind of works.  But, the best part is the shower, when you first turn it on the water is brown, no BS, and after that clears it won't stay hot, goes hot cold, hot cold...this place is a joke, and It gets better, so to see if I can get a hot something I fill the tub (after the brown clears) and come back to it after a few minutes, well now the water is full of pebbles and dirt.  I confirmed with the others in our group and this was standard for all rooms.\\n\\nOverall worst hotel I've ever stayed in, even if your just passing through I would highly advise going a bit further to Casa Grande, Goodyear, or Yuma depending on your direction.

Honestly, the menu was much more diverse and had more selection than I thought it would.

XS is by far the most beautiful and stunning club I've ever partied at.  This is comparing all the clubs I've been to in Vegas, from the Bay, and all the way down to L.A.  The amount of detail was highly thought out and nothing was left untouched, which help make XS simply amazing and unreal.  Steve Wynn has truly outdone himself with this club.\\n\\nThe club itself is huge and extremely luxurious.  Sexy curvy golden female figures are portrayed throughout the club in very good taste.  A huge rotating chandelier helps set the mood and highlight the dance floor.  Stripper poles are also staged all over the club, which helps intensify the sex appeal.  Similar to Wynn's Tryst, there is a huge poolside outdoor area, a perfect spot to cool down or catch some fresh air.  Though there is no waterfall, the outdoor area is much larger and elegant with plenty of seating & tables outside. One of the coolest things about the outside area is there are also gambling tables, mostly consisting of blackjack tables.\\n\\nMy only complaint regarding the club I experienced was the music.  First off, I didn't like the location of the DJ booth, which is located all the way in the back and is very hidden.  I spent a few minutes trying to figure out if there was a live DJ or if they were playing random cds.  Granted that we went on a Sunday night, but the music was horrible at best.  The transition between songs was way off and the selection of music was highly suspect and sucked. I know me and my friend couldn't have been the only people feeling this way with the music, because when I looked at other people dancing I noticed at times they would stop/pause as well.\\n\\nSummary: Looks alone club XS is visual eye candy 5+ stars, but the substance (music/DJ) is only 1 star at best. I think I have to try another night because a few people mentioned the music was good on Friday and Saturday night. I hate to rate this place this low because I really liked the place, it's just I wasn't feeling the music and that's a big part of the experience.\n\nAnswer:",

I was returning a very expensive pair of blue jeans and was greeted by the rudest sales associate of all time.  The return policy is clear that you need either the sales receipt or the original tags.  I had purchased the jeans a week ago in Houston and in the packing and unpacking process I had lost the tags.  The sales representative basically told me I was an idiot for not keeping the tags and tried to tell me she was going to give me $29 or a $128 pair of jeans that I had the sales receipt for.  I've never in my life had such an awful return experience.  I got my money back, but will never make the mistake of shopping at Dillards ever again.  I hope they become a casualty of the down economy.  They don't deserve to be in business!\n\nAnswer:",

This location offers two floors of shoes!  Men's are upstairs along with all the Clearance racks.  I think there is a pretty darn healthy selection of shoes to choose from and offered at very reasonable prices.  So, I haven't had the benefit of going to the other locations, but this one has enough selection for me!\\n\\nGuys, be careful if you take ladies (wife, friend, or even your daughter!)  here - you may be spending a lot of time or money or BOTH here!  Actually, better here than elsewhere because they pretty decent prices!\\n\\nYou know what's odd... I didn't see a shoe horn anywhere in the store...

The lighting is dark but pleasant, the music energetic but quiet, and the ambiance rather pleasant. \\n\\nThe food is also good. I had the Sunday special offering, which is salad, prime rib, and ice cream for $25. The salad was good and had a decent flavor palette without being overwhelming.  The prime rib was tender and had an amazing spice rub that took it to the next level, but the interior was something of a vast wasteland of okay meat. The desert didn't happen for me - they had no options for lactose intolerant patrons, which was rather disappointing (and perplexing, given the upper echelons this place places itself in). \\n\\nThe service was rather poor. The server was clearly overwhelmed at times - at one point, he responded to our lactose intolerance inquiry by telling us that the ice cream was gluten free. It actually became rather offensive when we were made to feel guilty about using one of their gift cards - I have no idea why a steakhouse would make paying customers feel so awkward about using a gift card they sold!\\n\\nLong story short, the food here is four stars, the service two. Three seems appropriate.\n\nAnswer:",

I started off seeing Sylvia Manasco for my gyno appointments and she is wonderful. When I got pregnant I was switched to my current OB Dr. Tyre. She is nothing short of amazing. I've had both of my children with her and plan to have my third with her. I have a blood disorder and had severe bleeding with my first child. She was so quick and efficient that she was able to stop my bleeding and stitch me up in the matter of minutes. At the beginning of my first pregnancy I was with a different OB and I waited for hours in the waiting room for appointments. I remember I once waited three hours and then was not able to see my previous OB doctor. Is very different Dr. Tyre. I have never waited for more than 20 minutes to see her. I usually only wait 5 to 10. This is an amazing office and I highly recommend it.\n\nAnswer:",

A friend who is a dessert chef recommended this restaurant and agree it was a good find. \\n\\nAs other yelpers indicate, it's basically in a small strip mall with a few major chain retail stores. Despite the odd location, it has a nice ambiance with outdoor and indoor seating at night. The inside of the restaurant is posh with a NY feel to it, quite dressed up, something that you'd find in a city not in the middle of a strip mall outside the strip. \\n\\nI was quite impressed with the food. While prices are high, the food was delicious, prepared well with good quality ingredients. I had the whole mediterranean fish which was seasoned well. Our table also shared the meat balls, and octopus as appetizers along with the cauliflower side. One thing that our table loved as the butter that came along with the bread basket which was addicting - a little salty and sweet at the same time. \\n\\nService was a little hit and miss for me. While we did go on a Saturday night, the service at the beginning of the meal was attentive. However, as the night went on, over a two hour dinner, the service trailed off and it took awhile to get our check, dessert, and boxes for left overs. \\n\\nOverall, good place for food and would recommend to locals. As for tourists, it's far off the strip and there are a lot of other good places to eat that are closer and more convenient.\n\nAnswer:",

Would they have a list judging the best movie about grass growing?  \\\"In the end, Crabgrass beat out Ragweed just because of the potential allergens.\\\"\\n\\nNo, because sometimes you can make an entire category of things that suck, and chain restaurants, as a general rule, serve shitty steak. Not that I'm judging.\\n\\nSo if you go to Outback, don't expect anything amazing, despite the fact that zagat said they were tasty.  But outback is worth visiting anyway, because have you ever had their shrimp appetizer served on their brown bread garlic slab-thing?  The bread is better than the shrimp.  It's amazing.\\n\\nBut truly legendary status is only accorded thusly: imagine an appetizer with so many calories that three could share and still crack a thousand calories each?  Enter the cheese fries with bacon and a glob of ranch and you will know what spoonfuls of lard feel like to your arteries.
