I think the \"right\" reasons differ for everyone, but I can tell you what I think the \"wrong\" reasons are:  money, prestige, and/or any reason not having to do with personal satisfaction and happiness.  \\n\\nI don't regret my legal education, but what I do is not glamorous, and it can be very difficult and stressful.  Just read an article about the incidence of substance abuse, mental illness, etc. in the lawyer population as opposed to the general population.  There are a lot of unhealthy, unhappy lawyers.\\n\\nIf you go for it, then make sure you have hobbies that you keep up with after practice.  Don't let practice swallow you whole.  Also, despite the prevailing view that firm practice is the ONLY practice, make sure you consider what are currently considered \"alternative\" forms of practice that may suit you.\\n\\nI'm finally in what many would consider an alternative form of practice, and I still have difficulties and stress, but I'm much, much happier and actually enjoy practice now.  Do what makes you feel like a real person (cause firm life can make you feel like a soulless drone).\\n\\nGood luck.\n\nAnswer:",

It is said that he invented the joke whilst trying to return to his deaf landlady's lodgings . Each time he knocked on the door , the landlady would ask who was there , he would say Herr Driedler , at one point after she thought he had said Hair Dryer he realized the potential humor in the situation and sat outside writing down other jokes until the end of the war .\\n'why did the chicken cross the road' is credited to an Irishman - Seamus O'Reilly who actually carried out scientific experiments to find out why his chicken crossed the road - after three hard years he concluded that it was indeed to get to the other side . However, at his lecture on the subject ( Birmingham 1897 ) his peers fell about laughing and so , after much deep thought , he re-invented his paper as a joke , which has become the classic we all know and love . His descendants live a life of luxury , living off the royalties of this single joke .\n\nAnswer:",

He treats me so nice on all the dates we've had. Now he has started talking of marraige. I feel that being of a different race will not go down too well with his people so I'm planning to break up with him this weekend. This saddens me so much but what else can I do. What's your opinion? Also he is muslim but insists he isn't a religious person. Sometimes I wish we had never met\nAnswer: He always treats you nice?  And now he's talking of marriage?  Just because the family doesn't like you (why should they, in this day and age.  And if they do, that doesn't have anything to do with him) doesn't mean you should break up!  If he asks you to marry him, and then the family expresses a dislike for you, deal with it then.  If he's willing to look past race, so should you be.  Don't worry about the family.  If they're reasonable, they will get past their prejudice, and if they aren't, you have him.  He will want you whether his family does or not. \\nIf there is another reason you want to break up with him, think about that.  Why do you really want to break up with him?  And if it is because you're afraid the family won't like you, tell him!  Ask if they won't, and ask how that will affect your and his relationship.  If he feels its a problem, then marriage obviously isn't an option.  But if it isn't, then you can work things out with the family.\\nLove will find a way!\\nGive him a chance.  \\nIf you disagree with his religion, get it out in the open.  If he insists he isnt religious, you need to think about how it will affect your relationship.  If you can't deal with that influence in your life, you need to seriously reconsider.\\n\"Sometimes I wish we had never met.\" Why?  What is it about him?  Is it his race, religion?  You say he is nice... but...\\nIt really does seem like you're ready to break up, but these seem to be rather physical reasons.  Not very deep.  If you worry about these kinds of things now, are you really ready for marriage anyway?\\nThese things you have to discuss with him.  Look deeper for the reasons you wish you'd never met.  I'll bet it's something more than your race or his family or religion.\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Can you help me? I?\nQuestion: I need to know everything about it please. thanks for helping\nAnswer: Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but potentially fatal disease caused by a bacterial toxin. Different bacterial toxins may cause toxic shock syndrome, depending on the situation. The causative agent is Staphylococcus aureus. A similar condition, called Toxic Shock Like Syndrome (TSLS), is the result of Streptococcus pyogenes infection.\\n\\nInfection can occur via the skin (e.g. cuts, surgery, burns), vagina (tampon), or pharynx.\\n\\nThe number of reported toxic shock syndrome cases has decreased significantly in recent years. Approximately half the cases of TSS reported today are associated with tampon use during menstruation, usually in young women, though TSS also occurs in children, men, and non-menstruating women. In the US in 1997 only five confirmed menstrual-related TSS cases were reported, compared with 814 cases in 1980, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). [1]\\n\\nAlthough scientists have recognized an association between TSS and tampon use, no firm causal link has been established. Research conducted by the CDC suggested that use of some high absorbency tampons increased the risk of TSS in menstruating women. A few specific tampon designs and high absorbency tampon materials were also found to have some association with increased risk of TSS. These products and materials are no longer used in tampons sold in the U.S. (The materials include polyester, carboxymethylcellulose and polyacrylate).[2] . Tampons made with rayon do not appear to have a higher risk of TSS than cotton tampons of similar absorbency.\\n\\nVaginal dryness and ulcerations may occur when women use tampons more absorbent than needed for the amount of their menstrual flow. Ulcerations have also been reported in women using tampons between menstrual periods to try to control excessive vaginal discharge or abnormal bleeding. Women may avoid problems by choosing a tampon with the minimum absorbency needed to control menstrual flow and using tampons only during active menstruation. Alternately, women may use a silicone menstrual cup to avoid the negative side-effects of tampons.\\n\\nIn the late 1970s, Procter and Gamble introduced superabsorbent Rely Tampons[3] , in response to women’s' demands for tampons which could contain an entire menstrual flow without leaking or replacement.[2]\\n\\nRely used carbomethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester for absorption. This tampon design could absorb nearly 20 times its own weight in fluid[4] . Further, the tampon would \"blossom\" into a cup shape in the vagina in order to hold menstrual fluids.\\n\\nThe super absorbent properties of Rely caused vaginal dryness by absorbing the natural humidity of the vagina. Often this lead to ulcerations in the vaginal wall when the tampon was removed, offering pathways for bacteria to infect the bloodstream[4] . Further, the tampons super absorbency meant that the viscosity of vaginal fluids was enhanced, providing a good environment for bacteria growth[5] . In addition, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) has features which effectively filter the toxins of Staphylococcus which cause TSS[4] . The recipe for disaster came about as a combination of Staphylococcus aureus naturally benignly occurring in about 5-15% of women[6] , the insertion of the tampon adding oxygen to the normally anaerobic vaginal environment allowing for increased bacterial growth, and the tampon's super absorbency meant that women didn't need to replace them as frequently and so left them in place longer.\\n\\n\"Between the spring of 1980 and January of 1981, forty women died and another 902 women were diagnosed with tampon-related Toxic Shock Syndrome\"[5] . In September 1980 Procter and Gamble recalled Rely[1] after the Centers for Disease Control released a report in summer 1980 explaining the bacterial mechanism which lead to TSS, and that Rely tampons was associated with TSS more than any other tampon.

It says exactly what a soldier must be feeling. I especially like the part that says \"My hearts pounding wildly as I fight to stay free. Sweat, grime, and sand are stuck to my skin. My clothes hang on loosely cause I've gotten so thin. I'm a father, a husband, a brother, or son.\" I think that sometimes people forget that our soldiers are somembody's father, brother, or son instead of just an American soldier. This is well-written. Have you thought of setting it to music or putting it in a book with other poems like this that you write? I believe that it would sell. I certainly would read a book like that.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you think the guy who stole it will come to my house since he has my address now? I am very scared that he will.\nAnswer: In most cases,where purses are taken , they want what is easy to take....cash. They then throw your purse in the ditch or dumpster to get it out of their possession. Since you had a cell phone it may have been used, need to have service cut off. As for you personal items you should contact each one and advise of theft. You should live a little wiser due to the fact you are worried about someone coming to your home, although it doesn't usually happen. Check with your homeowners insurance, theft is sometimes covered. Unless someone knows the suspect by his video picture,I doubt he will be caught.\n\nAnswer:",

Two different kinds of dissolving have occured.  What are the two different kinds?  I have to divide them into two classes.\nAnswer: Are you talking about dissociation and Ionization?  Dissociation is when an ionic substance breaks into positive and negative ions in water or some other substance and are carried throughout the solution due to dissolution.  (also known as dissolving)  The other is ionization when a covalent acid ionizes and forms a positively charged hydronium ion and and a negative ion and is also carried throughout a solution due to dissolution.

Stuff your body does not need.\\n\\nIs it possible to eat a diet of perfectly nutritious foods, that is, food that can be 100% used by your body, so you never have to poop again?\\n\\n...not planning to do it, just curious.\nAnswer: Maybe you don't think of it as important, but defecating is as important as breathing, or your heart beating.  Our bodies are amazing biological systems and elimination of wastes is very important.  Asimilation of nutrients from food is important to sustain life.  With the proper diet, beneficial bacteria thrive in our bowels.  This flora is important for our health.  This flora help and support with : digestive process by helping digest lactose (milk sugar) and protein, clean the intestinal tract, purify the colon, and promote regular bowel movements, create lactic acid, which balances intestinal pH, produce antibiotics and antifungals that prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi, provide a passive mechanism to prevent infection, contribute to the destruction of molds, viruses, and parasites, protect us from environmental toxins such as pesticides and pollutants, reduce toxic waste at the cellular level, and stimulate the repair mechanism of cell, manufacture vitamins B6, B12, K, folic acid, and assorted amino acids, help maintain healthy cholesterol and triglyceride levels, break down and rebuild hormones. \\nThe best diet would be the one that incorporate enough fiber for the intestinal floral to do its thing and increased transit time, so you actually poop more frecuently... which in fact would be more 'healthy' for you.\n\nAnswer:",

He will need the reminder especially being away from home during the holidays.  Throw in some items that represent his favorite sports team (hat, jersey, cards, etc).  Put together a stocking (with all of his favorite treats)...this gives him something special to do on Christmas day.  Include some DVD's for him and his buddies to watch as they are sure to get some down time for the holidays.  And include some PICTURES just to make him smile.  Try to get some from his family too and make a small album for him to enjoy.  Have fun with it!\\n\\nYou will need to package everything securly, make sure nothing is persishable or illegal (alcohol, cigs, porn) and take it to the Post Office.  You should try to have the package sent by the beginning of December so it will make it to him by Christmas.

I'm a designer, but I'm also a gamer ... so, that being the case, I need a PC. I need a good Video card, and plenty of memory. I'd also like a long battery life. What company and laptop is the best to go with? And what chip is best AMD or Pentium)?\nAnswer: What kind of designer are you? Photo, video, cad?\\n\\nIf you're doing photoshop or video editing, you don't need much of a graphics card, just memory. Well, maybe not. You'll still need the graphics card for the gaming though.\\n\\nIf you're a cad designer, you will need to get a good workstation graphics card (nVidia QuadroFX Go 1400 is the best for laptops). Unfortunately, it's not half as good as the desktop QuadroFX 4500 or most of the newer gaming graphics card. If you're really going for the high end, you could get a laptop with an ATI Radeon X800 or X1800 and softmod it, but it's pretty risky. The X1800 might not even be softmod-able. However, even without the softmod, it'll still be pretty fast for OpenGL, not to mention much cheaper than the QuadroFX Go 1400.\\n\\nFor designing, you'll want a LOT of memory. 2 GIGs is usually fine for anything besides extensive video editing.\\n\\nYou'll also want a dual-core CPU. AMD Turion X2 is fine, as with the newer centrinos. They aren't the fastest, but they'll keep your laptop cool enough to let the maximum power out of your graphics card and memory.\\n\\nMid-range solution: The best would be the Dell E1705. Configure it with the 2nd fastest dual-core CPU, 2GIG ram, the GeForce Go 7900 GS. You can check Dealnews.com periodically for Dell deals. They usually post a $750 coupon weekly. The complete system will cost you about $1500-1800. This laptop will run almost as fast as the high-end solutions below. It's by far the best bang for the buck.\\n\\nHigh-end solutions: An Alienware, Dell XPS M1710, or Sager laptop with an nVidia Go 7900 GTX (http://www.powernotebooks.com/category.php?catId=26#id1415). I would avoid the Alienware and Dell XPS setups because they will be at least $1000 more expensive than the Sager model. However, they're usually better built and have better cooling. If you really want to shell out 50% more money for a 20% gain in quality/speed, go for them. But there's no guarentee that you're going to get anything close to what you're paying for.\n\nAnswer:",

It is currently moving away from us at only 38 mm/year, due to energy transferred by tidal forces. The energy transfer is also causing Earth's day to become longer (currently it is increasing by 15 microseconds each year).\\n\\nTheoretically, the moon's orbit would increase until the Earth's day slows to match the Moon's orbital period.

That is, there is no limit on k.\\n\\nHowever, I'm assuming that the problem states that you need real roots.\\nLook at the discriminant.\\ndiscriminant = b^2 - 4ac\\na = k, b = -5 and c = 3\\nb^2 - 4ac\\n= (-5)^2 - 4(k)(3)\\n= 25 - 12k\\nIn order to have real roots, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero.\\n25 - 12k >= 0\\n25 > = 12k\\n25/12 >= k\\nor k <= 25/12 or k <= 2 &1/25\\nThe largest integer that is less than or equal to 25/12 is 2.\n\nAnswer:",

Location related to global and local air streams also makes a difference.\\n\\nThe Sonoran desert (Tucson) is hot because of low elevation, low latitude (for the US anyways) and no large bodies of water nearby.\n\nAnswer:",

Why are they not with the \\nOther Coalition forces in Iraq.\\nIs it time to Scrap These Two out dated ideals.\nAnswer: The UN has turned into the impotent tea-sipping debate society the League of Nations was. In the 1930's, the LoN, in typical European fashion, couldn't even muster the courage to write Moussolini a stern letter for invading Ethiopia.\\n\\nToday, the UN turns its backs on the 1 million deaths in Darfur, the 750,000 deaths in Rwanda, the Chinese conquest of Tibet and murder of the Fulan Gong, the thousands murdered by Saddam, the terrorism of the cowardly sheep-loving Muslims against Israel, etc. Their peacekeepers can rape the women and children of those they're supposed to protect, but little else.\\n\\nThe irony about the current coalition war against Iraq, is that it was Bush who did this to make the UN relavent, to demonstrate the force behind its words, behind the dozens of resolutions against Iraq.\\n\\nIn NATO, now we are supporting the European economies with our military budget. Let those 'superior' 'enlightened' folks take care of themselves, and let us pull our troops and money out of there. There is no longer a Warsaw pact to unite against.\n\nAnswer:",

You ar now left with two. The one in the fridge cant work well as enzyme activity is slowed by low temperature.

For reasons that are not widely agreed upon, a cloud-to-ground lightning flash originates in this mixed water and ice region. The charge then moves downward in 50-yard sections called step leaders. It keeps moving toward the ground in these steps and produces a channel along which charge is deposited. Eventually, it encounters something on the ground that is a good connection. The circuit is complete at that time, and the charge is lowered from cloud to ground. \\nThe return stroke is a flow of charge (current) which produces a luminosity much brighter than the part that came down. This entire event usually takes less than half a second. \\n\\nWhat causes thunder?\\nThunder is caused by lightning. The bright light of the lightning flash caused by the return stroke mentioned above represents a great deal of energy. This energy heats the air in the channel to above 50,000 degrees F in only a few millionths of a second! The air that is now heated to such a high temperature had no time to expand, so it is now at a very high pressure. The high pressure air then expands outward into the surrounding air compressing it and causing a disturbance that propagates in all directions away from the stroke. The disturbance is a shock wave for the first 10 yards, after which it becomes an ordinary sound wave, or thunder. \\n\\nThunder can seem like it goes on and on because each point along the channel produces a shock wave and sound wave.\n\nAnswer:",

For organisms that are rapidly reproducing there isn;t any real limit to the number of individuals required. One of each will work just fine. That's because the degree of genetic diversity will be increasing simply through re-assortment, and with an increasing population mutations will be arising more than fast enough to replace any losses.\\n\\nThe thing we need to know is how fast you think people are going to be able to expand, and that depends entirely on where these two survivors are located. In relatively benign environments such as the eastern US or Southern India people would be able to increase their populations exponentially immediately. In those circumstances two survivors would work. In more hostile environments such as Australia or Siberia people would find life a struggle for a long time and you'd probably need a good few hundred.\n\nAnswer:",

Those are caused by blood clots that are inside the veins (called deep vein thrombosis). What you did was open up a blood vessel (popped it) so the clot formed outside of the circulatory system. It'll be absorbed back into your body, but it won't float around and screw things up.\n\nAnswer:",

A native biome is there for a reason and usually represents the best balance between soil, climate and biotic factors.\\n- Reforestation in case the original plant cover is removed. This may include planting trees, bushes or herbs, whatever is more adequate; also not removing the natural vegetation of ditches and irrigation channels, which prevents the soil from being carried away by the water.\\n- Environmentally-friendly agricultural techniques (less heavy machinery, zero tillage, etc.)\\n- Avoid heavy trampling (by machinery, vehicles, cattle, etc), because it causes soil compaction, inhibiting the growth of plant roots and thus exposing the soil to erosive factors.\\n- Sustainable agriculture also implies healthy irrigation methods. Excessive or badly distributed irrigation may lead to salinization, desertization and increased vulnerability to wind and water erosion.\\n- Care for the soil fauna and flora. The geobios (living organisms in the soil) are absolutely essential for normal soil fuctions. Interruption of their processes and cycles leads to faster degradation.\\n- Hire engineers with common sense and provide thorough Environmental Impact Studies before building roads, bridges, channels, or anything else.  \\n- Above all, respecting the limits for production in any given soil and being aware of the timescale necessary for normal soil functioning.\n\nAnswer:",

The spouse still has to testify, but certain testimony will be priviledged. Here are the basics:  \\n1.  All confidential communications are privilege.  This mean no third party can be present (with the exception of children too young to understand).\\n2.  The parties must be married at the time the communication occurs.  \\n3.  There is a split about whether actions observed by a spouse fit under the privelege (i.e. a wife witnesses her husband receiving stolen goods).  This will be up to your individual jurisdiction. \\n4. The privilege does not apply to suits between spouses.\\n5.  Only the spouses can claim the privilege.\n\nAnswer:",

It is directly responsible for 12% of the increase in drug sales (2.6 billion)\\n\\nWhat makes me laugh about the whole thing is half the time they don't actually tell you what a particular drug is prescribed for..then they tell you to call and ask your doctor if it is right for you... can you imagine actually doing that? Hey doc, should i take #$%^&*?....imagine if you ARE a woman and it's for ED!  Boy, would I feel like an idiot....\\n\\nThe second thing about it is they always list all the complications and side effects that could arise from taking the medication..talk about a turn-off....most of the time I'm sitting there thinking I might just prefer to stay sick  if this stuff could potentially blind me for life, give me a heart attack, or leave me sitting on the toilet for most of the day..(at least..it's a good thing for truth in advertising though)..\\n\\nI think in general the drugs that are advertised are sending pretty good messages...it probably helps people with depression, ED and cholesterol problems to realize that they aren't alone and that there are ways to fix their problems...I'll tell you what though..if that Bob guy loses his swimming trunks just once more on TV in the middle of the day..I'm going to have to call some kind of ethics committee..tee hee\\n\\nHope this helped\n\nAnswer:",

Seniors only please!\nAnswer: I'm not a senior, but I helped my mother find a place. We went looking because we wanted a place where they would check on my mother every day to make sure she is okay. One thing she wanted is a nice entrance with the feel of a nice hotel. She rejected any place that was small and crowded when you walked in. She liked the places with a concierge desk and marble floors when you came in. She wanted a decent size 2 bedroom 2 bath apt so she could have family sleep over. The food was very important. We rejected a place that only had hot breakfast three days a week and tested the food every place we went. She wanted a selection of food at every meal. She wanted lots of staff to help her by parking her car and bringing in her groceries. I wanted a place with a van service for when she had to stop driving and a pool and exercise facilities, although she has not used them. We also looked at the activities. She liked bingo and movies-they have something every night. A lot of her friends liked the bridge and poker games. She liked that they have a nursing facility on the grounds so she can stay there. She liked the attractive dining room like a nice restaurant with a view of the intercoastal. I suggest that you look at where she ended up which is Harbour's Edge in Delray. It has no trouble filling up although it is very high end. I am almost 58 years old and I would like a place like Harbour's Edge in 20 years. By the way, her friends have come to dinner there and have been so impressed that some of them have also purchased units there.\n\nAnswer:",

Then increase your offerings in those areas and get rid of things that don't sell.  If people don't have a lot of money they will still need to buy essential items like food, toilet paper, paper towels, deodorants, toothpaste....

The minimal electronics are finely restrained to the point where the sparseness creates a lusher sound than the components, a flow expertly embellished by the vocal harmonies that describe unrequited wishes. Sedate drums and gentle guitar flesh out the compositions, delivering the ethereal sound into more accessible territory.\\n\\nComparable to the Pixies and Beck, Escape Pod's music provides a serene access to tuneage of less demanding quality, providing sonic refuge among airwaves overcrowded with harsh noise.\n\nAnswer:",

Had those same leg cramps.  Mom the R.N. told me they were \"growing pains\" and to eat bananas and drink plenty of water during the day.  It worked.  Also, to relieve a cramp, try tensing those muscles up as if you were trying to MAKE a cramp.  Seems counter-intuitive, but give it a try, it works for many.\\n\\nLight stretching before bed might relieve stiffness that exacerbates cramping.  And if worse comes to worst, a benedryl will help you sleep through just about anything your legs can dish out.\\n\\nBest wishes.\n\nAnswer:",

Apparently, government policy has limited green card or permanent status for foreign citizens who wish to work full-time in the United States. Hopefully, the issue of Mexican illegals will provide some relaxation in these restrictions. If you are here on a student visa, you'll have to apply first for permanent status and meet those requirements, which include an offer for a job that is one needed in the U.S. But I think your chances will be better now than before, as the issue of immigration in general has been raised in the arena of politics, not just as bureaucratic governing.\n\nAnswer:",

We have no choice but to work on defense rather than offense. We might as well start reducing troops over the course of several months. And if anyone disagrees, why not?\nAnswer: There would be no lasting damage from the troops being progressively pulled out over a period of time. Although there are certain people who will bemoan that doing so would be a win for the terrorists, it would not be. It is unlikely that terrorists (international ones at least) make up any more than 5-10% of the insurgency in Iraq. The great majority of insurgent fighters in Iraq are from within the country. If the US and its allies were to progressively pull out of Iraq will still training the Iraqi forces and bringing in neighbouring countries to aid with stability there is no reason to believe that the insurgency would not die down and sought itself out. Fighting between Shiite's and Sunni's will not stop because the troops leave, in fact, it may even get worse, but the they have been fighting for hundreds of years all around the world. Leaving the country would however take away a big reason for their fighting in the first place and maybe open up a common ground avenue for them to begin talks to re-establish some sought of working government within their own country.\n\nAnswer:",

Brazilians do it too !!! It was the refs fault why blame italy ?\\n\\n2 Aussies played very very well, but they have to accept the fact that their finishing was pooor , & they created very little despite having a man advantage. They never looked like scoring & winning the match. On the contrary Italy had better openings.\\n\\n3 Ref was poor , but again Materazzi's red card was harsh, 11 against 11 would have been a different game.\\n\\n\\n4 Italy did defend very well, give them credit for that. \\n\\n\\n5  I agree there has been a mess in Serie A but you can never undermine the quality, Italian clubs have won European competitions more than any other country , check the records.\\nItaly hve won 3 WCs, they are the first & only european country to win back to back WC. Also they have the 3rd best record in WC next to brazil & germany, better than Argentina or England, you have to accept that they are good.\\n\\nSome people say they have little sucess in recent times well check this\\n1978-  4th\\n1982- champs\\n1986 - quarter finals\\n1990 - 3rd\\n1994 - 2nd\\n1998 - quarter finals\\n2002 - 2nd round\\nthey have not last a WC knockout match in normal time since 1986, and have reached semifinals in 4 of last 7 WCs, they have played 16 Wcs which is 2nd to Brazil.\n\nAnswer:",

Are they the same, but in different time periods.?\nQuestion: In my belief the Scare of Commies taking over the world like in a donomio effect, if one country falls they all will, that still stands true today but the commie Scarce was ended as the berlin war was torn down and the break up of the U.S.S.R which is now Russia, and the fact that nuclear war was never going to happen unless provoke by either the U.S. or the Soviet Union. My point is this that terrorism is a major scarce in american today, yes there is terrorist in the untied states like back then there were commies living in the states, So do you believe Terrorism is the modern today for \"commies\" , where they choose to die before independence or the belief in Christianity?\nAnswer: Yes and no.  There has been a 'west vs. islam' battle going on for well over a thousand years predating even the crusades.  The current 'war on terror' is really a return to this ancient battle of cultures.  The only time that this was not in the forefront was the 80 some-odd years of fighting against communism.\\n\\nI pretty much agree with you and have been saying this to people since I watched the towers come down from my office in Manhattan.\n\nAnswer:",

I am graduating this year and he will early next year from college. We plan on working fulltime and saving up money so we can both move out and move in together within the next 2 years, then save up money to get married about a yr or so after that.

What's up with that?\nAnswer: You don't have to pay to get information on available grants. In fact the information is FREE\\n\\nYou can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.\\n\\nEven if you buy books on \"how to get grants\" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\\n\\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \\n\\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \\n\\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\\nhttp://www.grants.gov\\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html\n\nAnswer:",

A titanium \"screw\" is placed in your bone by an oral surgeon.  The surgeon covers the screw with your gum tissue to let it heal.  This screw heals for 3-6 months, depending which tooth is being replaced.  The bone integrates around the screw.  After it is healed, the screw is uncovered.  A dentist then bonds a \"tooth\" on the screw.  Once it is complete, the implant functions and looks like a normal tooth.  You can eat and floss like normal.  Most patients say the implant does not hurt being placed.\n\nAnswer:",

Do not let your parents manipulate you by telling you that by being yourself and being happy, you are making them ill. Be considerate, of course, but they have to deal with their own feelings and mature in life still at their age.\\n\\n2. Introspect, and make sure that you are not doing this just to be a little rebel. Perhaps your parents have such a tight leash on you that you feel that you have to do something drastic in order to assert your independence as an adult. If this is a large part of your case, you would marry for the wrong reason, and very well have problems down the road.\\n\\n3. Are you sure that the fact that you are told not to marry her does not make you more interested in her than you would otherwise be? Introspect.\\n\\n4. If you not marry her, how do you honestly think that you would feel about that decision many years from now? Do you think that you would deeply regret it, or do you think that you would have warm feelings for her but be nonetheless more or less happy with another sweet girl? Be honest with yourself; you are best able to make a good and honest decision.\n\nAnswer:",

And never get involved with his partner because that makes everything ugly. Yes he does hate you and so does she. Forget about it, they're not the only two people in the world.

First the women Serena Williams, Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Maria Sharapova, and Amelie Mauresmo. They play singles against John McEnroe who is fresh off his ATP doubles championship.  He plays one woman per week.  The women get to use all the court including the doubles alley.  The women get three serves every point and McEnroe gets only one.  Does McEnroe lose every match, beat some players and lose to others, wins every match.  Your opinion on what I see as a fairly even contest.\nAnswer: If the only handicap you gave McEnroe was one serve, I'd say Johnny Mac would kill them all. The fact is Johnny Mac never really needed more than one serve. With his wonderful slice spin, excellent direction, and relatively fast speed, John seldom double-faulted and baffled many good players.\\n\\nHowever, when you throw in the additional handicap of giving the women the doubles alleys to hit into, every single female tennis player you cited would kick John's butt.\\n\\nIndeed, each one of them can hit with enough angle and speed to not only hit a fair amount of winners, but also wear Poor Old John out.\n\nAnswer:",

It was totally encrusted, but under xray you could see there was some kind of device inside with very intricuit clock-like counting mechanisms.  They proposed that it might have been some sort of counting or computing device.  I believe it was dated to B.C. ...I just found this.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAncient artifacts discovered imbedded in solid rock, as well as artifacts found on the ocean floor, give evidence to the fact that our ancient ancestors were FAR more intelligent in the scientific realm than we give them credit for. Yves Naud describes in his book, one such artifact: \"In 1900, sponge divers near Antikythera (Greece), found rusty fragments of a metallic apparatus on the sea floor. Scientists at first thought that they were remnants of an astrolabe dating from 65 B.C. In 1959, the English scientist, Solla Price, made a discovery which astounded the professional world when he published it in the NATURAL HISTORY review of March 1962: \\n\\n\"'It appears that this object is really a computer which can determine and describe the movements of the sun, of the moon, and probably of the planets.' \\n\\n\"This modern expert felt extremely humble and could only pay homage to the high science of our ancestors, although the homage was tinged with fear. \\n\\n\"'It is quite frightening,' he wrote in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN (June, 1959), 'to learn that, shortly before their great civilization crumbled, THE ANCIENT GREEKS had come as close as this to our time, not only in terms of their thinking, but also in their scientific technology.'\"\n\nAnswer:",

I think there are 8 Cd's. I highly recommend it. It is by far better to learn a language through your ears than through your eyes! Listen to the CD's over and over again and the nuances of pronunciation and cadence (the rhythm of the language which is important in Japanese) - look up \"Mora\" or \"Japanese Mora timing\". I recommend listening to all of the Cd's at least 3 times each while driving or something before even beginning to study them. You will be amazed how much easier it is that way. First time through play and don't even try to listen. Second time listen only with light attention. Third time pay close attention. Fourth time through start repeating whatever you want to and try to be precise in all ways -tone, pitch, cadence, pronunciation, enunciation etc.  Good luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Like in a ring, all those group of tiny diamonds \"stuck\" together right next to each other on the band is a pave' style. Usually an engagement ring has this big diamond in the middle. Then it has these tiny diamonds on the ring-band (either covering part of the band or all-over it) as accent...that is pave. Best example would be the eternity ring.\n\nAnswer:",

I always believed that Judas was chosen by Jesus to be the one who turned him in. Jesus knew he had to die and chose his friend to make it happen. He didn't betray Jesus. He was following orders.

It turns bright red when it contacts oxygen, either by leaving the body through a cut or by recieving oxygen from the lungs.  If you cut a vein (which transports deoxygenated blood to the heart and lungs for refueling) the blood will come out almost black for an instant before it hits the air.\\n\\nIf you look at your veins in places where they're easily visible, like your wrist, you will see that they appear blue, not red.\n\nAnswer:",

Im not attacking believers, but the people who find it necessary to tell the world why they are right and others are wrong- no matter what relaigion it is.\\nReligion (not spiritualism)was invented as a political tool to control the masses, and now has become the biggest killer in history. Is it not time everybody got off their high horse and took personal responsibilty, instead of 'following' or doing a 'gods work'?\nAnswer: You are a little hard on the religious.  While I agree with you mostly there are mitigating reasons for belief:\\n\\n1.  Humans are a tribal species with an instinctive need to follow.\\n2.  Ignorant people, which describes humanity up until the last 100 years or so, will believe religious doctrine no matter how ridiculous.\\n3.  Humans invent and believe in gods in a desperate attempt to have some control over Mother Nature.  \\n\\nThe reason churches hate secularism so much is it provides answers that work without religion.

Any advice from other small buisness owners?\nQuestion: I have never owned a business before,much less a restaurant. My mom used to do catering though and I would help. She is really sick now, and not able to cook anymore. I would like to open a small restaurant and use her recipes. I am looking for feedback from other small business owners, particularly restaurant owners. Thanks!\nAnswer: I am a professional chef.  I have been in the restaurant business for 15 years.  Over half of the restaurants I have worked in have closed.  Here is my word of advice:  If you do not fully understand the restaurant business (inventory turnover, shelf life, appropriate staffing, reservations, production, production capabilities, etc.) 1.  Find someone who is willing to be an investor that is capable of performing these tasks.  Make sure your chef has an interest in the success of the restaurant or,  2.  Find a safer business to get into.  \\n\\nIf you have specific questions feel free to email me.\\nmikechampagne@hotmail.com\n\nAnswer:",

No motion is involved. But both man and the wall experience force.Is it true?\nQuestion: Acceleration is defined as instantaneous rate of change of velocity.Since no motion is involved how could we define the above.\nAnswer: There is more to the system than just the man and the wall.  Let's say the wall and man are hovering in space and they push against each other.  They would separate resulting in motion of both man and wall.  \\n\\nBut on earth, when a man pushes against the wall and visa versa, they are both anchored to the ground.  As the man pushes the wall, the wall would move but the earth is pushing on the wall the opposite direction.  Likewise, as the wall pushes the man, the earth pushes him in the opposite direction through his feet.  This can be illustrated by supposing the man were on ice and had no traction.  He would surely glide away from the wall.  \\n\\nSo how can there be force with no acceleration?  Let's take the man's perspective.  He is pushing on the wall resulting in a force the opposite direction, but he is also experiencing the earth pushing him towards the wall.  Since both forces are equal and in opposite directions, the man's net force is zero.  The same goes for the wall.  \\n\\nSo, while your question is technically correct, you didn't take in account that there is more than one force involved, and those two cancel each other out.\n\nAnswer:",

Alternative drug should be considered if desired effect hasnt been obtained from  Luvox (Fluvoxamine) after 12 weeks of starting therapy, and it is 4-6 weeks in case of Lithium. Effectiveness of drugs also depend on the dose. It is unlikely for a drug to show any effect if the dose is suboptimal.

He will examine your teeth then tell you what he would need to do, how much it will cost, etc.\n\nAnswer:",

Other colors such as tan or orange were available but more expensive to produce.\\nThese were the days before large chemical firms, when small companies produced only a few colors of paint. If you wanted light blue walls in your study, you mixed white and blue --- you didn't buy light blue.\\nRed showed the best on water and was readily available. When undisturbed, the bobber's top is red. If you get a nibble, the fish typically turns the bobber over and you can see the white bottom.\\nAnyone who has ever tried to see a bobber against an evening sun knows how difficult it can be to see white in the sparkling water. The red helps, a bit.\\nIt's more tradition than anything that keeps bobbers red and white today. Lime green or orange would be better, and I have seen these colors on bobbers.\\nBut there's something comforting about a red and white bobber. It's an historical link to the past.\n\nAnswer:",

Why? Did you get a divorce?\nAnswer: About 2 in a half years into my marriage, I thought it was over! My husband had no respect for me, was constantly jealous and controlling. I became mean, and stopped caring about us. We both started saying hateful harsh words, and almost gave up. We split up for a short time, and realized what a mistake it was. I truly think, sometimes is takes something big to wake a marriage up! It didn't take long for the both of us to realize what we were doing. Learn to respect each other, listen to each other, and fight fair. If you need to make the first move on talking about saving the marriage, please do it. It's not worth it to be stubborn, and hold grudges. Life is too short. If you feel that knot in your stomach, and deep pain in your heart when things aren't right between you and your spouse, then it's true love. It's probably your soul mate. Love is worth fighting for, it gets better as time goes on. Sometimes you have to go through some rough times to get there. Good luck hun....:)\n\nAnswer:",

Not only am I eating less, but I feel great all day long.  This product is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  A one pill a day keeps your appetite down, boosts metabolism, increases stamina, and increases energy.  This is truly an amazing product I would like to share with the nation, world.

It has hoodia for appetite suppression as well as 77 other minerals and herbs.\\n\\ni've been taking it for a few weeks now and feel fantastic. I usually took me a big coffee to get me going, but i've trimmed back on that and make it the whole day on a single Herbalean.\\n\\nAnyway, check the links below for info on Herbalean and the recently lifted FDA ban on ephedra.\n\nAnswer:",

Reduce your current bills:\\n1) Eliminate immediately anything that is not needed.  (i.e. Cable TV, cell phone, a subscription, etc.)\\n\\n2) Phone bill - switch to a internet based phone.  I used to pay about $100 per month.  I switched to vonage and now only pay $27 flat fee.\\n\\n3) Call up your gas and electric company and ask for advice on how you can reduce your bills.  They will give you some good advice.  It saved me about $200 per month during the winter.\\n\\nB. Credit Cards\\nGet rid of all the credits except for only one.  Credits cards can get you into trouble fast.\\n\\nIf you have many, then you should look pay the most to the credit card that has the least balance.  All others you should pay the minimum.   Once it is paid, repeat the same with the remaining cards.\\n\\nThis also works for any other debts you may have.\\n\\nC. Spend Less\\n1)  Use coupons when you go food shopping.  Buy healthy and natural food for the family.\\n\\n2) Don't buy anything for yourself personally for a while (i.e. clothes, toys, etc.) until your situation is under control - unless of course you absolutely need to.\\n\\nD. Saving Money\\n1) If you can, have your employer automatically deposit part of your paycheck into a different bank account.  This way you won't see the amount in your checking account.  This is a great way to save money.\\n\\nE. Stay on top of your finance - stay disciplined\\nPay your bills on time and balance your checkbook often.  A great way to do this, is to use online banking.  There is a bill pay service you should sign up for with www.paytrust.com.  All your bills become viewable online and you can setup up automatic payment schedules.  This will ensure all your bills get paid on time.\\n\\nF. Donate money\\nI know this sounds crazy when you are trying to save money, but trust me.   If you lend God money we will give you manifold more.  Do it as often as you can and whatever amount.  Even if it is $1.\\n\\nBest of luck.\\n\\nps.  Pray to God for help.  He will answer.\n\nAnswer:",

We met online so since then we've been going to each other's countries on tourist visas and staying the entire length of it, which gets difficult and expensive... and hard to hold down steady jobs. I just can't figure anything out, you can't just go get married because it doesn't count, right? What can we do? I'm American, and it doesn't matter whose country we live in, we just want to be together. It's not a quickie wedding to gain a green card, it's really love. It would be best if we got married in U.K. (Wales) because of his career. I'd also like information on how to get my pets there. 3 cats and a Rottweiler... my Rottweiler is also listed as a dangerous dog because of some liars, it's completely untrue but would that cause problems? Anyone with answers to either of these questions PLEASE help me. Especially about marriage. Thanks so much in advance, I'm heartbroken about this.\nAnswer: Well, pretty much all you have to do is obtain a marriage license to get married in England. You don't have to be a citizen, but you still need the valid license.  Go here:  http://www.vs.gov.bc.ca/marriage/howto.html?SMSESSION=NO\\n\\nKeep any information that  you have on hand about your visits to see each other.  In case you ever want him to get a green card for the U.S., the immigration offices like to see that you have actually met and known each other for a while and that it isn't just a ploy to gain citizenship. Believe me, I know this from experience and have been in almost the exact same situation you are in.  It can be difficult, but if you love each other, hang in there and it'll work itself out:)  \\n\\nAs for your pets, go to this website:  http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/index.htm\\nYou shouldn't have any problems, but you will probably need statements or certificates from a vet saying the animals are in good health, no diseases, etc.  \\n\\nI wish you the best of luck.\n\nAnswer:",

In the US, this industry is strongly associated with Southern states, especially the illegal \"moonshine\" corn whiskey that was produced secretly to avoid government taxation in the 1800s. On a recent visit to my parents, who live down in North Carolina, we visited a cultural museum where one of the featured exhibits was a still (the equipment for producing corn whiskey.) To the best of my knowledge, there are no stills in museums up here in Boston. Most sources that believe this to be the root of the word point to song The Blue Tail Fly (more popularly known as Jimmy Crack Corn) which tells the story of a slave who escapes punishment when his master is killed in a riding accident - even though it happened because he failed to keep flies from biting the master's nervous horse.\n\nAnswer:",

There is a metal disc inside that you flex back and forth to activate the heat.  This makes the clear liquid turn opaque and warms up.  To reactive, you boil the warm pack for 5 minutes until the inside fluid turns clear.\\nWhat fluid is contained in this?  What does the flexing of the metal disc do?\\n\\nThanks in advance!\nAnswer: Your heat pack probably contains Sodium Acetate.\\n\\nFlexing a metal \"trigger\" within the sealed container causes a few molecules of liquid to crystallize.  These few molecule start a whole chain reaction which starts a chain reaction causing the supercooled solution to change from a liquid to a solid as crystals form.\\n\\nThis phase change causes the pack to give out heat. When the heat pack contents crystallize, its temperature returns its freezing point, and then you can recycle it by boiling. \\n\\nWhen they pack is boiled, the crystals dissolve in their own water of crystallization so the heat pack returns back to a liquid state.\\n\\nI hope this was helpful!\n\nAnswer:",

I am thinking of switching from one to the other. I want objective views to help me make the decision.\nAnswer: If you're a nurse now you could teach in nursing school or teach science and math classes in college. Depending on where you teach you could be teaching working adults who are eager to learn and willing to do the work it takes to do well in college. Science and allied health instructors in college are often highly respected and, in the right place, well-compensated.\\n\\nFor teaching: Do you have a deep or broad practical knowledge of a subject? That will help you prepare the class structure, find the right materials, and prepare your lectures. Do you have a passion for the subject? That helps you explain difficult concepts, answer all kinds of questions from all kinds of students, and to have the energy and stamina to work with students who aren't \"getting it\" right away. Do you remember what it was like when you were a student - what worked in class and what didn't? That will help you create the best possible class for the subject. To teach you should like public speaking and be fairly good at it. With teaching you need to be able to see the big picture and the small details. Just like nursing. \\n\\nOf course the other thing they have in common is helping people, but in teaching you have far more time to work with individuals as they progress, you have an opportunity to experiment with various techniques and resources, and you're usually not under pressure to make immediate, life-or-death decisions. Teaching can be incredibly rewarding - when you make a lasting impression on a student you can be sure that what you have taught will be carried far and wide in the ripple effects.\n\nAnswer:",

It would still be a failure to those around you but you could silently applaud yourself for a job well failed. Second I know a vegetarian that won't eat them just because they are called \"animal\" crackers, her sister is a vegan and won't eat them because most are made with egg or milk product. I would look at the ingredients and if they have animal byproducts that you won't eat then don't buy em..Unless thier for me... because I will bite all thier little heads off and then eat a steak... \\nNow this third one is a little different. You ask why they would sterilize them and I asked my mother who is a nurse what she thought about it.. She simply put me in this situation. \" If your about to give lethal drugs to someone and let's say you used a dirty needle.\" I said \"yeah...so\", \"And what happens if you slip and the needle goes into your arm?\" I said \"It would never happen, but yeah good point.\" So I would have to say that if you are using a needle, even if it's not for your arm... you wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of something that isn't sterilized. Trust me it's not for the safety of the inmate about to be put down.... It's for the safety of the nurse givin the shot.\\n\\nHope this clarifies anything your still asking yourself.

Do these changes represent a dealignment and/or realignment?  How has each of the following contributed to these changes: (a) conversion, (b) migration, (c) mobilization, and (d) generational replacement?\nAnswer: From what I remember as a Southerner, the Democratic Party voted OVERWHELMINGLY against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, yet still retain 90% of the voters from the affected minority communities. The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln voted overwhelmingly FOR Civil Rights. How these minorities can ever trust a Democrat to help them is beyond me. The same racist Democrats who voted against Civil Rights then gave the minorities a body blow and bussed them into unfamiliar neighborhoods while their own schools were let to fall into ruin. Then came the young men's meat-grinder of Viet Nam......created exclusively by President John Kennedy and extended/escalated by the Anti-Christ President Lyndon Johnson......and finally ended by the Republican President Richard Nixon, thankfully, while the minorities still had young men left alive.\\n\\nLearning a good lesson from the building of minority \"Projects\" in our inner-cities, Democrats in power unleashed an Urban Renewal plan to totally destroy historic buildings and old minority neighborhoods all through the South in the name of progress and revitalization. The further gentrification of these neighborhoods could totally wipe out any identifiable minority landmarks and send the minorities streaming into the countryside trying to find affordable housing........or in a worse-case scenario the minorities will be offered another \"helping hand\" by the Democratic Party and be housed in planned neighborhoods of typically poor construction and suspect security.\\n\\nMore white Republicans have moved to the South but cannot seem to convert any minorities into their ranks, except the Hispanic minority. As Democrats push to create State Lotteries across the South the white and Asian students begin to get unequal availability to university scholarships while the other minorities lose BILLIONS of dollars a year on gambling in those same lotteries......meanwhile the students in these gambling households do not get a fair percentage of the scholarship money. That's because the Democrats that voted for the lotteries also voted for the exclusion of C and D students from the lottery money pools. There should have been trade schools built and special remedial colleges built with that money to help the unfortunate children of the gambling parents.\\n\\nThe migration of Hispanics to the South and the region's reliance on their workforce will force the Democrats to wonder how they can convert Catholic populations to accept the voluntary genocide that many other minorities have willingly accepted in the abortion of their youngest generation.\\n\\nFinally, in a last-gasp effort of true integration the Democratic Party will surely support the total 50-50 integration of all historically minority universities in the United States.\\n\\nThe Republicans and the Democrats cannot be trusted to protect our Civil Rights or our Civil Liberties. Nobody in the East, South, North or West can fix these two parties.\\n\\nThey both prey upon us and we smile and take it. We deserve them...........until we create a party of dissent and common sense........a party of dignity, heart, hard work and fairness.\n\nAnswer:",

Japan remians sovereign, under rule of the Shogun. The Emperor is largely symbolic.\\n\\n1854 - 1900 - Japan invites Germany to train the army, Britain to train the navy, and the shogunate disappears as the Meiji Restoration occurs (Emperor Meiji, who brought Japan into the modern industrial age). Japan industrializes, zaibatsu, or business combines ruled by important families, expand, and Japan becomes relatively modern industrially. \\n\\nGlobally, Japan is looked down upon as an \"asiatic\" nation of \"yellow skinned slant-eyes\" who could never equal a western nation.\\n\\n1850 - 1900 - Golden age of colonization - Britain, France, and Germany carve up Africa, and other independent territories. Japan has no colonies, just a few Pacific Islands.\\n\\n1905 - Russia and Japan go to war over Japanese desire to expand its influence in Asia, particularly Korea and northern China as well as the Sakhalin Islands.\\n\\nJapan kicks Russia's butt, sinking her far easter fleet and gaining new territory, including the Sakhalin Islands.\\n\\n1910 - Japan conquers Korea.\\n\\n1920's and 30's - Japan continues to expand into China, setting up the puppet state of Manchukuo in northern China. The US, which supports China, is concerned, and cuts off supplies of strategic materials to the Japanese. Japan is viewed with suspicion by western nations.\\n\\n1936 - \"Rape of Nanking\" Japanese forces capture the city of Nanking and pillage and rape. Thousands of civilians are raped and killed during a short period. Japan's international reputation falls even more.\\n\\nlate 1930's and 1940 - America moves to cut Japanese purchase of strategic material totally. No oil or steel goes to Japan from the US. Japan is outraged. Japanese planners beging to plan removing the US as a force in the pacific and expanding Japanese military operations to secure supplies of raw materials (East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere).\\n\\n1941 - Japan, ruled by the Emperor Hirohito, but run by Prime Minister Tojo, an army general, bombs Pearl Harbour and begins military action in the Pacific.\\n\\nAugust, 1945 - Japan surrenders after being defeated on land and sea, and being hit by two atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\n\\nSeptember, 1945 - General Douglas MacArthur takes over control of Japan. Emperoro Hirohito stays in. This allows the Japanese people to save face and gains the Americans support by all parts of society in Japan. \\n\\n1945 - 1950's - Japan recovers from the effects of the war. Like the Marshall Plan in Europe, the US helps Japan to rebuild, and works with the Japanese to bring in a democratic constitution and a democratic form of government.\\n\\n1950 - Korean War begins. Japan is an important staging point for American forces.\\n\\n1950's - 1970's - Japanese products are sold world wide. Japanese goods are known as shoddy and cheap. Made in Japan is not a sign of quality.\\n\\n1970's - 1990's - Japan's economy continues to grow, while the US suffers through the economic malaise of the OPEC embargo, Vietnam and Watergate. Japanese quality improves. Toyota, Datsun, Sony, and other Japanese firms become quality global brands through the late 1970's and throughout the 1980's.\\n\\nJapan is now considered as an American ally and works closely with the US in economic matters, as well as giving civilian support to military endeavours, such as Iraq. Japan's constitution forbids the country from having a standing army or navy, although it does permit a \"Defense Force\" to defend the homeland.\\n\\nJapan is now a key player in the global world, both politically and economically. What a difference from being voluntarily totally cut off up to 1854!\n\nAnswer:",

Dust is also responsible for the pinkish sky on\\nMars, as seen in the photographs returned from the Viking landers.\\n\\nIf the atmosphere contains lots of dust, the direct light from the Sun\\nor Moon may occasionally get some quite unusual color. Sometimes,\\ngreen and blue moons have been reported. These phenomena are quite\\nrare though---they happen only \"once in a blue moon....\" :) The dust\\nresponsible for these unusual color phenomena is most often volcanic\\nin origin. When El Chicon erupted in 1982, this caused unusually\\nstrongly colored sunsets in equatorial areas for more than one year.\\nThe much bigger volcanic explosion at Krakatoa, some 110 years ago,\\ncaused green and blue moons worldwide for a few years.\\n\\nOne possible exception to the above discussion is if the clouds on the\\nplanet are composed of a strongly colored chemical. This might occur\\non Jupiter, where the clouds are thought to contain sulfur, phosphorus,\\nand/or various organic chemicals.\\n\\nIt's also worth pointing out that the light of the planet's primary is\\nquite insignificant. Our eyes are highly adaptable to the dominating\\nillumination and perceive it as \"white,\" within a quite wide range of\\npossible colors. During daytime, we perceive the light from the Sun\\n(6000 K) as white, and at night we perceive the light from our\\nincandescent lamps (2800 K, like a late, cool M star) as white. Only\\nif we put these two lights side-by-side, at comparable intensities,\\nwill we perceive a clear color difference.\\n\\nIf the Sun was a hot star (say of spectral type B), it's likely we\\nstill would perceive its light as \"white\" and the sky's color as blue\n\nAnswer:",

In essence, civil engineering is a profession which makes the world a more habitable place to live in.\\n\\nEngineering has developed from observations of the ways natural and constructed systems react and from the development of empirical equations that provide bases for design.

If you believe in God and the bible, why would one part of it be wrong and the other right? Were they written far apart from each other (in terms of WHEN they were written)?\nAnswer: The word Bible actually means \"little books.\"  It took over 1600 years to write.  The Bible is not an unrelated assortment or collection of man made fragments from Jewish and Christian literature. Rather, it is an organizational book, highly unified and interconnected in its various segments, which indeed reflect the systematic orderliness of the Creator-Author himself. God’s dealings with Israel in giving them a comprehensive law code as well as regulations governing matters even down to small details of camp life—things that were later mirrored in the Davidic kingdom as well as in the congregational arrangement among first-century Christians—reflect and magnify this organizational aspect of the Bible.\\n\\nThe Bible has a theme that is carried out from Genesis to Revelation which is basically, 'from paradise lost to paradise regained'  It talks about how God is going to use his Kingdom to bring back the paradise conditions that Adam and Eve lost and vindicate his name in the process.  The Hebrew scriptures (OT) talk about the history of the Jews as they watched and waited for the Messiah.  The Christian Greek scriptures (NT) tell about the Messiah and what the future holds as he, the King of God's Kingdom works to bring back paradise to the Earth.\n\nAnswer:",

What should I expect after the surgery (Post op)?\nAnswer: Liposuction surgery is very safe nowadays. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.\\n\\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\\n\\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

Do your parents know that you are with this guy, because i don't think they would want you with a guy that threatens to kill you. You need some serious intervention. You say you can't call the police, but that's probably because you only try to talk to someone after something happened and you're afraid. You can't be with him 24 hours a day, so what you need to do is talk to someone and let them know what is going on when he is not around, hopefully you can get enough people involved (including his parents) so the situation won't get out of control. What are you doing with a guy carrying around a gun anyway? He obviously is not the dating type. You really should try to get out of this relationship before someone gets killed, because from the sound of it this guy is unstable and would hurt or endanger anyone to get to you. I hope you take my advice because there is no way that you deserve to be treated so badly, you need to realize that if he loved you he wouldn't be treating you this way, you are worth more than you think, because if you knew what you were worth you wouldn't put up with something so bad. Besides, while you're with this guy you could be missing out on a great guy that you really deserve. Keep your head up, and remember who you are.\n\nAnswer:",

Mainly they grew wheat and barley. \\n\\nThe Egyptians made the wheat into bread and into soup and porridge, and they also added hops to make the barley into beer. In fact, some people think the real reason that the Egyptians first began growing grain was to make beer. This is an Egyptian model of beer jars (from the Louvre), which the Egyptians made to put in your grave when you died so you would have beer in the next world.\\n\\n(from the Louvre, Paris, France)\\nThe Egyptians also ate meat. You could go to a butcher shop and buy meat there, just as people do today. Only because it rarely rains in Egypt, they could have the meat outside in the courtyard of the store instead of inside. Here is a model of a butcher shop, also from somebody's grave. Can you see the different cuts of meat all laid out? At the very bottom there is a whole leg of mutton.\\nBut the Egyptians would not eat pigs (bacon or ham or pork or salami) because they thought pigs carried leprosy. They ate beef and mutton and duck and goose. \\nFor dessert, the Egyptians liked to eat dates. This is a picture of some real Egyptian dates which were put into somebody's grave for them to eat in the next world, and which were preserved in the dry climate for three thousand years until archaeologists dug them up again.\\nArchaeologists have also found seeds which show that the Egyptians grew watermelons, and other kinds of melon.\n\nAnswer:",

Surrounding them are dead stars in the form of dwarves, or even some very ancient population II stars.\\n\\nA few things that were incorrectly stated, are that galactic rotation CAN be measured, but it is immensely slow (we are talking one rotation across maybe a couple hundred million years or so, for small galaxies).  Considering that our average-sized milky way is 35,000 light years across, travelling linearly down the center, it would take our sun (going 60,000 km/h) 630,000,000 years to reach the other side. Since it is travelling circularly, it would take something closer to a billion or so years. Likely our solar system has completed about one or two \"galactic years,\" but it is a slow, slow process.\\n\\nFurthermore, not all galaxies rotate, however. Newer galaxies, such as clusters, have no center point nor supermassive black hole, so they are for the most part stationary in terms of rotation.\\n\\nThe blackhole at the center of our galaxy, as I state above, is closer to 200,000 times the mass of our sun, not the giant underestimation of 1000 times as stated above.\\n\\nAnd despite what is says below there isn't a \"blackhole at the center of our universe.\" They are the centroids of galaxies, not the universe. There is no central, universal rotation point as such. Also the explanation below fails to explain why galaxies are denser in their centers - and even then some aren't.

Why?\nQuestion: The CD-ROM drive icon never appears under My Computer or Windows Explorer. It was working a few days ago, and I could both read and burn CDs. We noticed that the CD-ROM icon disappeared 2 days back. Popping in a CD etc does not help. The drivers seem ok, and Control Panel -> System -> Drivers and Disk Drive (Samsung) indicated status as ok. But the drive itself is not recognized and CD's inserted into it cannot be read.\nAnswer: I am assuming you mean system > hardware > device manager > CD ROM drives?\\n\\nIt is possible that the driver got corrupted.  The easiest thing to do is to right click and uninstall the CD ROM.  If you uninstall andclose out you should shortly see \"new hardware found\" with the name of the CD that you have.  If this DOES NOT happen then you probably have a physical problem with the drive.  If it does, then it reinstalls and you can see if it works.\\n\\nAlso, check to see it the drive LED goes on when you insert a disk (getting power), does it open and close when you press the button? \\n\\nIf that does not work (assuming you have not made any other changes/additions to the hardware since it was last working) open up the computer (after diconnecting all power of course) and check to see if the cables are securly connected.\\n\\nOther things to try if it has power and appears to be visually working - change the ribbon cable. Make sure it is jumpered correctly.  Try setting it up on the second controller (there could be a problem with the controller card).  Try connecting a different power cable to the CD.\\n\\nAfter going through this \"ttask\" list and you are still failing then I am about 90% sure your drive is bad.\\n\\nIs it still under warranty?\n\nAnswer:",

I thought that is was a good idea to sign up because you go at your own pace.  so I researched it a little bit and their website looked legit and they said they were accredited.  So I sent them a check for 5 dollars and they said they would get me started and I would make payments to them every month. After I gave them my check, they asked if they could record my voice saying that I want to join the school.  So I did.  Well, they send me my first semester's materials, and they are like middle school literature.  And they even have books that look like they were photocopied.  So in reading the material, it says that if you don't send them your first exams in a certain amount of time, they will drop you from the school, so I didn't send anything to them for a few months because during this time, I found that they are accredited but the president of their board that does the accredidation, is the president of the school.  They accredited themselves.  Also, there is a difference between regionally accredited and nationally accredited.  I found out that after I had already given them the 5 dollars, that most colleges would not let me transfer credits from ashworth.  Most of the colleges had never even heard of ashworth.  Now Ashworth college is trying to come after me for 9 thousand dollars for the whole semester!! When speaking to others, I was told that this one person did an aerial view of the address and all that was there was a warehouse.  There was no school like there was in the pictures on their website.  The same person who did this, called the college and said he was in the area and he wanted to come by and meet some of the staff and they told him he couldnt There are quite a few people including myself who are interested in opening a class action law suit against the school for fraud and deception.

Jesus counters by saying \"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.\"  Seventy-seven may also be \"seventy times seven\".  \\n\\nThere may be other passages, but this is the only one I could find.  \\n\\nYou can visit www.biblegateway.com or a good Bible concordance (like Strong's Exhaustive Concordance) for more info, and I also recommend checking out a commentary.

First is HEREDITY, every person inherited some of his characteristics from the parents, on the ratio of 4:1. This kind of characteristics can never be changed cause it is in the genes that makes you genetically similar to either your father or mother. This characteristics cannot be modified and are observed in the color of eyes; shape of the body, fingers, face; size of chest.

Beg, middle or end of month?\nQuestion: is there a cost savings? Is there delayed payment? \\nPlease give details in your answer! \\nthanks\nAnswer: 2 words...prepaid interest. it is best to close your loan at the end of the month. you will pay less interest and you will still get a month or so off from your next mortgage payment. If your original loan payment is around the first of the month try to close your loan by the 25th or so that way you wont have to pay your next month's payment, and by the time the new lender mails you a statement, it wont be scheduled to pay until the next month.\n\nAnswer:",

It started from a stiff neck went to my shoulder and now my whole arm to the tips of my fingers. No matter what Im doing, the only way it goes away is when I lift it over my head.Could this be from a heart attack or stroke, that Im not aware of, or is this what they call arthritis?\nAnswer: The stiffness in the neck indicated you have a problem that has increased to allow an inflammation process to involve the nerves of the brachial plexus..(the nerves to the arm). You will find there is still restriction of motion of the head to one side. When a nerve has pressure on it for any extended period of time, it acts as an anesthetic.. explaining the numbness. The tingling telling you a nerve is under a state of irritation. Is similar to what the aftermath is after you hit your crazy bone.\\n\\nPerhaps you should consider highly, the consultation with a doctor of Chiropractic.. and have the cause of the problem taken care of.\n\nAnswer:",

And what's the difference?\nAnswer: The more info you have the better.  If you use a mortgage broker they are going to search their base of investors, whether they are using big money like Washington mutual or some other lending sources or private money.  You don't want to have every mortgage broker run your credit because the more hits you get asking for your rating the more your rating can be affected. The best thing to do is check your rating yourself and then present your info to the broker and ask him to give you a good faith estimate.  There are many things to watch for when doing these transactions so do your homework and take no shortcuts.  The lender, whether it be the bank or investors, is going to look at 1.  Your income, through check stubs with year to date info\\n2.  Your credit rating, 680 or higher is pretty good\\n3.  Your current profession and how long you've been in it, or on the current job.\\nAnd maybe some other things also.  I just got done with a loan package so somethings are still fresh in my memory.  Make sure you get the info from a broker or a banker and then study the papers ask questions and don't go to every mortgage broker in town having them run your credit. There is a website for someone I know you might email him and get some answers,Good Luck!!!!!\n\nAnswer:",

We also take roadtrips together to the coast and to the country for walks, usually followed by dinner and its just the 2 of us.This happens at least every 2 weeks, if not on a weekly basis. We’re attracted to each other, flirt with each other, we’re in touch practically everyday, can only open up too me,feels very comfortable with me, enjoys spending time with me,we trust each other etc\\n\\nShe doesn’t like it when I mention other girls that I’m interested in or ask her for advice concerning them.She always tells me that she never pulled when she went out,she’s not interested in anyone, don’t fancy anyone,etc\\n\\nWe kissed once(very passionate,all over each other)a few months back and she said we should remain friends.She said that I don’t do it for her(also kiss), but still finds me attractive and the thought of us being intimate doesn’t repulse her. So how can’t I do it for her?\nAnswer: I know what you're going through. There is a certain male friend of mine that I have secretly felt this way about...and dreamt about for a few years now. I've said little things to see what his reaction was, and he just really did not seem interested in me for anything else than a friend. I'm engaged now....and sometimes I wish I would've said something, just to see what would've happened. Although I would never change anything between my fiance and I.\\n\\nI'm thinking that this girl feels the same way about you. Sit her down and talk to her. Tell her of all your feelings towards her. Ask for hers in return. A few months back, when you guys kissed - was there passion? Or what it just a kiss? Tell her your opinion on this, and ask her for hers. You guys are best friends - there should be no reason why you guys can't talk about this. \\n\\nLet her know that anything you guys do together isn't just for you. That if you guys end up kissing again or even being intimate, it's not because you're some filthy slob trying to get in her panties. Let her know that you'd only do it because the timing and the person was perfect. It really can't get any simpler than that.\\n\\nWhatever and however you chose to go about this, please do something. You wouldn't want to go on living the rest of your life wondering what would've happened had you said something, right? \\n\\nJust sit her down, take her by her hands and take a deep breath - and let the words flow. You guys seem really close, and you seem like an awfully sweet guy. I wish the both of you the best of luck. Don't go for not having your girl. ;)\n\nAnswer:",

But for someone with bipolar disorder, these ups and downs can be so extreme they can interfere with daily life. Sometimes they can even be dangerous. \\n\\nOne day a person with bipolar disorder may feel so depressed that they can't get out of bed. Work may seem impossible. \\n\\nOn another day that person may feel great, full of endless energy and creativity. But other people might think that their actions are reckless and out of control. \\n\\nBipolar disorder is a lifelong medical condition that can be confusing and unpredictable, but it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Learning more about bipolar disorder can be helpful in managing this medical illness. \\n\\nThere are four main types of bipolar disorder: \\nBipolar I Disorder \\nBipolar II Disorder \\nCyclothymic Disorder \\nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified \\n\\n\\nBipolar I Disorder - Bipolar I disorder involves one or more manic or mixed episodes, and often one or more major depressive episodes. A depressive episode may last for several weeks or months. Between episodes of bipolar I disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\\n\\nBipolar II Disorder - Bipolar II disorder involves one or more major depressive episodes along with at least one hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes have symptoms similar to manic episodes but are less severe. Between episodes of bipolar II disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\\n \\nCyclothymic Disorder - Cyclothymic disorder is a long-term fluctuating mood disturbance with periods of hypomania and periods of depression. It is a milder form of bipolar disorder. That's because the periods of both depression and hypomania are shorter, less severe, and do not occur with regularity.\\n \\nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified - This type of bipolar disorder is when the person does not fit into the types of bipolar disorder mentioned above. The experiences of bipolar disorder vary from person to person. Just like the other types of bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is treatable.\n\nAnswer:",

How do you go about betting on stock markets?\nAnswer: Stock : An instrument that signifies an ownership position (called equity) in a corporation, and represents a claim on its proportional share in the corporation's assets and profits. Ownership in the company is determined by the number of shares a person owns divided by the total number of shares outstanding. For example, if a company has 1000 shares of stock outstanding and a person owns 50 of them, then he/she owns 5% of the company. Most stock also provides voting rights, which give shareholders a proportional vote in certain corporate decisions. Only a certain type of company called a corporation has stock; other types of companies such as sole proprietorships and limited partnerships do not issue stock. also called equity or equity securities or corporate stock.\n\nAnswer:",

Depends on what type of Leukemia the diagnosis is.  And yes....there are people who are cured of Leukemia!  Some types are more \"treatable\"....the term remission is usually used for a period following the Leukemia....in most cases after 5 years the Leukemia is considered to be cured if there has been no relapse.  There is a risk of secondary diseases with Leukemia chemotherapy's and other treatments just the same as any type of cancer.  Medicine has come a long way in the treatment of Leukemia in the past 20 years....giving many diagnosed with Leukemia a good second chance at life!!!\n\nAnswer:",

The measured amount of   CO2   produced was   5.256 g,   while that of   H2O   was   4.303 g.   No other products were produced in the reaction.\\n\\nHow many moles of   carbon   were in the original sample that underwent combustion ?\nAnswer: Gimme a minute...\\n\\nFirst guess is 0.1195 moles of Carbon.\\n\\nHow? Since you got 5.256 g of CO2, if you divide that with the molecular mass of CO2 you'll get the moles of CO2:\\n\\n5.256 g X (1 mole of CO2 / 44g of CO2) = 0.1195 moles of CO2\\n\\n[  44 from C (12g/mole) and O2(2 x 16g/mole)  ]\\n\\nfrom 0.1195 moles of CO2 multiply that with (1 mole of Carbon per 1 mole of Carbon Dioxide CO2) which makes the number of moles of CO2 = to the number of moles of Carbon. Not a single molecule of Carbon is wasted, so I guess it's safe to assume that's also the number of moles of Carbon in the reactants.\n\nAnswer:",

Any help is much appreciated.\nAnswer: The term sulfide (sulphide in British English) refers to several types of chemical compounds containing sulfur in its lowest oxidation number of −2.\\n\\nFormally, \"sulfide\" is the dianion, S2−, which exists in strongly alkaline aqueous solutions formed from H2S or alkali metal salts such as Li2S, Na2S, and K2S. Sulfide is exceptionally basic and, with a pKa > 14, it does not exist in appreciable concentrations even in highly alkaline water. Instead, sulfide combines with protons to form HS−, which is variously called hydrogen sulfide ion, hydrosulfide ion, sulfhydryl ion, or bisulfide ion. At still lower pH's (<7), HS− converts to H2S, hydrogen sulfide. Thus, the exact sulfur species obtained upon dissolving sulfide salts depends on the pH of the final solution.\n\nAnswer:",

Better tuners are always nice, nothing sucks more then bad tuners going out when your playing. I dont honestly think the nut is gonna help unless its seriously ruined. Pickups are nice, but none of this even matters if your using cheap cables, and a cheap amp too. Everything has to be good quality or theres really no point in adding to your guitar.I mean if you get let say a pair of emgs put in, they would normally be great mid-high range guitar tones, but if your amp doesnt have good distortion and sounds grainy, well your upgrade is only doing half of what it should.The cheapest thing on my list is cables-bad cables suck tone.You could also get a nice lil graphic eq, they can help a lot for a lil money.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm being serious, so should you.\\n\\nMy friend Kim has an older sister named Allison.  When Allison got back from a nearby town partying for her birthday (she's 16), her mom took her to the gynecologist to see if she'd has $ex.  She hadn't.\\nBut my question is, how does a gynecologist tell if you've had $ex before?  If I've stuck something into my vagina once (I'm young, experimental, etc - don't judge me!), ten would it look as though I've had $ex?\\n\\nHonestly, I'm being serious and truthful, please help me by answering!\nAnswer: A doctor cannot tell whether you are a virgin or not. What a doctor can tell is whether your hymen has been broken or not. A female can break her hymen in many different ways, such as horseback riding. Also, some hymens have a large enough opening to accommodate a penis during sex so that the hymen does not tear. If you are concerned about a doctor inferring that a torn hymen means you are having sex, do not worry. It is not the doctor's position to make any assumptions about you, even though he or she might ask you questions regarding your sexual activity. For your best interest, you should answer your doctor truthfully. Your doctor can better care for you if he or she knows all of your medical history, including whether you are sexually active or not. In addition, doctors have a bond of patient confidentiality with their clients, so a doctor cannot tell your parents if you are sexually active if you do not ask him or her to tell them. \\n\\nhttp://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/print.php?article=faq&refid=310\\n\\nIt is very difficult to know if a woman is still a virgin, even if there is tightness as a doctor examines her. There are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. For example, a woman's vagina may be tight because she is nervous while being examined by the doctor, or then again, her muscles may be relaxed and she may never have experienced intercourse before. A woman may also not have a hymen, and never had one, so this would not indicate her state of \"virginity\". The best way to know if a woman has had penile penetration still remains to ask her. Most doctors will also ask their female patients if they have had sex before, when they are about to make a gynecological examination for the first time. \\n\\nhttp://ideas.uqam.ca/~dsexo/english/9906e/qa0384-1518m.htm\n\nAnswer:",
