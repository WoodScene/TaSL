[USER]: I'm not thrilled with that option. What else could I rent? [SYSTEM]: There's a Civic available, which is also considered a standard car. It's available at Estacion Buenavista for pickup on the day after tomorrow as well. [USER]: I would really prefer a medium-sized car. Are there any available? [SYSTEM]: Yes, I have a Corolla available at Benito Juarez International Airport for pickup on the day after tomorrow. That's also considered a standard car. [USER]: What's the total cost to reserve that car? [SYSTEM]: That reservation will total $56. [USER]: That sounds good. Would you please reserve that car? [SYSTEM]: Certainly. Please confirm: you are reserving a standard car for pickup from Benito Juarez International Airport on the day after tomorrow at 1:30 pm. You'll return it next Tuesday. [USER]: Yes, that's perfect.
