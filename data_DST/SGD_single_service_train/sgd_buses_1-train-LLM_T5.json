Can you find me one? I want to leave on the 3rd of this month. [SYSTEM]: Sure. Where are you headed to? And what city are you departing from? [USER]: I'm going from New York to Philly. [SYSTEM]: There are 7 buses available for that route. One of them leaves at 7:40 am and has 0 transfers. Its ticket is $24. [USER]: $24 is a bit more expensive than I thought. Can you find me a cheaper bus? I need tickets for 4 people. [SYSTEM]: There is another bus which costs just $19. It leaves at 8 am and also has 0 transfers. [USER]: Which station does this bus leave from? And which station does it go to? [SYSTEM]: It goes from Port Authority Station to the Intercity Terminal. [USER]: Actually, I don't think we all need to go together. I'll go on March 9th instead. Can you find me a bus for 2 which leaves then? [SYSTEM]: Sure. There are 5 such buses. One leaves at 11:30 am. Its ticket is $21 and its route has 0 transfers. [USER]: That's perfect. [SYSTEM]: Should I purchase your tickets now?
